which chilled the very marrow in the merchant's bones ah gregor my child he shouted you have already forgotten my commands holy st nicholas what a bad memory the boy has why he can't be trusted to do business i must attend to the shop myself out of the way march he swung his terrible whip and gregor with his two assistants darted under the counter and made their escape the prince then entered the booth took up a yard stick and cried out in a voice which could be heard from one end of the town to the other ladies and gentlemen have the kindness to come and examine our stock of goods we have silks and satins and all kinds of ladies wear also velvet cloth cotton and linen for the gentlemen will your lordships deign to choose here are stockings and handkerchiefs of the finest we understand how to measure your lordships and we sell cheap we give no change and take no small money whoever has no cash may have credit every thing sold below cost on account of closing up the establishment ladies and gentlemen give us a call everybody in kinesma flocked to the booth and for three hours prince alexis measured and sold either for scant cash or long credit until the last article had been disposed of and the shelves were empty there was great rejoicing in the community over the bargains made that day when all was over gregor was summoned and the cash received paid into his hands it won't take you long to count it said the prince but here is a list of debts to be collected which will furnish you with pleasant occupation and enable you to exercise your memory would your worship condescend to take dinner to day with your humble assistant he would esteem it a favor to be permitted to wait upon you with whatever his poor house can supply gregor gave a glance at the whip under the prince's arm and begged to be excused but the latter would take no denial and carried out the comedy to the end by giving the merchant the place of honor at his table and dismissing him with the present of a fine pup of his favorite breed perhaps the animal acted as a mnemonic symbol for gregor was never afterwards accused of forgetfulness if this trick put the prince in a good humor some thing presently occurred which carried him to the opposite extreme while taking his customary siesta one afternoon a wild young fellow one of his noble poor relations who sponged at the castle happened to pass along a corridor outside of the very hall where his highness was snoring two ladies in waiting looked down from an upper window the young fellow perceived them and made signs to attract their attention having succeeded in this he attempted by all sorts of antics and grimaces to make them laugh or speak but he failed for the slumber flag waved over them and its fear was upon them then in a freak of incredible rashness he sang in a loud voice the first line of a popular ditty and took to his heels no one had ever before dared to insult the sacred quiet the prince was on his feet in a moment and rushed into the corridor dropping his mantle of sables by the way shouting bring me the wretch who sang the domestics scattered before him for his face was terrible to look upon some of them had heard the voice indeed but not one of them had seen the culprit who al ready lay upon a heap of hay in one of the stables and appeared to be sunk in innocent sleep who was it who was it yelled the prince foaming at the mouth with rage as he rushed from chamber to chamber at last he halted at the top of the great flight of steps leading into the court yard and repeated his demand in a voice of thunder the servants trembling kept at a safe distance and some of them ventured to state that the offender could not be discovered the prince turned and entered one of the state apartments whence came the sound of porcelain smashed on the floor and mirrors shivered on the walls whenever they heard that sound the immates of the castle knew that a hurricane was let loose they deliberated hurriedly and anxiously what was to be done in his fits of blind animal rage there was nothing of which the prince was not capable and the fit could be allayed only by finding a victim no one however was willing to be a curtius for the others and meanwhile the storm was increasing from minute to minute some of the more active and shrewd of the household pitched upon the leader of the band a simple minded good natured serf named waska they entreated him to take upon himself the crime of having sung offering to have his punishment mitigated in every possible way he was proof against their tears but not against the money which they finally offered in order to avert the storm the agreement was made although waska both scratched his head and shook it as he reflected upon the probable result the prince after his work of destruction again appeared upon the steps and with hoarse voice and flashing eyes began to announce that every soul in the castle should receive a hundred lashes when a noise was heard in the court and amid cries of here he is we've got him highness the poor waska bound hand and foot was brought forward they placed him at the bottom of the steps the prince descended until the two stood face to face the others looked on from courtyard door and window a pause ensued during which no one dared to breathe at last prince alexis spoke in a loud and terrible voice it was you who sang it yes your highness it was i waska replied in a scarcely audible tone dropping his head and mechanically drawing his shoulders together as if shrinking from the coming blow it was full three minutes before the prince again spoke he still held the whip in his hand his eyes fixed and the muscles of his face rigid all at once the spell seemed to dissolve his hand fell and he said in his ordinary voice you sing remarkably well go now you shall have ten rubles and an embroidered caftan for your singing but any one would have made a great mistake who dared to awaken prince alexis a second time in the same manner v prince boris in st petersburg adopted the usual habits of his class he dressed elegantly he drove a dashing troika he played and lost more frequently than he won he took no special pains to shun any form of fashionable dissipation his money went fast it is true but twenty five thousand rubles was a large sum in those days and boris did not inherit his father's expensive constitution he was presented to the empress but his thin face and mild melancholy eyes did not make much impression upon that ponderous woman he frequented the salons of the nobility but saw no face so beautiful as that of parashka the serf maiden who personated venus for simon petrovitch the fact is he had a dim undeveloped instinct of culture and a crude half conscious worship of beauty both of which qualities found just enough nourishment in the life of the capital to tantalize and never satisfy his nature he was excited by his new experience but hardly happier although but three and twenty he would never know the rich vital glow with which youth rushes to clasp all forms of sensation he had seen almost daily in his father's castle excess in its most excessive development it had grown to be repulsive and he knew not how to fill the void in his life with a single spark of genius and a little more culture he might have become a passable author or artist but he was doomed to be one of those deaf and dumb natures that see the movements of the lips of others yet have no conception of sound no wonder his savage old father looked upon him with contempt for even his vices were without strength or character the dark winter days passed by one by one and the first week of lent had already arrived to subdue the glittering festivities of the court when the only genuine adventure of the season happened to the young prince for adventures in the conventional sense of the word he was not distinguished whatever came to him must come by its own force or the force of destiny one raw gloomy evening as dusk was setting in he saw a female figure in a droschky which was about turning from the great morskoi into the gorokhovaya pea street he noticed listlessly that the lady was dressed in black closely veiled and appeared to be urging the istvostchik driver to make better speed the latter cut his horse sharply it sprang forward just at the turning and the droschky striking a lamp post was instantly overturned the lady hurled with great force upon the solidly frozen snow lay motionless which the driver observing he righted the sled and drove off at full speed without looking behind him it was not inhumanity but fear of the knout that hurried him away prince boris looked up and down the morskoi but perceived no one near at hand he then knelt upon the snow lifted the lady's head to his knee and threw back her veil a face so lovely in spite of its deadly pallor he had never before seen never had he even imagined so perfect an oval such a sweet fair forehead such delicately pencilled brows so fine and straight a nose such wonderful beauty of mouth and chin it was fortunate that she was not very severely stunned for prince boris was not only ignorant of the usual modes of restoration in such cases but he totally forgot their necessity in his rapt contemplation of the lady's face presently she opened her eyes and they dwelt expressionless but bewildering in their darkness and depth upon his own while her consciousness of things slowly returned she strove to rise and boris gently lifted and supported her she would have withdrawn from his helping arm but was still too weak from the shock he also was confused and strange to say embarrassed but he had self possession enough to shout davei here at random the call was answered from the admiralty square a sled dashed up the gorokhovaya and halted beside him taking the single seat he lifted her gently upon his lap and held her very tenderly in his arms where asked the istvostchik boris was about to answer anywhere but the lady whispered in a voice of silver sweetness the name of a remote street near the smolnoi church as the prince wrapped the ends of his sable pelisse about her he noticed that her furs were of the common foxskin worn by the middle classes they with her heavy boots and the threadbare cloth of her garments by no means justified his first suspicion that she was a grande dame engaged in some romantic adventure she was not more than nineteen or twenty years of age and he felt without knowing what it was the atmosphere of sweet womanly purity and innocence which surrounded her the shyness of a lost boyhood surprised him by the time they had reached the litenie she had fully recovered her consciousness and a portion of her strength she drew away from him as much as the narrow sled would allow you have been very kind sir and i thank you she said but i am now able to go home without your further assistance by no means lady said the prince the streets are rough and here are no lamps if a second accident were to happen you would be helpless will you not allow me to protect you she looked him in the face in the dusky light she saw not the peevish weary features of the worldling but only the imploring softness of his eyes the full and perfect honesty of his present emotion she made no further objection perhaps she was glad that she could trust the elegant stranger boris never before at a loss for words even in the presence of the empress was astonished to find how awkward were his attempts at conversation she was presently the more self possessed of the two and nothing was ever so sweet to his ears as the few commonplace remarks she uttered in spite of the darkness and the chilly air the sled seemed to fly like lightning before he supposed they had made half the way she gave a sign to the istvostchik and they drew up before a plain house of squared logs the two lower windows were lighted and the dark figure of an old man with a skull cap upon his head was framed in one of them it vanished as the sled stopped the door was thrown open and the man came forth hurriedly followed by a russian nurse with a lantern helena my child art thou come at last what has befallen thee he would evidently have said more but the sight of prince boris caused him to pause while a quick shade of suspicion and alarm passed over his face the prince stepped forward instantly relieved of his unaccustomed timidity and rapidly described the accident the old nurse katinka had meanwhile assisted the lovely helena into the house the old man turned to follow shivering in the night air suddenly recollecting himself he begged the prince to enter and take some refreshments but with the air and tone of a man who hopes that his invitation will not be accepted if such was really his hope he was disappointed for boris instantly commanded the istvostchik to wait for him and entered the humble dwelling the apartment into which he was ushered was spacious and plainly yet not shabbily furnished a violoncello and clavichord with several portfolios of music and scattered sheets of ruled paper proclaimed the profession or the taste of the occupant having excused himself a moment to look after his daughter's condition the old man on his return found boris turning over the leaves of a musical work you see my profession he said i teach music do you not compose asked the prince that was once my ambition i was a pupil of sebastian bach but circumstances necessity brought me here other lives changed the direction of mine it was right you mean your daughter's the prince gently suggested hers and her mother's our story was well known in st petersburg twenty years ago but i suppose no one recollects it now my wife was the daughter of a baron von plauen and loved music and myself better than her home and a titled bridegroom she escaped we united our lives suffered and were happy together and she died that is all further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of helena with steaming glasses of tea she was even lovelier than before her close fitting dress revealed the symmetry of her form and the quiet unstudied grace of her movements although her garments were of well worn material the lace which covered her bosom was genuine point d'alencon of an old and rare pattern boris felt that her air and manner were thoroughly noble he rose and saluted her with the profoundest respect in spite of the singular delight which her presence occasioned him he was careful not to prolong his visit beyond the limits of strict etiquette his name boris alexeivitch only revealed to his guests the name of his father without his rank and when he stated that he was employed in one of the departments which was true in a measure for he was a staff officer they could only look upon him as being at best a member of some family whose recent elevation to the nobility did not release them from the necessity of government service of course he employed the usual pretext of wishing to study music and either by that or some other stratagem managed to leave matters in such a shape that a second visit could not occasion surprise as the sled glided homewards over the crackling snow he was obliged to confess the existence of a new and powerful excitement was it the chance of an adventure such as certain of his comrades were continually seeking he thought not no decidedly not was it could it be love he really could not tell he had not the slightset idea what love was like vi it was something at least that the plastic and not un virtuous nature of the young man was directed towards a definite object the elements out of which he was made although somewhat diluted were active enough to make him uncomfortable so long as they remained in a confused state he had very little power of introversion but he was sensible that his temperament was changing that he grew more cheerful and contented with life that a chasm somewhere was filling up just in proportion as his acquaintance with the old music master and his daughter became more familiar his visits were made so brief were so adroitly timed and accounted for by circumstances that by the close of lent he could feel justified in making the easter call of a friend and claim its attendant privileges without fear of being repulsed that easter call was an era in his life at the risk of his wealth and rank being suspected he dressed himself in new and rich garments and hurried away towards the smolnoi the old nurse katinka in her scarlet gown opened the door for him and was the first to say christ is arisen what could he do but give her the usual kiss formerly he had kissed hundreds of serfs men and women on the sacred anniversary with a passive good will but katinka's kiss seemed bitter and he secretly rubbed his mouth after it the music master came next grisly though he might be he was the st peter who stood at the gate of heaven then entered helena in white like an angel he took her hand pronounced the easter greeting and scarcely waited for the answer truly he has arisen before his lips found the way to hers for a second they warmly trembled and glowed together and in another second some new and sweet and subtle relation seemed to be established between their natures that night prince boris wrote a long letter to his chere maman in piquantly misspelt french giving her the gossip of the court and such family news as she usually craved the purport of the letter however was only disclosed in the final paragraph and then in so negative a way that it is doubtful whether the princess martha fully understood it poing de mariajes pour moix he wrote but we will drop the original i don't think of such a thing yet pashkoff dropped a hint the other day but i kept my eyes shut perhaps you remember her fat thick lips and crooked teeth natalie d said to me have you ever been in love prince have i maman i did not know what answer to make what is love how does one feel when one has it they laugh at it here and of course i should not wish to do what is laughable give me a hint forewarned is forearmed you know etc etc perhaps the princess martha did suspect something perhaps some word in her son's letter touched a secret spot far back in her memory and renewed a dim if not very intelligible pain she answered his question at length in the style of the popular french romances of that day she had much to say of dew and roses turtledoves and the arrows of cupid ask thyself she wrote whether felicity comes with her presence and distraction with her absence whether her eyes make the morning brighter for thee and her tears fall upon thy heart like molten lava whether heaven would be black and dismal without her company and the flames of hell turn into roses under her feet it was very evident that the good princess martha had never felt nay did not comprehend a passion such as she described prince boris however whose veneration for his mother was unbounded took her words literally and applied the questions to himself although he found it difficult in good faith and sincerity to answer all of them affirmatively he was puzzled for instance to know the sensation of molten lava falling upon the heart yet the general conclusion was inevitable helena was necessary to his happiness instead of returning to kinesma for the summer as had been arranged he determined to remain in st petersburg under the pretence of devoting himself to military studies this change of plan occasioned more disappointment to the princess martha than vexation to prince alexis the latter only growled at the prospect of being called upon to advance a further supply of rubles slightly comforting himself with the muttered reflection perhaps the brat will make a man of himself after all it was not many weeks in fact before the expected petition came to hand the princess martha had also foreseen it and instructed her son how to attack his father's weak side the latter was furiously jealous of certain other noblemen of nearly equal wealth who were with him at the court of peter the great as their sons now were at that of elizabeth boris compared the splendor of these young noblemen with his own moderate estate fabled a few adventures and drinking bouts and announced his determination of doing honor to the name which prince alexis of kinesma had left behind him in the capital there was cursing at the castle when the letter arrived many serfs felt the sting of the short whip the slumber flag was hoisted five minutes later than usual and the consumption of cognac was alarming but no mirror was smashed and when prince alexis read the letter to his poor relations he even chuckled over some portions of it boris had boldly demanded twenty thousand rubles in the desperate hope of receiving half that amount and he had calculated correctly before midsummer he was helena's accepted lover not however until then when her father had given his consent to their marriage in the autumn did he disclose his true rank the old man's face lighted up with a glow of selfish satisfaction but helena quietly took her lover's hand and said whatever you are boris i will be faithful to you vii leaving boris to discover the exact form and substance of the passion of love we will return for a time to the castle of kinesma whether the princess martha conjectured what had transpired in st petersburg or was partially informed of it by her son cannot now be ascertained she was sufficiently weak timid and nervous to be troubled with the knowledge of the stratagem in which she had assisted in order to procure money and that the ever present consciousness thereof would betray itself to the sharp eyes of her husband certain it is that the demeanor of the latter towards her and his household began to change about the end of the summer he seemed to have a haunting suspicion that in some way he had been or was about to be overreached he grew peevish suspicious and more violent than ever in his excesses when mishka the dissipated bear already described bit off one of the ears of basil a hunter belonging to the castle and basil drew his knife and plunged it into mishka's heart prince alexis punished the hunter by cutting off his other ear and sending him away to a distant estate a serf detected in eating a few of the pickled cherries intended for the prince's botvinia was placed in a cask and pickled cherries packed around him up to the chin there he was kept until almost flayed by the acid it was ordered that these two delinquents should never afterwards be called by any other names than crop ear and cherry but the prince's severest joke which strange to say in no wise lessened his popularity among the serfs occurred a month or two later one of his leading passions was the chase especially the chase in his own forests with from one to two hundred men and no one to dispute his lordship on such occasions a huge barrel of wine mounted upon a sled always accompanied the crowd and the quantity which the hunters received depended upon the satisfaction of prince alexis with the game they collected winter had set in early and suddenly and one day as the prince and his retainers emerged from the forest with their forenoon's spoil and found themselves on the bank of the volga the water was already covered with a thin sheet of ice fires were kindled a score or two of hares and a brace of deer were skinned and the flesh placed on sticks to broil skins of mead foamed and hissed into the wooden bowls and the cask of unbroached wine towered in the midst prince alexis had a good appetite the meal was after his heart and by the time he had eaten a hare and half a flank of venison followed by several bowls of fiery wine he was in the humor for sport he ordered a hole cut in the upper side of the barrel as it lay then getting astride of it like a grisly bacchus he dipped out the liquor with a ladle and plied his thirsty serfs until they became as recklessly savage as he they were scattered over a slope gently falling from the dark dense fir forest towards the volga where it terminated in a rocky palisade ten to fifteen feet in height the fires blazed and crackled merrily in the frosty air the yells and songs of the carousers were echoed back from the opposite shore of the river the chill atmosphere the lowering sky and the approaching night could not touch the blood of that wild crowd their faces glowed and their eyes sparkled they were ready for any deviltry which their lord might suggest some began to amuse themselves by flinging the clean picked bones of deer and hare along the glassy ice of the volga prince alexis perceiving this diverson cried out in ecstasy oh by st nicholas the miracle worker i'll give you better sport than that ye knaves here's the very place for a reisak do you hear me children a reisak could there be better ice and then the rocks to jump from come children come waska ivan daniel you dogs over with you now the reisak was a gymnastic performance peculiar to old russia and therefore needs to be described it could become popular only among a people of strong physical qualities and in a country where swift rivers freeze rapidly from sudden cold hence we are of the opinion that it will not be introduced into our own winter diversions a spot is selected where the water is deep and the current tolerably strong the ice must be about half an inch in thickness the performer leaps head foremost from a rock or platform bursts through the ice is carried under by the current comes up some distance below and bursts through again both skill and strength are required to do the feat successfully waska ivan daniel and a number of others sprang to the brink of the rocks and looked over the wall was not quite perpendicular some large fragments having fallen from above and lodged along the base it would therefore require a bold leap to clear the rocks and strike the smooth ice they hesitated and no wonder prince alexis howled with rage and disappointment the devil take you for a pack of whimpering hounds he cried holy saints they are afraid to make a reisak ivan crossed himself and sprang he cleared the rocks but instead of bursting through the ice with his head fell at full length upon his back o knave yelled the prince not to know where his head is thinks it's his back give him fifteen stripes which was instantly done the second attempt was partially successful one of the hunters broke through the ice head foremost going down but he failed to come up again so the feat was only half performed the prince became more furiously excited this is the way i'm treated he cried he forgets all about finishing the reisak and goes to chasing sterlet may the carps eat him up for an ungrateful vagabond here you beggars addressing the poor relations take your turn and let me see whether you are men only one of the frightened parasites had the courage to obey on reaching the brink he shut his eyes in mortal fear and made a leap at random the next moment he lay on the edge of the ice with one leg broken against a fragment of"
