"1" "if you let hank out'n that cistern before he has signed the pledge and promised to jine the church you're a bigger fool n i take you to be a woman has got to make a stand with that she marches out'n our house then all the women sings out send fur brother cartwright send fur brother cartwright and they sent me scooting acrost town to get him quick which he was the preacher of the baptist church and lived next to it and i hadn't got no lamming yet chapter ii i never stopped to tell but two three folks on the way to brother cartwright's but they must of spread it quick cause when i got back home with him it seemed like the hull town was there it was along about dusk by this time and it was a prayer meeting night at the church mr cartwright told his wife to tell the folks what come to the prayer meeting he'd be back before long and to wait fur him which she really told them where he had went and what fur mr cartwright marches right into the kitchen all the chairs in our house was into the kitchen and the women was a talking and a laughing and they had sent over to alexanderses for their chairs and to rogerses for theirn every oncet in a while they would be a awful bust of language come up from that hole where that unreginerate old sinner was cooped up in i have travelled around considerable since them days and i have mixed up along of many kinds of people in many different places and some of em was cussers to admire but i never hearn such cussing before or since as old hank done that night he busted his own records and riz higher'n his own water marks for previous times i wasn't nothing but a little kid then and skeercly fitten fur to admire the full beauty of it they was deep down cusses that come from the heart looking back at it after all these years i can believe what brother cartwright said himself that night that it wasn't natcheral cussing and some higher power like a demon or a evil sperrit must of entered into hank's human carkis and give that turrible eloquence to his remarks it busted out every few minutes and the women would put their fingers into their ears till a spell was over and it was personal too hank he would listen until he hearn a woman's voice that he knowed and then he would let loose on her fambly going backwards to her grandfathers and downwards to her children's children if her father had once stolen a hog or her husband done any disgrace that got found out on him hank would put it all into his gineral remarks with trimmings onto it brother cartwright he steps up to the hole in the floor when he first comes in and he says gentle like and soothing like a undertaker when he tells you where to set at a home funeral brother walters brother hank yells out don't ye brother me you sniffling psalm singing yaller faced pigeon toed hippercrit you get me a ladder gol dern you and i'll come out'n here and learn you to brother me i will only that wasn't nothing to what hank really said to that preacher no more like it than a little yaller fluffy canary is like a buzzard brother walters says the preacher ca'am but firm we have all decided that you ain't going to come out of that cistern till you sign the pledge and hank tells him what he thinks of pledges and him and church doings and it wasn't purty and he says if he was as deep in eternal fire as what he now is in rain water and every fish that nibbles at his toes was a preacher with a red hot pitchfork a jabbing at him they could jab till the hull hereafter turned into snow afore he'd ever sign nothing a man like mr cartwright give him to sign hank was stubborner than any mule he ever nailed shoes onto and proud of being that stubborn that town was a awful religious town and hank he knowed he was called the most onreligious man in it and he was proud of that too and if any one called him a heathen it jest plumb tickled him all over brother walters says that preacher we are going to pray for you and they done it they brought all them chairs close up around that cistern in a ring and they all kneeled down there with their heads on em and they prayed fur hank's salvation they done it up in style too one at a time and the others singing out amen every now and then and they shed tears down onto hank the front yard was crowded with men all a laughing and a talking and chawing and spitting tobacco and betting how long hank would hold out old si emery that was the city marshal and always wore a big nickel plated star was out there with em si was in a sweat cause bill nolan that run the bar room and some more of hank's friends or as near friends as he had was out in the road they says to si he must arrest that preacher fur hank is being gradual murdered in that there water and he'll die if he's helt there too long and it will be a crime only they didn't come into the yard to say it amongst us religious folks but si he says he dassent arrest no one because it is outside the town copperation but he's considerable worried too about what his duty orter be pretty soon the gang that mrs cartwright has rounded up at the prayer meeting comes stringing along in they had all brung their hymn books with them and they sung the hull town was there then and they all sung and they sung revival hymns over hank and hank he would jest cuss and cuss every time he busted out into another cussing spell they would start another hymn finally the men out in the front yard got warmed up too and begun to sing all but bill nolan's crowd and they give hank up for lost and went away disgusted the first thing you knowed they was a reg'lar revival meeting there and that preacher was preaching a reg'lar revival sermon i been to more'n one camp meeting but fur jest natcherally taking holt of the hull human race by the slack of its pants and dangling of it over hell fire i never hearn nothing could come up to that there sermon two or three old backsliders in the crowd come right up and repented all over agin on the spot the hull kit and biling of em got the power good and hard like they does at camp meetings and revivals but hank he only cussed he was obstinate hank was and his pride and dander had riz up finally he says you're taking a ornery low down advantage o me you are let me out'n this here cistern and i'll show you who'll stick it out longest on dry land dern your religious hides some of the folks there hadn't had no suppers so after all the other sinners but hank had either got converted or else sneaked away some of the women says why not make a kind of love feast out of it and bring some vittles like they does to church sociables because it seems likely satan is going to wrastle all night long like he done with the angel jacob and they ought to be prepared so they done it they went and they come back with vittles and they made up hot coffee and they feasted that preacher and theirselves and elmira and me all right in hank's hearing and hank was getting hungry himself and he was cold in that water and the fish was nibbling at him and he was getting cussed out and weak and soaked full of despair and they wasn't no way fur him to set down and rest and he was scared of getting a cramp in his legs and sinking down with his head under water and being drownded he said afterward he'd of done the last with pleasure if they was any way of suing that crowd fur murder so along about ten o'clock he sings out i give in gosh dern ye i give in let me out and i'll sign your pesky pledge brother cartwright was fur getting a ladder and letting him climb out right away but elmira she says don't you do it brother cartwright don't you do it you don't know hank walters like i does if he oncet gets out o there before he's signed that pledge he won't never sign it so they fixed it up that brother cartwright was to write out a pledge on the inside leaf of the bible and tie the bible onto a string and a lead pencil onto another string and let the strings down to hank and he was to make his mark fur he couldn't write and they was to be pulled up agin hank he says all right and they done it but jest as hank was making his mark on the leaf of the book that preacher done what i has always thought was a mean trick he was lying on the floor with his head and shoulders into that hole as fur as he could holding a lantern way down into it so as hank could see and jest as hank made that mark he spoke some words over him and then he says now henry walters i have baptized you and you are a member of the church you'd a thought hank would of broke out cussing agin at being took unexpected that a way fur he hadn't really agreed to nothing but signing the pledge but nary a cuss he jest says now you get that ladder they got it and he clumb up into the kitchen dripping and shivering you went and baptized me in that water he asts the preacher the preacher says he has then says hank you done a low down trick on me you knowed i has made my brags i never jined no church nor never would jine you knowed i was proud of that you knowed that it was my glory to tell of it and that i set a heap of store by it in every way and now you've went and took it away from me you never fought it out fair and square neither man playing to outlast man like you done with this here pledge but you sneaked it in on me when i wasn't looking they was a lot of men in that crowd that thought the preacher had went too far and sympathized with hank the way he done about that hurt brother cartwright in our town and they was a split in the church because some said it wasn't reg'lar and wasn't binding he lost his job after a while and become an evangelist which it don't make no difference what one of them does nohow but hank he always thought he had been baptized reg'lar and he never was the same afterward he had made his life long brags and his pride was broke in that there one pertic'ler spot and he sorrered and grieved over it a good eal and got grouchier and grouchier and meaner and meaner and lickered oftener if anything signing the pledge couldn't hold hank he was worse in every way after that night in the cistern and took to lamming me harder and harder chapter iii well all the lammings hank laid on never done me any good it seemed like i was jest natcherally cut out to have no success in life and no amount of whaling could change it though hank he was faithful before i was twelve years old the hull town had seen it and they wasn't nothing else expected of me except not to be any good that had its handy sides to it too they was lots of kids there that had to go to school but hank he never would of let me done that if i had ast him and i never asted and they was lots of kids considerably bothered all the time with their parents and relations they made em go to sunday school and wash up reg'lar all over on saturday nights and put on shoes and stockings part of the time even in the summer and some of em had to ast to go in swimming and the hull thing was a continuous trouble and privation to em but they wasn't nothing perdicted of me and i done like it was perdicted everybody lowed from the start that hank would of made trash out'n me even if i hadn't showed all the signs of being trash anyhow and if they was devilment anywhere about that town they all says danny he done it and like as not i has so i gets to be what you might call an outcast all the kids whose folks ain't trash their mothers tells em not to run with me no more which they done it all the more fur that reason on the sly and it makes me more important with them but when i gets a little bigger all that makes me feel kind o bad sometimes it ain't so handy then fur folks gets to saying when i would come around danny what do you want and if i says nothing they would say well then you get out o here which they needn't of been suspicioning nothing like they pertended they did fur i never stole nothing more'n worter millions and mush millions and such truck and mebby now and then a chicken us kids use to roast in the woods on sundays and jest as like as not it was one of hank's hens then which i figgered i'd earnt it fur hank he had streaks when he'd work me considerable hard he never give me any money fur it he loafed a lot too and when he'd loaf i'd loaf but i did pick up right smart of handiness with tools around that there shop of his'n and if he'd ever of used me right i might of turned into a purty fair blacksmith but it wasn't no use trying to work fur hank when i was about fifteen times is right bad around the house fur a spell and elmira is working purty hard and i thinks to myself well these folks has kind o brung you up and you ain't never done more'n hank made you do mebby you orter stick to work a little more when they's a job in the shop even if hank don't which i tried it fur about two or three years doing as much work around the shop as hank done and mebby more but it wasn't no use one day when i'm about eighteen i seen awful plain i'll have to light out from there they was a circus come to town that day i says to hank hank they is a circus this afternoon and agin to night so i has hearn says hank are you going to it says i i mout says hank and then agin i moutn't i don't see as it's no consarns of yourn nohow i knowed he was going though hank he never missed a circus well i says they wasn't no harm to ast was they well you've asted ain't you says hank well then says i i'd like to go to that there circus myself they ain't no use in me saying fur you not to go says hank fur you would go anyhow you always does go off when you is needed but i ain't got no money i says and i was going to ast you could you spare me half a dollar great jehosephat says hank but ain't you getting stuck up what's the matter of you crawling in under the tent like you always done first thing i know you'll be wanting a pair of these here yaller shoes and a stove pipe hat no says i i ain't no dude hank and you know it but they is always things about a circus to spend money on besides jest the circus herself they is the side show fur instance and they is the grand concert afterward i calkelated i'd take em all in this year the hull dern thing jest fur oncet hank he looks at me like i'd asted fur a house n lot or a million dollars or something like that but he don't say nothing he jest snorts hank i says i been doing right smart work around the shop fur two three years now if you wasn't loafing so much you'd a noticed it more and i ain't never ast fur a cent of pay fur it nor you ain't wuth no pay says hank you ain't wuth nothing but to eat vittles and wear out clothes well i says i figger i earn my vittles and a good eal more and as fur as clothes goes i never had none but what elmira made out'n yourn who brung you up asts hank you done it says i and by your own say so you done a dern poor job at it you go to that there circus says hank a flaring up and i'll lambaste you up to a inch of your life so fur as handing out money fur you to sling it to the dogs i ain't no bank and if i was i ain't no ijut but you jest let me hear of you even going nigh that circus lot and all the lammings you has ever got rolled into one won't be a measly little sarcumstance to what you will get they ain't no leather faced young upstart with weepin willow hair going to throw up to me how i brung him up that's gratitood fur you that is says hank if it hadn't of been fur me giving you a home when i found you first where would you of been now well i says i might of been a good eal better off if you hadn't of took me in the alexanderses would of and then i wouldn't of been kep out of school and growed up a ignoramus like you is i never had no trouble keeping you away from school i notice says hank with a snort this is the first i ever hearn of you wanting to go there which was true in one way and a lie in another i hadn't never wanted to go till lately but he'd of lammed me if i had of wanted to he always said he would and now i was too big and knowed it well hank he never give me no money so i watches my chancet that afternoon and slips in under the tent the same as always and i lays low under them green benches and wiggled through when i seen a good chancet the first person i seen was hank of course he seen me and he shook his fist at me in a promising kind of way and they wasn't no trouble figgering out what he meant fur a while i didn't enjoy that circus to no extent fur i was thinking that if hank tries to lick me fur it i'll fight him back this time which i hadn't never fit him back much yet fur fear he'd pick up something iron around the shop and jest natcherally lay me cold with it i got home before hank did it was nigh sundown and i was waiting in the door of the shop fur elmira to holler vittles is ready and hank come along he didn't waste no time he steps inside the shop and he takes down a strap and he says you come here and take off your shirt but i jest moves away hank he runs in on me and he swings his strap i throwed up my arm and it cut me acrost the knuckles i run in on him and he dropped the strap and fetched me an openhanded smack plumb on the mouth that jarred my head back and like to of busted it loose then i got right mad and i run in on him agin and this time i got to him and wrastled with him well sir i never was so surprised in all my life before fur i hadn't had holt on him more'n a minute before i seen i'm stronger than hank is i throwed him and he hit the ground with considerable of a jar and then i put my knee in the pit of his stomach and churned it a couple and i thinks to myself what a fool i must of been fur better'n a year because i might of done this any time i got him by the ears and i slammed his head into the gravel a few times him a reaching fur my throat and a pounding me with his fists but me a taking the licks and keeping holt and i had a mighty contented time fur a few minutes there on top of hank chuckling to myself and batting him one every now and then fur luck and trying to make him holler it's enough but hank is stubborn and he won't holler and purty soon i thinks what am i going to do fur hank will be so mad when i let him up he'll jest natcherally kill me without i kill him and i was scared because i don't want neither one of them things to happen whilst i was thinking it over and getting scareder and scareder and banging hank's head harder and harder some one grabs me from behind they was two of them and one gets my collar and one gets the seat of my pants and they drug me off'n him hank he gets up and then he sets down sudden on a horse block and wipes his face on his sleeve which they was considerable blood come onto the sleeve i looks around to see who has had holt of me and it is two men one of them looks about seven feet tall on account of a big plug hat and a long white linen duster and has a beautiful red beard in the road they is a big stout road wagon with a canopy top over it pulled by two hosses and on the wagon box they is a strip of canvas which i couldn't read then what was wrote on the canvas but i learnt later it said in big print siwash indian sagraw nature's universal medicinal specific discovered by dr hartley l kirby among the aborigines of oregon on account of being so busy neither hank nor me had hearn the wagon come along the road and stop the big man in the plug hat he says or they was words to that effect jest as serious why are you mauling the aged gent well says i he needed it considerable but says he still more solemn the good book says to honour thy father and thy mother well i says mebby it does and mebby it don't but he ain't my father nohow and he ain't been getting no more'n his come uppings vengeance is mine saith the lord the big man remarks very serious hank he riz up then and he says mister be you a preacher cause if you be the sooner you have druv on the better fur ye i got a grudge agin all preachers that feller he jest looks hank over ca'am and easy and slow before he answers and he wrinkles up his face like he never seen anything like hank before then he fetches a kind o aggervating smile and he says beneath a shady chestnut tree the village blacksmith stands the smith a pleasant soul is he with warts upon his hands he stares at hank hard and solemn and serious while he is saying that poetry at him hank fidgets and turns his eyes away but the feller touches him on the breast with his finger and makes him look at him my honest friend says the feller i am not a preacher not right now anyhow no my mission is spreading the glad tidings of good health look at me and he swells his chest up and keeps a holt of hank's eyes with his'n you behold before you the discoverer manufacturer and proprietor of siwash indian sagraw nature's own remedy for bright's disease rheumatism liver and kidney trouble catarrh consumption bronchitis ring worm erysipelas lung fever typhoid croup dandruff stomach trouble dyspepsia and they was a lot more of em well says hank sort o backing up as the big man come nearer and nearer to him jest natcherally bully ragging him with them eyes i got none of them there complaints the doctor he kind o snarls and he brings his hand down hard on hank's shoulder and he says there are more things betwixt dan and beersheba than was ever dreamt of in thy sagacity romeo or they was words to that effect fur that doctor was jest plumb full of scripter quotations and he sings out sudden giving hank a shove that nearly pushes him over man alive he yells you don't know what disease you may have many's the strong man i've seen rejoicing in his strength at the dawn of day cut down like the grass in the field before sunset he says hank he's trying to look the other way but that doctor won't let his eyes wiggle away from his'n he says very sharp stick out your tongue hank he sticks her out the doctor he takes some glasses out'n his pocket and puts em on and he fetches a long look at her then he opens his mouth like he was going to say something and shuts it agin like his feelings won't let him he puts his arm across hank's shoulder affectionate and sad and then he turns his head away like they was some one dead in the fambly finally he says i thought so i saw it i saw it in your eyes when i first drove up i hope he says very mournful i haven't come too late hank he turns pale i was getting sorry fur hank myself i seen now why i licked him so easy any one could of told from that doctor's actions hank was as good as a dead man already but hank he makes a big effort and he says shucks i'm sixty eight years old doctor and i hain't never had a sick day in my life but he was awful uneasy too the doctor he says to the feller with him looey bring me one of the sample size looey brung it the doctor never taking his eyes off'n hank he handed it to hank and he says a whiskey glass full three times a day my friend and there is a good chance for even you i give it to you without money and without price but what have i got asts hank you have spinal meningitis says the doctor never batting an eye will this here cure me says hank it'll cure anything says the doctor hank he says shucks agin but he took the bottle and pulled the cork out and smelt it right thoughtful and what them fellers had stopped at our place fur was to have the shoe of the nigh

front of smith's palace hotel they was jest starting up when i got there well sir that doctor was a sight he didn't have his duster onto him but his stove pipe hat was and one of them long prince

as uncle pat hickey's wen what was one of the town sights no sir they never was a man with more genuine fashionableness sticking out all over him than doctor kirby he jest fairly wallered in it i hadn't paid no pertic'ler attention to the other feller with him when they stopped at our place excepting to notice he was kind of slim and blackhaired and funny complected but i seen now i orter of
