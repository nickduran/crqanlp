"1" "and i loved to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas he related his fishing and his combats with natural poetry of expression his recital took the form of an epic poem and i seemed to be listening to a canadian homer singing the iliad of the regions of the north i am portraying this hardy companion as i really knew him we are old friends now united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and cemented amidst extreme dangers ah brave ned i ask no more than to live a hundred years longer that i may have more time to dwell the longer on your memory now what was ned land's opinion upon the question of the marine monster i must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn and was the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction he even avoided the subject which i one day thought it my duty to press upon him one magnificent evening the 30th july that is to say three weeks after our departure the frigate was abreast of cape blanc thirty miles to leeward of the coast of patagonia we had crossed the tropic of capricorn and the straits of magellan opened less than seven hundred miles to the south before eight days were over the abraham lincoln would be ploughing the waters of the pacific seated on the poop ned land and i were chatting of one thing and another as we looked at this mysterious sea whose great depths had up to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man i naturally led up the conversation to the giant unicorn and examined the various chances of success or failure of the expedition but seeing that ned land let me speak without saying too much himself i pressed him more closely well ned said i is it possible that you are not convinced of the existence of this cetacean that we are following have you any particular reason for being so incredulous the harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering struck his broad forehead with his hand a habit of his as if to collect himself and said at last perhaps i have mr aronnax but ned you a whaler by profession familiarised with all the great marine mammalia you ought to be the last to doubt under such circumstances that is just what deceives you professor replied ned as a whaler i have followed many a cetacean harpooned a great number and killed several but however strong or well armed they may have been neither their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer but ned they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have pierced through and through wooden ships that is possible replied the canadian but i have never seen it done and until further proof i deny that whales cetaceans or sea unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe well ned i repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of facts i believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised belonging to the branch of vertebrata like the whales the cachalots or the dolphins and furnished with a horn of defence of great penetrating power hum said the harpooner shaking his head with the air of a man who would not be convinced notice one thing my worthy canadian i resumed if such an animal is in existence if it inhabits the depths of the ocean if it frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water it must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would defy all comparison and why this powerful organisation demanded ned because it requires incalculable strength to keep one's self in these strata and resist their pressure listen to me let us admit that the pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of water thirty two feet high in reality the column of water would be shorter as we are speaking of sea water the density of which is greater than that of fresh water very well when you dive ned as many times 32 feet of water as there are above you so many times does your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere that is to say 15 lb for each square inch of its surface it follows then that at 320 feet this pressure equals that of 10 atmospheres of 100 atmospheres at 3,200 feet and of 1,000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet that is about 6 miles which is equivalent to saying that if you could attain this depth in the ocean each square three eighths of an inch of the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5,600 lb ah my brave ned do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface of your body i have no idea mr aronnax about 6,500 and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15 lb to the square inch your 6,500 square inches bear at this moment a pressure of 97,500 lb without my perceiving it without your perceiving it and if you are not crushed by such a pressure it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body with equal pressure hence perfect equilibrium between the interior and exterior pressure which thus neutralise each other and which allows you to bear it without inconvenience but in the water it is another thing yes i understand replied ned becoming more attentive because the water surrounds me but does not penetrate precisely ned so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you would undergo a pressure of 97,500 lb at 320 feet ten times that pressure at 3,200 feet a hundred times that pressure lastly at 32,000 feet a thousand times that pressure would be 97,500,000 lb that is to say that you would be flattened as if you had been drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine the devil exclaimed ned very well my worthy harpooner if some vertebrate several hundred yards long and large in proportion can maintain itself in such depths of those whose surface is represented by millions of square inches that is by tens of millions of pounds we must estimate the pressure they undergo consider then what must be the resistance of their bony structure and the strength of their organisation to withstand such pressure why exclaimed ned land they must be made of iron plates eight inches thick like the armoured frigates as you say ned and think what destruction such a mass would cause if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a vessel yes certainly perhaps replied the canadian shaken by these figures but not yet willing to give in well have i convinced you you have convinced me of one thing sir which is that if such animals do exist at the bottom of the seas they must necessarily be as strong as you say but if they do not exist mine obstinate harpooner how explain the accident to the scotia chapter v at a venture the voyage of the abraham lincoln was for a long time marked by no special incident but one circumstance happened which showed the wonderful dexterity of ned land and proved what confidence we might place in him the 30th of june the frigate spoke some american whalers from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal but one of them the captain of the monroe knowing that ned land had shipped on board the abraham lincoln begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in sight commander farragut desirous of seeing ned land at work gave him permission to go on board the monroe and fate served our canadian so well that instead of one whale he harpooned two with a double blow striking one straight to the heart and catching the other after some minutes pursuit decidedly if the monster ever had to do with ned land's harpoon i would not bet in its favour the frigate skirted the south east coast of america with great rapidity the 3rd of july we were at the opening of the straits of magellan level with cape vierges but commander farragut would not take a tortuous passage but doubled cape horn the ship's crew agreed with him and certainly it was possible that they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass many of the sailors affirmed that the monster could not pass there that he was too big for that the 6th of july about three o'clock in the afternoon the abraham lincoln at fifteen miles to the south doubled the solitary island this lost rock at the extremity of the american continent to which some dutch sailors gave the name of their native town cape horn the course was taken towards the north west and the next day the screw of the frigate was at last beating the waters of the pacific keep your eyes open called out the sailors and they were opened widely both eyes and glasses a little dazzled it is true by the prospect of two thousand dollars had not an instant's repose i myself for whom money had no charms was not the least attentive on board giving but few minutes to my meals but a few hours to sleep indifferent to either rain or sunshine i did not leave the poop of the vessel now leaning on the netting of the forecastle now on the taffrail i devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the sea as far as the eye could reach and how often have i shared the emotion of the majority of the crew when some capricious whale raised its black back above the waves the poop of the vessel was crowded on a moment the cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the cetacean i looked and looked till i was nearly blind whilst conseil kept repeating in a calm voice if sir you would not squint so much you would see better but vain excitement the abraham lincoln checked its speed and made for the animal signalled a simple whale or common cachalot which soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse but the weather was good the voyage was being accomplished under the most favourable auspices it was then the bad season in australia the july of that zone corresponding to our january in europe but the sea was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference the 20th of july the tropic of capricorn was cut by 105d of longitude and the 27th of the same month we crossed the equator on the 110th meridian this passed the frigate took a more decided westerly direction and scoured the central waters of the pacific commander farragut thought and with reason that it was better to remain in deep water and keep clear of continents or islands which the beast itself seemed to shun perhaps because there was not enough water for him suggested the greater part of the crew the frigate passed at some distance from the marquesas and the sandwich islands crossed the tropic of cancer and made for the china seas we were on the theatre of the last diversions of the monster and to say truth we no longer lived on board the entire ship's crew were undergoing a nervous excitement of which i can give no idea they could not eat they could not sleep twenty times a day a misconception or an optical illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail would cause dreadful perspirations and these emotions twenty times repeated kept us in a state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable and truly reaction soon showed itself for three months during which a day seemed an age the abraham lincoln furrowed all the waters of the northern pacific running at whales making sharp deviations from her course veering suddenly from one tack to another stopping suddenly putting on steam and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging her machinery and not one point of the japanese or american coast was left unexplored the warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent detractors reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself and certainly had it not been for the resolute determination on the part of captain farragut the frigate would have headed due southward this useless search could not last much longer the abraham lincoln had nothing to reproach herself with she had done her best to succeed never had an american ship's crew shown more zeal or patience its failure could not be placed to their charge there remained nothing but to return this was represented to the commander the sailors could not hide their discontent and the service suffered i will not say there was a mutiny on board but after a reasonable period of obstinacy captain farragut as columbus did asked for three days patience if in three days the monster did not appear the man at the helm should give three turns of the wheel and the abraham lincoln would make for the european seas this promise was made on the 2nd of november it had the effect of rallying the ship's crew the ocean was watched with renewed attention each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his remembrance glasses were used with feverish activity it was a grand defiance given to the giant narwhal and he could scarcely fail to answer the summons and appear two days passed the steam was at half pressure a thousand schemes were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the animal in case it should be met in those parts large quantities of bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship to the great satisfaction i must say of the sharks small craft radiated in all directions round the abraham lincoln as she lay to and did not leave a spot of the sea unexplored but the night of the 4th of november arrived without the unveiling of this submarine mystery the next day the 5th of november at twelve the delay would morally speaking expire after that time commander farragut faithful to his promise was to turn the course to the south east and abandon for ever the northern regions of the pacific the frigate was then in 31 deg 15 n lat and 136 deg 42 e long the coast of japan still remained less than two hundred miles to leeward night was approaching they had just struck eight bells large clouds veiled the face of the moon then in its first quarter the sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel at that moment i was leaning forward on the starboard netting conseil standing near me was looking straight before him the crew perched in the ratlines examined the horizon which contracted and darkened by degrees officers with their night glasses scoured the growing darkness sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the moon which darted between two clouds then all trace of light was lost in the darkness in looking at conseil i could see he was undergoing a little of the general influence at least i thought so perhaps for the first time his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity come conseil said i this is the last chance of pocketing the two thousand dollars may i be permitted to say sir replied conseil that i never reckoned on getting the prize and had the government of the union offered a hundred thousand dollars it would have been none the poorer you are right conseil it is a foolish affair after all and one upon which we entered too lightly what time lost what useless emotions we should have been back in france six months ago in your little room sir replied conseil and in your museum sir and i should have already classed all your fossils sir and the babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the jardin des plantes and have drawn all the curious people of the capital as you say conseil i fancy we shall run a fair chance of being laughed at for our pains that's tolerably certain replied conseil quietly i think they will make fun of you sir and must i say it go on my good friend well sir you will only get your deserts indeed when one has the honour of being a _savant_ as you are sir one should not expose one's self to conseil had not time to finish his compliment in the midst of general silence a voice had just been heard it was the voice of ned land shouting look out there the very thing we are looking for on our weather beam chapter vi at full steam at this cry the whole ship's crew hurried towards the harpooner commander officers masters sailors cabin boys even the engineers left their engines and the stokers their furnaces the order to stop her had been given and the frigate now simply went on by her own momentum the darkness was then profound and however good the canadian's eyes were i asked myself how he had managed to see and what he had been able to see my heart beat as if it would break but ned land was not mistaken and we all perceived the object he pointed to at two cables length from the abraham lincoln on the starboard quarter the sea seemed to be illuminated all over it was not a mere phosphoric phenomenon the monster emerged some fathoms from the water and then threw out that very intense but mysterious light mentioned in the report of several captains this magnificent irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great shining power the luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval much elongated the centre of which condensed a burning heat whose overpowering brilliancy died out by successive gradations it is only a massing of phosphoric particles cried one of the officers no sir certainly not i replied that brightness is of an essentially electrical nature besides see see it moves it is moving forwards backwards it is darting towards us a general cry arose from the frigate silence said the captain up with the helm reverse the engines the steam was shut off and the abraham lincoln beating to port described a semicircle right the helm go ahead cried the captain these orders were executed and the frigate moved rapidly from the burning light i was mistaken she tried to sheer off but the supernatural animal approached with a velocity double her own we gasped for breath stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and motionless the animal gained on us sporting with the waves it made the round of the frigate which was then making fourteen knots and enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust then it moved away two or three miles leaving a phosphorescent track like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind all at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain its momentum the monster rushed suddenly towards the abraham lincoln with alarming rapidity stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the hull and died out not diving under the water for its brilliancy did not abate but suddenly and as if the source of this brilliant emanation was exhausted then it reappeared on the other side of the vessel as if it had turned and slid under the hull any moment a collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us however i was astonished at the manoeuvres of the frigate she fled and did not attack on the captain's face generally so impassive was an expression of unaccountable astonishment mr aronnax he said i do not know with what formidable being i have to deal and i will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst of this darkness besides how attack this unknown thing how defend one's self from it wait for daylight and the scene will change you have no further doubt captain of the nature of the animal no sir it is evidently a gigantic narwhal and an electric one perhaps added i one can only approach it with a torpedo undoubtedly replied the captain if it possesses such dreadful power it is the most terrible animal that ever was created that is why sir i must be on my guard the crew were on their feet all night no one thought of sleep the abraham lincoln not being able to struggle with such velocity had moderated its pace and sailed at half speed for its part the narwhal imitating the frigate let the waves rock it at will and seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle towards midnight however it disappeared or to use a more appropriate term it died out like a large glow worm had it fled one could only fear not hope it but at seven minutes to one o'clock in the morning a deafening whistling was heard like that produced by a body of water rushing with great violence the captain ned land and i were then on the poop eagerly peering through the profound darkness ned land asked the commander you have often heard the roaring of whales often sir but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two thousand dollars if i can only approach within four harpoons length of it but to approach it said the commander i ought to put a whaler at your disposal certainly sir that will be trifling with the lives of my men and mine too simply said the harpooner towards two o'clock in the morning the burning light reappeared not less intense about five miles to windward of the abraham lincoln notwithstanding the distance and the noise of the wind and sea one heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animal's tail and even its panting breath it seemed that at the moment that the enormous narwhal had come to take breath at the surface of the water the air was engulfed in its lungs like the steam in the vast cylinders of a machine of two thousand horse power hum thought i a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment would be a pretty whale we were on the qui vive till daylight and prepared for the combat the fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings the second lieutenant loaded the blunder busses which could throw harpoons to the distance of a mile and long duck guns with explosive bullets which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals ned land contented himself with sharpening his harpoon a terrible weapon in his hands at six o'clock day began to break and with the first glimmer of light the electric light of the narwhal disappeared at seven o'clock the day was sufficiently advanced but a very thick sea fog obscured our view and the best spy glasses could not pierce it that caused disappointment and anger i climbed the mizzen mast some officers were already perched on the mast heads at eight o'clock the fog lay heavily on the waves and its thick scrolls rose little by little the horizon grew wider and clearer at the same time suddenly just as on the day before ned land's voice was heard the thing itself on the port quarter cried the harpooner every eye was turned towards the point indicated there a mile and a half from the frigate a long blackish body emerged a yard above the waves its tail violently agitated produced a considerable eddy never did a tail beat the sea with such violence an immense track of dazzling whiteness marked the passage of the animal and described a long curve the frigate approached the cetacean i examined it thoroughly the reports of the shannon and of the helvetia had rather exaggerated its size and i estimated its length at only two hundred and fifty feet as to its dimensions i could only conjecture them to be admirably proportioned while i watched this phenomenon two jets of steam and water were ejected from its vents and rose to the height of 120 feet thus i ascertained its way of breathing i concluded definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate branch class mammalia the crew waited impatiently for their chief's orders the latter after having observed the animal attentively called the engineer the engineer ran to him sir said the commander you have steam up yes sir answered the engineer well make up your fires and put on all steam three hurrahs greeted this order the time for the struggle had arrived some moments after the two funnels of the frigate vomited torrents of black smoke and the bridge quaked under the trembling of the boilers the abraham lincoln propelled by her wonderful screw went straight at the animal the latter allowed it to come within half a cable's length then as if disdaining to dive it took a little turn and stopped a short distance off this pursuit lasted nearly three quarters of an hour without the frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean it was quite evident that at that rate we should never come up with it well mr land asked the captain do you advise me to put the boats out to sea no sir replied ned land because we shall not take that beast easily what shall we do then put on more steam if you can sir with your leave i mean to post myself under the bowsprit and if we get within harpooning distance i shall throw my harpoon go ned said the captain engineer put on more pressure ned land went to his post the fires were increased the screw revolved forty three times a minute and the steam poured out of the valves we heaved the log and calculated that the abraham lincoln was going at the rate of 18 1 2 miles an hour but the accursed animal swam at the same speed for a whole hour the frigate kept up this pace without gaining six feet it was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the american navy a stubborn anger seized the crew the sailors abused the monster who as before disdained to answer them the captain no longer contented himself with twisting his beard he gnawed it the engineer was called again you have turned full steam on yes sir replied the engineer the speed of the abraham lincoln increased its masts trembled down to their stepping holes and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out of the narrow funnels they heaved the log a second time well asked the captain of the man at the wheel nineteen miles and three tenths sir clap on more steam the engineer obeyed the manometer showed ten degrees but the cetacean grew warm itself no doubt for without straining itself it made 19 3 10 miles what a pursuit no i cannot describe the emotion that vibrated through me ned land kept his post harpoon in hand several times the animal let us gain upon it we shall catch it we shall catch it cried the canadian but just as he was going to strike the cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less than thirty miles an hour and even during our maximum of speed it bullied the frigate going round and round it a cry of fury broke from everyone at noon we were no further advanced than at eight o'clock in the morning the captain then decided to take more direct means ah said he that animal goes quicker than the abraham lincoln very well we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets send your men to the forecastle sir the forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round but the shot passed some feet above the cetacean which was half a mile off another more to the right cried the commander and five dollars to whoever will hit that infernal beast an old gunner with a grey beard that i can see now with steady eye and grave face went up to the gun and took a long aim a loud report was heard with which were mingled the cheers of the crew the bullet did its work it hit the animal and sliding off the rounded surface was lost in two miles depth of sea the chase began again and the captain leaning towards me said i will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up yes answered i and you will be quite right to do it i wished the beast would exhaust itself and not be insensible to fatigue like a steam engine but it was of no use hours passed without its showing any signs of exhaustion however it must be said in praise of the abraham lincoln that she struggled on indefatigably i cannot reckon the distance she made under three hundred miles during this unlucky day november the 6th but night came on and overshadowed the rough ocean now i thought our expedition was at an end and that we should never again see the extraordinary animal i was mistaken at ten minutes to eleven in the evening the electric light reappeared three miles to windward of the frigate as pure as intense as during the preceding night the narwhal seemed motionless perhaps tired with its"
