freestone work and varied outlines that were faintly revealed it was christminster unquestionably either directly seen or miraged in the peculiar atmosphere the spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes lost their shine going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles the vague city became veiled in mist turning to the west he saw that the sun had disappeared the foreground of the scene had grown funereally dark and near objects put on the hues and shapes of chimaeras he anxiously descended the ladder and started homewards at a run trying not to think of giants herne the hunter apollyon lying in wait for christian or of the captain with the bleeding hole in his forehead and the corpses round him that remutinied every night on board the bewitched ship he knew that he had grown out of belief in these horrors yet he was glad when he saw the church tower and the lights in the cottage windows even though this was not the home of his birth and his great aunt did not care much about him inside and round about that old woman's shop window with its twenty four little panes set in lead work the glass of some of them oxidized with age so that you could hardly see the poor penny articles exhibited within and forming part of a stock which a strong man could have carried jude had his outer being for some long tideless time but his dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings were small through the solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to the northward he was always beholding a gorgeous city the fancied place he had likened to the new jerusalem though there was perhaps more of the painter's imagination and less of the diamond merchant's in his dreams thereof than in those of the apocalyptic writer and the city acquired a tangibility a permanence a hold on his life mainly from the one nucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes he had so much reverence was actually living there not only so but living among the more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein in sad wet seasons though he knew it must rain at christminster too he could hardly believe that it rained so drearily there whenever he could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two which was not often he would steal off to the brown house on the hill and strain his eyes persistently sometimes to be rewarded by the sight of a dome or spire at other times by a little smoke which in his estimate had some of the mysticism of incense then the day came when it suddenly occurred to him that if he ascended to the point of view after dark or possibly went a mile or two further he would see the night lights of the city it would be necessary to come back alone but even that consideration did not deter him for he could throw a little manliness into his mood no doubt the project was duly executed it was not late when he arrived at the place of outlook only just after dusk but a black north east sky accompanied by a wind from the same quarter made the occasion dark enough he was rewarded but what he saw was not the lamps in rows as he had half expected no individual light was visible only a halo or glow fog over arching the place against the black heavens behind it making the light and the city seem distant but a mile or so he set himself to wonder on the exact point in the glow where the schoolmaster might be he who never communicated with anybody at marygreen now who was as if dead to them here in the glow he seemed to see phillotson promenading at ease like one of the forms in nebuchadnezzar's furnace he had heard that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour and the fact now came into his mind he parted his lips as he faced the north east and drew in the wind as if it were a sweet liquor you he said addressing the breeze caressingly were in christminster city between one and two hours ago floating along the streets pulling round the weather cocks touching mr phillotson's face being breathed by him and now you are here breathed by me you the very same suddenly there came along this wind something towards him a message from the place from some soul residing there it seemed surely it was the sound of bells the voice of the city faint and musical calling to him we are happy here he had become entirely lost to his bodily situation during this mental leap and only got back to it by a rough recalling a few yards below the brow of the hill on which he paused a team of horses made its appearance having reached the place by dint of half an hour's serpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity they had a load of coals behind them a fuel that could only be got into the upland by this particular route they were accompanied by a carter a second man and a boy who now kicked a large stone behind one of the wheels and allowed the panting animals to have a long rest while those in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged in a drink round they were elderly men and had genial voices jude addressed them inquiring if they had come from christminster heaven forbid with this load said they the place i mean is that one yonder he was getting so romantically attached to christminster that like a young lover alluding to his mistress he felt bashful at mentioning its name again he pointed to the light in the sky hardly perceptible to their older eyes yes there do seem a spot a bit brighter in the nor east than elsewhere though i shouldn't ha noticed it myself and no doubt it med be christminster here a little book of tales which jude had tucked up under his arm having brought them to read on his way hither before it grew dark slipped and fell into the road the carter eyed him while he picked it up and straightened the leaves ah young man he observed you'd have to get your head screwed on t'other way before you could read what they read there why asked the boy oh they never look at anything that folks like we can understand the carter continued by way of passing the time on'y foreign tongues used in the days of the tower of babel when no two families spoke alike they read that sort of thing as fast as a night hawk will whir tis all learning there nothing but learning except religion and that's learning too for i never could understand it yes tis a serious minded place not but there's wenches in the streets o nights you know i suppose that they raise pa'sons there like radishes in a bed and though it do take how many years bob five years to turn a lirruping hobble de hoy chap into a solemn preaching man with no corrupt passions they'll do it if it can be done and polish un off like the workmen they be and turn un out wi a long face and a long black coat and waistcoat and a religious collar and hat same as they used to wear in the scriptures so that his own mother wouldn't know un sometimes there tis their business like anybody else's but how should you know now don't you interrupt my boy never interrupt your senyers move the fore hoss aside bobby here's som'at coming you must mind that i be a talking of the college life em lives on a lofty level there's no gainsaying it though i myself med not think much of em as we be here in our bodies on this high ground so be they in their minds noble minded men enough no doubt some on em able to earn hundreds by thinking out loud and some on em be strong young fellows that can earn a'most as much in silver cups as for music there's beautiful music everywhere in christminster you med be religious or you med not but you can't help striking in your homely note with the rest and there's a street in the place the main street that ha'n't another like it in the world i should think i did know a little about christminster by this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their collars again jude throwing a last adoring look at the distant halo turned and walked beside his remarkably well informed friend who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of the city its towers and halls and churches the waggon turned into a cross road whereupon jude thanked the carter warmly for his information and said he only wished he could talk half as well about christminster as he well tis oonly what has come in my way said the carter unboastfully i've never been there no more than you but i've picked up the knowledge here and there and you be welcome to it a getting about the world as i do and mixing with all classes of society one can't help hearing of things a friend o mine that used to clane the boots at the crozier hotel in christminster when he was in his prime why i knowed un as well as my own brother in his later years jude continued his walk homeward alone pondering so deeply that he forgot to feel timid he suddenly grew older it had been the yearning of his heart to find something to anchor on to cling to for some place which he could call admirable should he find that place in this city if he could get there would it be a spot in which without fear of farmers or hindrance or ridicule he could watch and wait and set himself to some mighty undertaking like the men of old of whom he had heard as the halo had been to his eyes when gazing at it a quarter of an hour earlier so was the spot mentally to him as he pursued his dark way it is a city of light he said to himself the tree of knowledge grows there he added a few steps further on it is a place that teachers of men spring from and go to it is what you may call a castle manned by scholarship and religion after this figure he was silent a long while till he added it would just suit me iv walking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration the boy an ancient man in some phases of thought much younger than his years in others was overtaken by a light footed pedestrian whom notwithstanding the gloom he could perceive to be wearing an extraordinarily tall hat a swallow tailed coat and a watch chain that danced madly and threw around scintillations of sky light as its owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots jude beginning to feel lonely endeavoured to keep up with him well my man i'm in a hurry so you'll have to walk pretty fast if you keep alongside of me do you know who i am yes i think physician vilbert ah i'm known everywhere i see that comes of being a public benefactor vilbert was an itinerant quack doctor well known to the rustic population and absolutely unknown to anybody else as he indeed took care to be to avoid inconvenient investigations cottagers formed his only patients and his wessex wide repute was among them alone his position was humbler and his field more obscure than those of the quacks with capital and an organized system of advertising he was in fact a survival the distances he traversed on foot were enormous and extended nearly the whole length and breadth of wessex jude had one day seen him selling a pot of coloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg the woman arranging to pay a guinea in instalments of a shilling a fortnight for the precious salve which according to the physician could only be obtained from a particular animal which grazed on mount sinai and was to be captured only at great risk to life and limb jude though he already had his doubts about this gentleman's medicines felt him to be unquestionably a travelled personage and one who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not strictly professional i s'pose you've been to christminster physician i have many times replied the long thin man that's one of my centres it's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion you'd say so my boy if you'd seen it why the very sons of the old women who do the washing of the colleges can talk in latin not good latin that i admit as a critic dog latin cat latin as we used to call it in my undergraduate days and greek well that's more for the men who are in training for bishops that they may be able to read the new testament in the original i want to learn latin and greek myself a lofty desire you must get a grammar of each tongue i mean to go to christminster some day whenever you do you say that physician vilbert is the only proprietor of those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all disorders of the alimentary system as well as asthma and shortness of breath two and threepence a box specially licensed by the government stamp can you get me the grammars if i promise to say it hereabout i'll sell you mine with pleasure those i used as a student oh thank you sir said jude gratefully but in gasps for the amazing speed of the physician's walk kept him in a dog trot which was giving him a stitch in the side i think you'd better drop behind my young man now i'll tell you what i'll do i'll get you the grammars and give you a first lesson if you'll remember at every house in the village to recommend physician vilbert's golden ointment life drops and female pills where will you be with the grammars i shall be passing here this day fortnight at precisely this hour of five and twenty minutes past seven my movements are as truly timed as those of the planets in their courses here i'll be to meet you said jude with orders for my medicines yes physician jude then dropped behind waited a few minutes to recover breath and went home with a consciousness of having struck a blow for christminster through the intervening fortnight he ran about and smiled outwardly at his inward thoughts as if they were people meeting and nodding to him smiled with that singularly beautiful irradiation which is seen to spread on young faces at the inception of some glorious idea as if a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures giving rise to the flattering fancy that heaven lies about them then he honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures in whom he now sincerely believed walking miles hither and thither among the surrounding hamlets as the physician's agent in advance on the evening appointed he stood motionless on the plateau at the place where he had parted from vilbert and there awaited his approach the road physician was fairly up to time but to the surprise of jude on striking into his pace which the pedestrian did not diminish by a single unit of force the latter seemed hardly to recognize his young companion though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings had grown light jude thought it might perhaps be owing to his wearing another hat and he saluted the physician with dignity well my boy said the latter abstractedly i've come said jude you who are you oh yes to be sure got any orders lad yes and jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers who were willing to test the virtues of the world renowned pills and salve the quack mentally registered these with great care and the latin and greek grammars jude's voice trembled with anxiety what about them you were to bring me yours that you used before you took your degree ah yes yes forgot all about it all so many lives depending on my attention you see my man that i can't give so much thought as i would like to other things jude controlled himself sufficiently long to make sure of the truth and he repeated in a voice of dry misery you haven't brought em no but you must get me some more orders from sick people and i'll bring the grammars next time jude dropped behind he was an unsophisticated boy but the gift of sudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him all at once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of there was to be no intellectual light from this source the leaves dropped from his imaginary crown of laurel he turned to a gate leant against it and cried bitterly the disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness he might perhaps have obtained grammars from alfredston but to do that required money and a knowledge of what books to order and though physically comfortable he was in such absolute dependence as to be without a farthing of his own at this date mr phillotson sent for his pianoforte and it gave jude a lead why should he not write to the schoolmaster and ask him to be so kind as to get him the grammars in christminster he might slip a letter inside the case of the instrument and it would be sure to reach the desired eyes why not ask him to send any old second hand copies which would have the charm of being mellowed by the university atmosphere to tell his aunt of his intention would be to defeat it it was necessary to act alone after a further consideration of a few days he did act and on the day of the piano's departure which happened to be his next birthday clandestinely placed the letter inside the packing case directed to his much admired friend being afraid to reveal the operation to his aunt drusilla lest she should discover his motive and compel him to abandon his scheme the piano was despatched and jude waited days and weeks calling every morning at the cottage post office before his great aunt was stirring at last a packet did indeed arrive at the village and he saw from the ends of it that it contained two thin books he took it away into a lonely place and sat down on a felled elm to open it ever since his first ecstasy or vision of christminster and its possibilities jude had meditated much and curiously on the probable sort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one language into those of another he concluded that a grammar of the required tongue would contain primarily a rule prescription or clue of the nature of a secret cipher which once known would enable him by merely applying it to change at will all words of his own speech into those of the foreign one his childish idea was in fact a pushing to the extremity of mathematical precision what is everywhere known as grimm's law an aggrandizement of rough rules to ideal completeness thus he assumed that the words of the required language were always to be found somewhere latent in the words of the given language by those who had the art to uncover them such art being furnished by the books aforesaid when therefore having noted that the packet bore the postmark of christminster he cut the string opened the volumes and turned to the latin grammar which chanced to come uppermost he could scarcely believe his eyes the book was an old one thirty years old soiled scribbled wantonly over with a strange name in every variety of enmity to the letterpress and marked at random with dates twenty years earlier than his own day but this was not the cause of jude's amazement he learnt for the first time that there was no law of transmutation as in his innocence he had supposed there was in some degree but the grammarian did not recognize it but that every word in both latin and greek was to be individually committed to memory at the cost of years of plodding jude flung down the books lay backward along the broad trunk of the elm and was an utterly miserable boy for the space of a quarter of an hour as he had often done before he pulled his hat over his face and watched the sun peering insidiously at him through the interstices of the straw this was latin and greek then was it this grand delusion the charm he had supposed in store for him was really a labour like that of israel in egypt what brains they must have in christminster and the great schools he presently thought to learn words one by one up to tens of thousands there were no brains in his head equal to this business and as the little sun rays continued to stream in through his hat at him he wished he had never seen a book that he might never see another that he had never been born somebody might have come along that way who would have asked him his trouble and might have cheered him by saying that his notions were further advanced than those of his grammarian but nobody did come because nobody does and under the crushing recognition of his gigantic error jude continued to wish himself out of the world v during the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular vehicle might have been discerned moving along the lanes and by roads near marygreen driven in a quaint and singular way in the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books jude had grown callous to the shabby trick played him by the dead languages in fact his disappointment at the nature of those tongues had after a while been the means of still further glorifying the erudition of christminster to acquire languages departed or living in spite of such obstinacies as he now knew them inherently to possess was a herculean performance which gradually led him on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent process the mountain weight of material under which the ideas lay in those dusty volumes called the classics piqued him into a dogged mouselike subtlety of attempt to move it piecemeal he had endeavoured to make his presence tolerable to his crusty maiden aunt by assisting her to the best of his ability and the business of the little cottage bakery had grown in consequence an aged horse with a hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at a sale a creaking cart with a whity brown tilt obtained for a few pounds more and in this turn out it became jude's business thrice a week to carry loaves of bread to the villagers and solitary cotters immediately round marygreen the singularity aforesaid lay after all less in the conveyance itself than in jude's manner of conducting it along its route its interior was the scene of most of jude's education by private study as soon as the horse had learnt the road and the houses at which he was to pause awhile the boy seated in front would slip the reins over his arm ingeniously fix open by means of a strap attached to the tilt the volume he was reading spread the dictionary on his knees and plunge into the simpler passages from caesar virgil or horace as the case might be in his purblind stumbling way and with an expenditure of labour that would have made a tender hearted pedagogue shed tears yet somehow getting at the meaning of what he read and divining rather than beholding the spirit of the original which often to his mind was something else than that which he was taught to look for the only copies he had been able to lay hands on were old delphin editions because they were superseded and therefore cheap but bad for idle schoolboys it did so happen that they were passably good for him the hampered and lonely itinerant conscientiously covered up the marginal readings and used them merely on points of construction as he would have used a comrade or tutor who should have happened to be passing by and though jude may have had little chance of becoming a scholar by these rough and ready means he was in the way of getting into the groove he wished to follow while he was busied with these ancient pages which had already been thumbed by hands possibly in the grave digging out the thoughts of these minds so remote yet so near the bony old horse pursued his rounds and jude would be aroused from the woes of dido by the stoppage of his cart and the voice of some old woman crying two to day baker and i return this stale one he was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without his seeing them and by degrees the people of the neighbourhood began to talk about his method of combining work and play such they considered his reading to be which though probably convenient enough to himself was not altogether a safe proceeding for other travellers along the same roads there were murmurs then a private resident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman that the baker's boy should not be allowed to read while driving and insisted that it was the constable's duty to catch him in the act and take him to the police court at alfredston and get him fined for dangerous practices on the highway the policeman thereupon lay in wait for jude and one day accosted him and cautioned him as jude had to get up at three o'clock in the morning to heat the oven and mix and set in the bread that he distributed later in the day he was obliged to go to bed at night immediately after laying the sponge so that if he could not read his classics on the highways he could hardly study at all the only thing to be done was therefore to keep a sharp eye ahead and around him as well as he could in the circumstances and slip away his books as soon as anybody loomed in the distance the policeman in particular to do that official justice he did not put himself much in the way of jude's bread cart considering that in such a lonely district the chief danger was to jude himself and often on seeing the white tilt over the hedges he would move in another direction on a day when fawley was getting quite advanced being now about sixteen and had been stumbling through the carmen saeculare on his way home he found himself to be passing over the high edge of the plateau by the brown house the light had changed and it was the sense of this which had caused him to look up the sun was going down and the full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in the opposite quarter his mind had become so impregnated with the poem that in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years before had caused him to kneel on the ladder he stopped the horse alighted and glancing round to see that nobody was in sight knelt down on the roadside bank with open book he turned first to the shiny goddess who seemed to look so softly and critically at his doings then to the disappearing luminary on the other hand as he began phoebe silvarumque potens diana the horse stood still till he had finished the hymn which jude repeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he would never have thought of humouring in broad daylight reaching home he mused over his curious superstition innate or acquired in doing this and the strange forgetfulness which had led to such a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished next to being a scholar to be a christian divine it had all come of reading heathen works exclusively the more he thought of it the more convinced he was of his inconsistency he began to wonder whether he could be reading quite the right books for his object in life certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan literature and the mediaeval colleges at christminster that ecclesiastical romance in stone ultimately he decided that in his sheer love of reading he had taken up a wrong emotion for a christian young man he had dabbled in clarke's homer but had never yet worked much at the new testament in the greek though he possessed a copy obtained by post from a second hand bookseller he abandoned the now familiar ionic for a new dialect and"
