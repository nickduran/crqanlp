fourth had discarded the blue bows but her freckles were not noticeably less i never did think i'd come down to marrying a yankee miss shirley ma'am she said but you never know what's before you and it isn't his fault he was born that way you're a yankee yourself charlotta since you've married one miss shirley ma'am i'm not and i wouldn't be if i was to marry a dozen yankees tom's kind of nice

satisfied miss shirley ma'am does he call you leonora asked anne goodness no miss shirley ma'am i wouldn't know who he meant if he did of course when we got married he had to say i take thee leonora and i declare to you miss shirley ma'am i've had the most dreadful feeling ever since that it wasn't me he was talking to and i haven't been rightly married at all and so you're going to be married yourself miss shirley ma'am i always thought i'd like to marry a doctor it would be so handy when the children had measles and croup tom is only a bricklayer but he's real good tempered when i said to him says i tom can i go to miss shirley's wedding i mean to go anyhow but i'd like to have your consent he just says suit yourself charlotta and you'll suit me that's a real pleasant kind of husband to have miss shirley ma'am philippa and her reverend jo arrived at green gables the day before the wedding anne and phil had a rapturous meeting which presently simmered down to a cosy confidential chat over all that had been and was about to be queen anne you're as queenly as ever i've got fearfully thin since the babies came i'm not half so good looking but i think jo likes it there's not such a contrast between us you see and oh it's perfectly magnificent that you're going to marry gilbert roy gardner wouldn't have done at all at all i can see that now though i was horribly disappointed at the time you know anne you did treat roy very badly he has recovered i understand smiled anne oh yes he is married and his wife is a sweet little thing and they're perfectly happy everything works together for good jo and the bible say that and they are pretty good authorities are alec and alonzo married yet alec is but alonzo isn't how those dear old days at patty's place come back when i'm talking to you anne what fun we had have you been to patty's place lately oh yes i go often miss patty and miss maria still sit by the fireplace and knit and that reminds me we've brought you a wedding gift from them anne guess what it is i never could how did they know i was going to be married oh i told them i was there last week and they were so interested two days ago miss patty wrote me a note asking me to call and then she asked if i would take her gift to you what would you wish most from patty's place anne you can't mean that miss patty has sent me her china dogs go up head they're in my trunk this very moment and i've a letter for you wait a moment and i'll get it dear miss shirley miss patty had written maria and i were very much interested in hearing of your approaching nuptials we send you our best wishes maria and i have never married but we have no objection to other people doing so we are sending you the china dogs i intended to leave them to you in my will because you seemed to have sincere affection for them but maria and i expect to live a good while yet d.v so i have decided to give you the dogs while you are young you will not have forgotten that gog looks to the right and magog to the left just fancy those lovely old dogs sitting by the fireplace in my house of dreams said anne rapturously i never expected anything so delightful that evening green gables hummed with preparations for the following day but in the twilight anne slipped away she had a little pilgrimage to make on this last day of her girlhood and she must make it alone she went to matthew's grave in the little poplar shaded avonlea graveyard and there kept a silent tryst with old memories and immortal loves how glad matthew would be tomorrow if he were here she whispered but i believe he does know and is glad of it somewhere else i've read somewhere that our dead are never dead until we have forgotten them matthew will never be dead to me for i can never forget him she left on his grave the flowers she had brought and walked slowly down the long hill it was a gracious evening full of delectable lights and shadows in the west was a sky of mackerel clouds crimson and amber tinted with long strips of apple green sky between beyond was the glimmering radiance of a sunset sea and the ceaseless voice of many waters came up from the tawny shore all around her lying in the fine beautiful country silence were the hills and fields and woods she had known and loved so long history repeats itself said gilbert joining her as she passed the blythe gate do you remember our first walk down this hill anne our first walk together anywhere for that matter i was coming home in the twilight from matthew's grave and you came out of the gate and i swallowed the pride of years and spoke to you and all heaven opened before me supplemented gilbert from that moment i looked forward to tomorrow when i left you at your gate that night and walked home i was the happiest boy in the world anne had forgiven me i think you had the most to forgive i was an ungrateful little wretch and after you had really saved my life that day on the pond too how i loathed that load of obligation at first i don't deserve the happiness that has come to me gilbert laughed and clasped tighter the girlish hand that wore his ring anne's engagement ring was a circlet of pearls she had refused to wear a diamond i've never really liked diamonds since i found out they weren't the lovely purple i had dreamed they will always suggest my old disappointment but pearls are for tears the old legend says gilbert had objected i'm not afraid of that and tears can be happy as well as sad my very happiest moments have been when i had tears in my eyes when marilla told me i might stay at green gables when matthew gave me the first pretty dress i ever had when i heard that you were going to recover from the fever so give me pearls for our troth ring gilbert and i'll willingly accept the sorrow of life with its joy but tonight our lovers thought only of joy and never of sorrow for the morrow was their wedding day and their house of dreams awaited them on the misty purple shore of four winds harbor chapter 4 the first bride of green gables anne wakened on the morning of her wedding day to find the sunshine winking in at the window of the little porch gable and a september breeze frolicking with her curtains i'm so glad the sun will shine on me she thought happily she recalled the first morning she had wakened in that little porch room when the sunshine had crept in on her through the blossom drift of the old snow queen that had not been a happy wakening for it brought with it the bitter disappointment of the preceding night but since then the little room had been endeared and consecrated by years of happy childhood dreams and maiden visions to it she had come back joyfully after all her absences at its window she had knelt through that night of bitter agony when she believed gilbert dying and by it she had sat in speechless happiness the night of her betrothal many vigils of joy and some of sorrow had been kept there and today she must leave it forever henceforth it would be hers no more fifteen year old dora was to inherit it when she had gone nor did anne wish it otherwise the little room was sacred to youth and girlhood to the past that was to close today before the chapter of wifehood opened green gables was a busy and joyous house that forenoon diana arrived early with little fred and small anne cordelia to lend a hand davy and dora the green gables twins whisked the babies off to the garden don't let small anne cordelia spoil her clothes warned diana anxiously you needn't be afraid to trust her with dora said marilla that child is more sensible and careful than most of the mothers i've known she's really a wonder in some ways not much like that other harum scarum i brought up marilla smiled across her chicken salad at anne it might even be suspected that she liked the harum scarum best after all those twins are real nice children said mrs rachel when she was sure they were out of earshot dora is so womanly and helpful and davy is developing into a very smart boy he isn't the holy terror for mischief he used to be i never was so distracted in my life as i was the first six months he was here acknowledged marilla after that i suppose i got used to him he's taken a great notion to farming lately and wants me to let him try running the farm next year i may for mr barry doesn't think he'll want to rent it much longer and some new arrangement will have to be made well you certainly have a lovely day for your wedding anne said diana as she slipped a voluminous apron over her silken array you couldn't have had a finer one if you'd ordered it from eaton's indeed there's too much money going out of this island to that same eaton's said mrs lynde indignantly she had strong views on the subject of octopus like department stores and never lost an opportunity of airing them and as for those catalogues of theirs they're the avonlea girls bible now that's what they pore over them on sundays instead of studying the holy scriptures well they're splendid to amuse children with said diana fred and small anne look at the pictures by the hour _i_ amused ten children without the aid of eaton's catalogue said mrs rachel severely come you two don't quarrel over eaton's catalogue said anne gaily this is my day of days you know i'm so happy i want every one else to be happy too i'm sure i hope your happiness will last child sighed mrs rachel she did hope it truly and believed it but she was afraid it was in the nature of a challenge to providence to flaunt your happiness too openly anne for her own good must be toned down a trifle but it was a happy and beautiful bride who came down the old homespun carpeted stairs that september noon the first bride of green gables slender and shining eyed in the mist of her maiden veil with her arms full of roses gilbert waiting for her in the hall below looked up at her with adoring eyes she was his at last this evasive long sought anne won after years of patient waiting it was to him she was coming in the sweet surrender of the bride was he worthy of her could he make her as happy as he hoped if he failed her if he could not measure up to her standard of manhood then as she held out her hand their eyes met and all doubt was swept away in a glad certainty they belonged to each other and no matter what life might hold for them it could never alter that their happiness was in each other's keeping and both were unafraid they were married in the sunshine of the old orchard circled by the loving and kindly faces of long familiar friends mr allan married them and the reverend jo made what mrs rachel lynde afterwards pronounced to be the most beautiful wedding prayer she had ever heard birds do not often sing in september but one sang sweetly from some hidden bough while gilbert and anne repeated their deathless vows anne heard it and thrilled to it gilbert heard it and wondered only that all the birds in the world had not burst into jubilant song paul heard it and later wrote a lyric about it which was one of the most admired in his first volume of verse charlotta the fourth heard it and was blissfully sure it meant good luck for her adored miss shirley the bird sang until the ceremony was ended and then it wound up with one mad little glad little trill never had the old gray green house among its enfolding orchards known a blither merrier afternoon all the old jests and quips that must have done duty at weddings since eden were served up and seemed as new and brilliant and mirth provoking as if they had never been uttered before laughter and joy had their way and when anne and gilbert left to catch the carmody train with paul as driver the twins were ready with rice and old shoes in the throwing of which charlotta the fourth and mr harrison bore a valiant part marilla stood at the gate and watched the carriage out of sight down the long lane with its banks of goldenrod anne turned at its end to wave her last good bye she was gone green gables was her home no more marilla's face looked very gray and old as she turned to the house which anne had filled for fourteen years and even in her absence with light and life but diana and her small fry the echo lodge people and the allans had stayed to help the two old ladies over the loneliness of the first evening and they contrived to have a quietly pleasant little supper time sitting long around the table and chatting over all the details of the day while they were sitting there anne and gilbert were alighting from the train at glen st mary chapter 5 the home coming dr david blythe had sent his horse and buggy to meet them and the urchin who had brought it slipped away with a sympathetic grin leaving them to the delight of driving alone to their new home through the radiant evening anne never forgot the loveliness of the view that broke upon them when they had driven over the hill behind the village her new home could not yet be seen but before her lay four winds harbor like a great shining mirror of rose and silver far down she saw its entrance between the bar of sand dunes on one side and a steep high grim red sandstone cliff on the other beyond the bar the sea calm and austere dreamed in the afterlight the little fishing village nestled in the cove where the sand dunes met the harbor shore looked like a great opal in the haze the sky over them was like a jewelled cup from which the dusk was pouring the air was crisp with the compelling tang of the sea and the whole landscape was infused with the subtleties of a sea evening a few dim sails drifted along the darkening fir clad harbor shores a bell was ringing from the tower of a little white church on the far side mellowly and dreamily sweet the chime floated across the water blent with the moan of the sea the great revolving light on the cliff at the channel flashed warm and golden against the clear northern sky a trembling quivering star of good hope far out along the horizon was the crinkled gray ribbon of a passing steamer's smoke oh beautiful beautiful murmured anne i shall love four winds gilbert where is our house we can't see it yet the belt of birch running up from that little cove hides it it's about two miles from glen st mary and there's another mile between it and the light house we won't have many neighbors anne there's only one house near us and i don't know who lives in it shall you be lonely when i'm away not with that light and that loveliness for company who lives in that house gilbert i don't know it doesn't look exactly as if the occupants would be kindred spirits anne does it the house was a large substantial affair painted such a vivid green that the landscape seemed quite faded by contrast there was an orchard behind it and a nicely kept lawn before it but somehow there was a certain bareness about it perhaps its neatness was responsible for this the whole establishment house barns orchard garden lawn and lane was so starkly neat it doesn't seem probable that anyone with that taste in paint could be very kindred acknowledged anne unless it were an accident like our blue hall i feel certain there are no children there at least it's even neater than the old copp place on the tory road and i never expected to see anything neater than that they had not met anybody on the moist red road that wound along the harbor shore but just before they came to the belt of birch which hid their home anne saw a girl who was driving a flock of snow white geese along the crest of a velvety green hill on the right great scattered firs grew along it between their trunks one saw glimpses of yellow harvest fields gleams of golden sand hills and bits of blue sea the girl was tall and wore a dress of pale blue print she walked with a certain springiness of step and erectness of bearing she and her geese came out of the gate at the foot of the hill as anne and gilbert passed she stood with her hand on the fastening of the gate and looked steadily at them with an expression that hardly attained to interest but did not descend to curiosity it seemed to anne for a fleeting moment that there was even a veiled hint of hostility in it but it was the girl's beauty which made anne give a little gasp a beauty so marked that it must have attracted attention anywhere she was hatless but heavy braids of burnished hair the hue of ripe wheat were twisted about her head like a coronet her eyes were blue and star like her figure in its plain print gown was magnificent and her lips were as crimson as the bunch of blood red poppies she wore at her belt gilbert who is the girl we have just passed asked anne in a low voice i didn't notice any girl said gilbert who had eyes only for his bride she was standing by that gate no don't look back she is still watching us i never saw such a beautiful face i don't remember seeing any very handsome girls while i was here there are some pretty girls up at the glen but i hardly think they could be called beautiful this girl is you can't have seen her or you would remember her nobody could forget her i never saw such a face except in pictures and her hair it made me think of browning's cord of gold and gorgeous snake probably she's some visitor in four winds likely some one from that big summer hotel over the harbor she wore a white apron and she was driving geese she might do that for amusement look anne there's our house anne looked and forgot for a time the girl with the splendid resentful eyes the first glimpse of her new home was a delight to eye and spirit it looked so like a big creamy seashell stranded on the harbor shore the rows of tall lombardy poplars down its lane stood out in stately purple silhouette against the sky behind it sheltering its garden from the too keen breath of sea winds was a cloudy fir wood in which the winds might make all kinds of weird and haunting music like all woods it seemed to be holding and enfolding secrets in its recesses secrets whose charm is only to be won by entering in and patiently seeking outwardly dark green arms keep them inviolate from curious or indifferent eyes the night winds were beginning their wild dances beyond the bar and the fishing hamlet across the harbor was gemmed with lights as anne and gilbert drove up the poplar lane the door of the little house opened and a warm glow of firelight flickered out into the dusk gilbert lifted anne from the buggy and led her into the garden through the little gate between the ruddy tipped firs up the trim red path to the sandstone step welcome home he whispered and hand in hand they stepped over the threshold of their house of dreams chapter 6 captain jim old doctor dave and mrs doctor dave had come down to the little house to greet the bride and groom doctor dave was a big jolly white whiskered old fellow and mrs doctor was a trim rosy cheeked silver haired little lady who took anne at once to her heart literally and figuratively i'm so glad to see you dear you must be real tired we've got a bite of supper ready and captain jim brought up some trout for you captain jim where are you oh he's slipped out to see to the horse i suppose come upstairs and take your things off anne looked about her with bright appreciative eyes as she followed mrs doctor dave upstairs she liked the appearance of her new home very much it seemed to have the atmosphere of green gables and the flavor of her old traditions i think i would have found miss elizabeth russell a kindred spirit she murmured when she was alone in her room there were two windows in it the dormer one looked out on the lower harbor and the sand bar and the four winds light a magic casement opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn quoted anne softly the gable window gave a view of a little harvest hued valley through which a brook ran half a mile up the brook was the only house in sight an old rambling gray one surrounded by huge willows through which its windows peered like shy seeking eyes into the dusk anne wondered who lived there they would be her nearest neighbors and she hoped they would be nice she suddenly found herself thinking of the beautiful girl with the white geese gilbert thought she didn't belong here mused anne but i feel sure she does there was something about her that made her part of the sea and the sky and the harbor four winds is in her blood when anne went downstairs gilbert was standing before the fireplace talking to a stranger both turned as anne entered anne this is captain boyd captain boyd my wife it was the first time gilbert had said my wife to anybody but anne and he narrowly escaped bursting with the pride of it the old captain held out a sinewy hand to anne they smiled at each other and were friends from that moment kindred spirit flashed recognition to kindred spirit i'm right down pleased to meet you mistress blythe and i hope you'll be as happy as the first bride was who came here i can't wish you no better than that but your husband doesn't introduce me jest exactly right captain jim is my week a day name and you might as well begin as you're sartain to end up calling me that you sartainly are a nice little bride mistress blythe looking at you sorter makes me feel that i've jest been married myself amid the laughter that followed mrs doctor dave urged captain jim to stay and have supper with them thank you kindly twill be a real treat mistress doctor i mostly has to eat my meals alone with the reflection of my ugly old phiz in a looking glass opposite for company tisn't often i have a chance to sit down with two such sweet purty ladies captain jim's compliments may look very bald on paper but he paid them with such a gracious gentle deference of tone and look that the woman upon whom they were bestowed felt that she was being offered a queen's tribute in a kingly fashion captain jim was a high souled simple minded old man with eternal youth in his eyes and heart he had a tall rather ungainly figure somewhat stooped yet suggestive of great strength and endurance a clean shaven face deeply lined and bronzed a thick mane of iron gray hair falling quite to his shoulders and a pair of remarkably blue deep set eyes which sometimes twinkled and sometimes dreamed and sometimes looked out seaward with a wistful quest in them as of one seeking something precious and lost anne was to learn one day what it was for which captain jim looked it could not be denied that captain jim was a homely man his spare jaws rugged mouth and square brow were not fashioned on the lines of beauty and he had passed through many hardships and sorrows which had marked his body as well as his soul but though at first sight anne thought him plain she never thought anything more about it the spirit shining through that rugged tenement beautified it so wholly they gathered gaily around the supper table the hearth fire banished the chill of the september evening but the window of the dining room was open and sea breezes entered at their own sweet will the view was magnificent taking in the harbor and the sweep of low purple hills beyond the table was heaped with mrs doctor's delicacies but the piece de resistance was undoubtedly the big platter of sea trout thought they'd be sorter tasty after travelling said captain jim they're fresh as trout can be mistress blythe two hours ago they were swimming in the glen pond who is attending to the light tonight captain jim asked doctor dave nephew alec he understands it as well as i do well now i'm real glad you asked me to stay to supper i'm proper hungry didn't have much of a dinner today i believe you half starve yourself most of the time down at that light said mrs doctor dave severely you won't take the trouble to get up a decent meal oh i do mistress doctor i do protested captain jim why i live like a king gen'rally last night i was up to the glen and took home two pounds of steak i meant to have a spanking good dinner today and what happened to the steak asked mrs doctor dave did you lose it on the way home no captain jim looked sheepish just at bedtime a poor ornery sort of dog came along and asked for a night's lodging guess he belonged to some of the fishermen long shore i couldn't turn the poor cur out he had a sore foot so i shut him in the porch with an old bag to lie on and went to bed but somehow i couldn't sleep come to think it over i sorter remembered that the dog looked hungry and you got up and gave him that steak all that steak said mrs doctor dave with a kind of triumphant reproof well there wasn't anything else to give him said captain jim deprecatingly nothing a dog'd care for that is i reckon he was hungry for he made about two bites of it i had a fine sleep the rest of the night but my dinner had to be sorter scanty potatoes and point as you might say the dog he lit out for home this morning i reckon he weren't a vegetarian the idea of starving yourself for a worthless dog sniffed mrs doctor you don't know but he may be worth a lot to somebody protested captain jim he didn't look of much account but you can't go by looks in jedging a dog like meself he might be a real beauty inside the first mate didn't approve of him i'll allow his language was right down forcible but the first mate is prejudiced no use in taking a cat's opinion
