"1" "lingering years ye quenched the voice of my singer hark in your dying ears the song of the conflagration ye left me a widow alone behold the whole of your race consumes sinew and bone and torturing flesh together man mother and maid heaped in a common shambles and already borne by the trade the smoke of your dissolution darkens the stars of night thus she spoke and her stature grew in the people’s sight iii rahéro rahéro was there in the hall asleep beside him his wife comely a mirthful woman one that delighted in life and a girl that was ripe for marriage shy and sly as a mouse and a boy a climber of trees all the hopes of his house unwary with open hands he slept in the midst of his folk and dreamed that he heard a voice crying without and awoke leaping blindly afoot like one from a dream that he fears a hellish glow and clouds were about him it roared in his ears like the sound of the cataract fall that plunges sudden and steep and rahéro swayed as he stood and his reason was still asleep now the flame struck hard on the house wind wielded a fracturing blow and the end of the roof was burst and fell on the sleepers below and the lofty hall and the feast and the prostrate bodies of folk shone red in his eyes a moment and then were swallowed of smoke in the mind of rahéro clearness came and he opened his throat and as when a squall comes sudden the straining sail of a boat thunders aloud and bursts so thundered the voice of the man the wind and the rain he shouted the mustering word of the clan 41 and up and to arms men of vaiau but silence replied or only the voice of the gusts of the fire and nothing beside rahéro stooped and groped he handled his womankind but the fumes of the fire and the kava had quenched the life of their mind and they lay like pillars prone and his hand encountered the boy and there sprang in the gloom of his soul a sudden lightning of joy him can i save he thought if i were speedy enough and he loosened the cloth from his loins and swaddled the child in the stuff and about the strength of his neck he knotted the burden well there where the roof had fallen it roared like the mouth of hell thither rahéro went stumbling on senseless folk and grappled a post of the house and began to climb in the smoke the last alive of vaiau and the son borne by the sire the post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire and the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and thighs and the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his eyes and still he climbed and came to the top the place of proof and thrust a hand through the flame and clambered alive on the roof but even as he did so the wind in a garment of flames and pain wrapped him from head to heel and the waistcloth parted in twain and the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below about the blazing feast house clustered the eyes of the foe watching hand upon weapon lest ever a soul should flee shading the brow from the glare straining the neck to see only to leeward the flames in the wind swept far and wide and the forest sputtered on fire and there might no man abide thither rahéro crept and dropped from the burning eaves and crouching low to the ground in a treble covert of leaves and fire and volleying smoke ran for the life of his soul unseen and behind him under a furnace of ardent coal cairned with a wonder of flame and blotting the night with smoke blazed and were smelted together the bones of all his folk he fled unguided at first but hearing the breakers roar thitherward shaped his way and came at length to the shore sound limbed he was dry eyed but smarted in every part and the mighty cage of his ribs heaved on his straining heart with sorrow and rage and fools he cried fools of vaiau heads of swine gluttons alas and where are they now those that i played with those that nursed me those that i nursed god and i outliving them i the least and the worst i that thought myself crafty snared by this herd of swine in the tortures of hell and desolate stripped of all that was mine all my friends and my fathers the silver heads of yore that trooped to the council the children that ran to the open door crying with innocent voices and clasping a father’s knees and mine my wife my daughter my sturdy climber of trees ah never to climb again thus in the dusk of the night for clouds rolled in the sky and the moon was swallowed from sight pacing and gnawing his fists rahéro raged by the shore vengeance that must be his but much was to do before and first a single life to be snatched from a deadly place a life the root of revenge surviving plant of the race and next the race to be raised anew and the lands of the clan repeopled so rahéro designed a prudent man even in wrath and turned for the means of revenge and escape a boat to be seized by stealth a wife to be taken by rape still was the dark lagoon beyond on the coral wall he saw the breakers shine he heard them bellow and fall alone on the top of the reef a man with a flaming brand walked gazing and pausing a fish spear poised in his hand the foam boiled to his calf when the mightier breakers came and the torch shed in the wind scattering tufts of flame afar on the dark lagoon a canoe lay idly at wait a figure dimly guiding it surely the fisherman’s mate rahéro saw and he smiled he straightened his mighty thews naked with never a weapon and covered with scorch and bruise he straightened his arms he filled the void of his body with breath and strong as the wind in his manhood doomed the fisher to death silent he entered the water and silently swam and came there where the fisher walked holding on high the flame loud on the pier of the reef volleyed the breach of the sea and hard at the back of the man rahéro crept to his knee on the coral and suddenly sprang and seized him the elder hand clutching the joint of his throat the other snatching the brand ere it had time to fall and holding it steady and high strong was the fisher brave and swift of mind and of eye strongly he threw in the clutch but rahéro resisted the strain and jerked and the spine of life snapped with a crack in twain and the man came slack in his hands and tumbled a lump at his feet one moment and there on the reef where the breakers whitened and beat rahéro was standing alone glowing and scorched and bare a victor unknown of any raising the torch in the air but once he drank of his breath and instantly set him to fish like a man intent upon supper at home and a savoury dish for what should the woman have seen a man with a torch and then a moment’s blur of the eyes and a man with a torch again and the torch had scarcely been shaken ah surely rahéro said she will deem it a trick of the eyes a fancy born in the head but time must be given the fool to nourish a fool’s belief so for a while a sedulous fisher he walked the reef pausing at times and gazing striking at times with the spear lastly uttered the call and even as the boat drew near like a man that was done with its use tossed the torch in the sea lightly he leaped on the boat beside the woman and she lightly addressed him and yielded the paddle and place to sit for now the torch was extinguished the night was black as the pit rahéro set him to row never a word he spoke and the boat sang in the water urged by his vigorous stroke what ails you the woman asked and why did you drop the brand we have only to kindle another as soon as we come to land never a word rahéro replied but urged the canoe and a chill fell on the woman atta speak is it you speak why are you silent why do you bend aside wherefore steer to the seaward thus she panted and cried never a word from the oarsman toiling there in the dark but right for a gate of the reef he silently headed the bark and wielding the single paddle with passionate sweep on sweep drove her the little fitted forth on the open deep and fear there where she sat froze the woman to stone not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone but a keener fear of the night the dark and the ghostly hour and the thing that drove the canoe with more than a mortal’s power and more than a mortal’s boldness for much she knew of the dead that haunt and fish upon reefs toiling like men for bread and traffic with human fishers or slay them and take their ware till the hour when the star of the dead 51a goes down and the morning air blows and the cocks are singing on shore and surely she knew the speechless thing at her side belonged to the grave 51b it blew all night from the south all night rahéro contended and kept the prow to the cresting sea and silent as though she slept the woman huddled and quaked and now was the peep of day high and long on their left the mountainous island lay and over the peaks of taiárapu arrows of sunlight struck on shore the birds were beginning to sing the ghostly ruck of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave and here on the sea the woman waxing suddenly brave turned her swiftly about and looked in the face of the man and sure he was none that she knew none of her country or clan a stranger mother naked and marred with the marks of fire but comely and great of stature a man to obey and admire and rahéro regarded her also fixed with a frowning face judging the woman’s fitness to mother a warlike race broad of shoulder ample of girdle long in the thigh deep of bosom she was and bravely supported his eye woman said he last night the men of your folk man woman and maid smothered my race in smoke it was done like cowards and i a mighty man of my hands escaped a single life and now to the empty lands and smokeless hearths of my people sail with yourself alone before your mother was born the die of to day was thrown and you selected your husband vainly striving to fall broken between these hands yourself to be severed from all the places the people you love home kindred and clan and to dwell in a desert and bear the babes of a kinless man notes to the song of rahéro introduction this tale of which i have not consciously changed a single feature i received from tradition it is highly popular through all the country of the eight tevas the clan to which rahéro belonged and particularly in taiárapu the windward peninsula of tahiti where he lived i have heard from end to end two versions and as many as five different persons have helped me with details there seems no reason why the tale should not be true 5 note 1 page 5 _the aito_ _quasi_ champion or brave one skilled in the use of some weapon who wandered the country challenging distinguished rivals and taking part in local quarrels it was in the natural course of his advancement to be at last employed by a chief or king and it would then be a part of his duties to purvey the victim for sacrifice one of the doomed families was indicated the aito took his weapon and went forth alone a little behind him bearers followed with the sacrificial basket sometimes the victim showed fight sometimes prevailed more often without doubt he fell but whatever body was found the bearers indifferently took up 7 note 2 page 7 _pai_ _honoura_ and _ahupu_ legendary persons of tahiti all natives of taiárapu of the first two i have collected singular although imperfect legends which i hope soon to lay before the public in another place of ahupu except in snatches of song little memory appears to linger she dwelt at least about tepari the sea cliffs the eastern fastness of the isle walked by paths known only to herself upon the mountains was courted by dangerous suitors who came swimming from adjacent islands and defended and rescued as i gather by the loyalty of native fish my anxiety to learn more of ahupu vehine became during my stay in taiárapu a cause of some diversion to that mirthful people the inhabitants 10a note 3 page 10 _covered an oven_ the cooking fire is made in a hole in the ground and is then buried 10b note 4 page 10 _flies_ this is perhaps an anachronism even speaking of to day in tahiti the phrase would have to be understood as referring mainly to mosquitoes and these only in watered valleys with close woods such as i suppose to form the surroundings of rahéro’s homestead quarter of a mile away where the air moves freely you shall look in vain for one 13 note 5 page 13 _hook_ of mother of pearl bright hook fishing and that with the spear appear to be the favourite native methods 14 note 6 page 14 _leaves_ the plates of tahiti 16 note 7 page 16 _yottowas_ so spelt for convenience of pronunciation _quasi_ tacksmen in the scottish highlands the organisation of eight subdistricts and eight yottowas to a division which was in use until yesterday among the tevas i have attributed without authority to the next clan see page 33 17 note 8 page 17 _omare_ pronounce as a dactyl a loaded quarter staff one of the two favourite weapons of the tahitian brave the javelin or casting spear was the other 21 note 9 page 21 _the ribbon of light_ still to be seen and heard spinning from one marae to another on tahiti or so i have it upon evidence that would rejoice the psychical society 23a note 10 page 23 _námunu úra_ the complete name is namunu ura te aropa why it should be pronounced námunu dactyllically i cannot see but so i have always heard it this was the clan immediately beyond the tevas on the south coast of the island at the date of the tale the clan organisation must have been very weak there is no particular mention of támatéa’s mother going to papara to the head chief of her own clan which would appear her natural recourse on the other hand she seems to have visited various lesser chiefs among the tevas and these to have excused themselves solely on the danger of the enterprise the broad distinction here drawn between nateva and námunu úra is therefore not impossibly anachronistic 23b note 11 page 23 _hiopa the king_ hiopa was really the name of the king chief of vaiau but i could never learn that of the king of paea pronounce to rhyme with the indian _ayah_ and i gave the name where it was most needed this note must appear otiose indeed to readers who have never heard of either of these two gentlemen and perhaps there is only one person in the world capable at once of reading my verses and spying the inaccuracy for him for mr tati salmon hereditary high chief of the tevas the note is solely written a small attention from a clansman to his chief 25 note 12 page 25 _let the pigs be tapu_ it is impossible to explain _tapu_ in a note we have it as an english word taboo suffice it that a thing which was _tapu_ must not be touched nor a place that was _tapu_ visited 34 note 13 page 34 _fish_ _the food of desire_ there is a special word in the tahitian language to signify _hungering after fish_ i may remark that here is one of my chief difficulties about the whole story how did king commons women and all come to eat together at this feast but it troubled none of my numerous authorities so there must certainly be some natural explanation 41 note 14 page 41 _the mustering word of the clan_ _teva te ua_ _teva te matai_ teva the wind teva the rain 51a note 15 page 51 _the star of the dead_ venus as a morning star i have collected much curious evidence as to this belief the dead retain their taste for a fish diet enter into copartnery with living fishers and haunt the reef and the lagoon the conclusion attributed to the nameless lady of the legend would be reached to day under the like circumstances by ninety per cent of polynesians and here i probably understate by one tenth 51b note 16 page 51 see note 15 above the feast of famine marquesan manners i the priest’s vigil in all the land of the tribe was neither fish nor fruit and the deepest pit of popoi stood empty to the foot 61 the clans upon the left and the clans upon the right now oiled their carven maces and scoured their daggers bright they gat them to the thicket to the deepest of the shade and lay with sleepless eyes in the deadly ambuscade and oft in the starry even the song of morning rose what time the oven smoked in the country of their foes for oft to loving hearts and waiting ears and sight the lads that went to forage returned not with the night now first the children sickened and then the women paled and the great arms of the warrior no more for war availed hushed was the deep drum discarded was the dance and those that met the priest now glanced at him askance the priest was a man of years his eyes were ruby red 62a he neither feared the dark nor the terrors of the dead he knew the songs of races the names of ancient date and the beard upon his bosom would have bought the chief’s estate he dwelt in a high built lodge hard by the roaring shore raised on a noble terrace and with tikis 62b at the door within it was full of riches for he served his nation well and full of the sound of breakers like the hollow of a shell for weeks he let them perish gave never a helping sign but sat on his oiled platform to commune with the divine but sat on his high terrace with the tikis by his side and stared on the blue ocean like a parrot ruby eyed dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height out on the round of the sea the gems of the morning light up from the round of the sea the streamers of the sun but down in the depths of the valley the day was not begun in the blue of the woody twilight burned red the cocoa husk and the women and men of the clan went forth to bathe in the dusk a word that began to go round a word a whisper a start hope that leaped in the bosom fear that knocked on the heart see the priest is not risen look for his door is fast he is going to name the victims he is going to help us at last thrice rose the sun to noon and ever like one of the dead the priest lay still in his house with the roar of the sea in his head there was never a foot on the floor there was never a whisper of speech only the leering tikis stared on the blinding beach again were the mountains fired again the morning broke and all the houses lay still but the house of the priest awoke close in their covering roofs lay and trembled the clan but the agèd red eyed priest ran forth like a lunatic man and the village panted to see him in the jewels of death again in the silver beards of the old and the hair of women slain frenzy shook in his limbs frenzy shone in his eyes and still and again as he ran the valley rang with his cries all day long in the land by cliff and thicket and den he ran his lunatic rounds and howled for the flesh of men all day long he ate not nor ever drank of the brook and all day long in their houses the people listened and shook all day long in their houses they listened with bated breath and never a soul went forth for the sight of the priest was death three were the days of his running as the gods appointed of yore two the nights of his sleeping alone in the place of gore the drunken slumber of frenzy twice he drank to the lees on the sacred stones of the high place under the sacred trees with a lamp at his ashen head he lay in the place of the feast and the sacred leaves of the banyan rustled around the priest last when the stated even fell upon terrace and tree and the shade of the lofty island lay leagues away to sea and all the valleys of verdure were heavy with manna and musk the wreck of the red eyed priest came gasping home in the dusk he reeled across the village he staggered along the shore and between the leering tikis crept groping through his door there went a stir through the lodges the voice of speech awoke once more from the builded platforms arose the evening smoke and those who were mighty in war and those renowned for an art sat in their stated seats and talked of the morrow apart ii the lovers hark away in the woods for the ears of love are sharp stealthily quietly touched the note of the one stringed harp 67 in the lighted house of her father why should taheia start taheia heavy of hair taheia tender of heart taheia the well descended a bountiful dealer in love nimble of foot like the deer and kind of eye like the dove sly and shy as a cat with never a change of face taheia slips to the door like one that would breathe a space saunters and pauses and looks at the stars and lists to the seas then sudden and swift as a cat she plunges under the trees swift as a cat she runs with her garment gathered high leaping nimble of foot running certain of eye and ever to guide her way over the smooth and the sharp ever nearer and nearer the note of the one stringed harp till at length in a glade of the wood with a naked mountain above the sound of the harp thrown down and she in the arms of her love rua taheia they cry my heart my soul and my eyes and clasp and sunder and kiss with lovely laughter and sighs rua taheia my love rua star of my night clasp me hold me and love me single spring of delight and rua folded her close he folded her near and long the living knit to the living and sang the lover’s song _night_ _night it is_ _night upon the palms_ _night_ _night it is_ _the land wind has blown_ _starry_ _starry night_ _over deep and height_ _love_ _love in the valley_ _love all alone_ taheia heavy of hair a foolish thing have we done to bind what gods have sundered unkindly into one why should a lowly lover have touched taheia’s skirt taheia the well descended and rua child of the dirt on high with the haka ikis my father sits in state ten times fifty kinsmen salute him in the gate round all his martial body and in bands across his face the marks of the tattooer proclaim his lofty place i too in the hands of the cunning in the sacred cabin of palm 69 have shrunk like the mimosa and bleated like the lamb round half my tender body that none shall clasp but you for a crest and a fair adornment go dainty lines of blue love love beloved rua love levels all degrees and the well tattooed taheia clings panting to your knees taheia song of the morning how long is the longest love a cry a clasp of the hands a star that falls from above ever at morn in the blue and at night when all is black ever it skulks and trembles with the hunter death on its track hear me taheia death for to morrow the priest shall awake and the names be named of the victims to bleed for the nation’s sake and first of the numbered many that shall be slain ere noon rua the child of the dirt rua the kinless loon for him shall the drum be beat for him be raised the song for him to the sacred high place the chaunting people throng for him the oven smoke as for a speechless beast and the sire of my taheia come greedy to the feast rua be silent spare me taheia closes her ears pity my yearning heart pity my girlish years flee from the cruel hands flee from the knife and coal lie hid in the deeps of the woods rua sire of my soul whither to flee taheia whither in all of the land the fires of the bloody kitchen are kindled on every hand on every hand in the isle a hungry whetting of teeth eyes in the trees above arms in the brush beneath patience to lie in wait cunning to follow the sleuth abroad the foes i have fought and at home the friends of my youth love love beloved rua love has a clearer eye hence from the arms of love you go not forth to die there where the broken mountain drops sheer into the glen there shall you find a hold from the boldest hunter of men there in the deep recess where the sun falls only at noon and only once in the night enters the light of the moon nor ever a sound but of birds or the rain when it falls with a shout for death and the fear of death beleaguer the valley about tapu it is but the gods will surely pardon despair tapu but what of that if rua can only dare tapu and tapu and tapu i know they are every one right but the god of every tapu is not always quick to smite lie secret there my rua in the arms of awful gods sleep in the shade of the trees on the couch of the kindly sods sleep and dream of taheia taheia will wake for you and whenever the land wind blows and the woods are heavy with dew alone through the horror of night 72 with food for the soul of her love taheia the undissuaded will hurry true as the dove taheia the pit of the night crawls with treacherous things spirits of ultimate air and the evil souls of things the souls of the dead the stranglers that perch in the trees of the wood waiters for all things human haters of evil and good rua behold me kiss me look in my eyes and read are these the eyes of a maid that would leave her lover in need brave in the eye of day my father ruled in the fight the child of his loins taheia will play the man in the night so it was spoken and so agreed and taheia arose and smiled in the stars and was gone swift as the swallow goes and rua stood on the hill and sighed and followed her flight and there were the lodges below each with its door alight from folk that sat on the terrace and drew out the even long sudden crowings of laughter monotonous drone of song the quiet passage of souls over his head in the trees 74 and from all around the haven the crumbling thunder of seas farewell my home said rua farewell o quiet seat to morrow in all your valleys the drum of death shall beat iii the feast dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the naked peak and all the village was stirring for now was the priest to speak forth on his terrace he came and sat with the chief in talk his lips were blackened with fever his cheeks were whiter than chalk fever clutched at his hands fever nodded his head but quiet and steady and cruel his eyes shone ruby red"
