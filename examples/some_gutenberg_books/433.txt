"1" "father i had breakfast too late besides i've got to look out for my figure there's a tendency to fat in our family the old man chuckled me for instance said he martha for instance replied jane martha was her one sister married and ten years older than she and spaciously matronly wasn't that davy hull you were talking to down in the woods inquired her father jane laughed you see everything said she i didn't see much when i saw him said her father jane was hugely amused her father watched her laughter the dazzling display of fine teeth with delighted eyes you've got mighty good teeth jenny observed he take care of em you'll never know what misery is till you've got no teeth or next to none he looked disgustedly into his bowl crackers and milk grunted he no teeth and no digestion the only pleasure a man of my age can have left is eating and i'm cheated out of that so you wouldn't approve of my marrying davy said the girl her father grunted chuckled i didn't say that does he want to marry you i didn't say that retorted jane he's an unattached young man and i being merely a woman have got to look out for a husband martin looked gloomy there's no hurry said he you've been away six years seems to me you might stay at home a while oh i'd bring him here popsy i've no intention of leaving you you were in an awful state when i came home that mustn't ever happen again and as you won't live with martha and hugo why i've got to be the victim yes it's up to you miss to take care of me in my declining years you can marry davy if you want to davy or anybody i trust to your good sense if i don't like him i can get rid of him said the girl her father smiled indulgently that's a leetle too up to date for an old man like me observed he the world's moving fast nowadays it's got a long ways from where it was when your ma and i were young do you think davy hull will make a career asked jane she had heard from time to time as much as she cared to hear about the world of a generation before of its bareness and discomfort its primness its repulsive piety its ignorance of all that made life bright and attractive how it quite overlooked this life in its agitation about the extremely problematic life to come i mean a career in politics she explained the old man munched and smacked for full a minute before he said well he can make a pretty good speech yes i reckon he could be taken in hand and pushed he's got a lot of fool college bred ideas about reforming things but he'd soon drop them if he got into the practical swing as soon as he had a taste of success he'd stop being finicky just now he's one of those nice pure chaps who stand off and tell how things ought to be done but he'd get over that jane smiled peculiarly half to herself yes i think he would in fact i'm sure he would she looked at her father do you think he amounts to as much as victor dorn she asked innocently the old man dropped a half raised spoonful of milk and crackers into the bowl with a splash dorn he's a scoundrel he exclaimed shaking with passion i'm going to have that dirty little paper of his stopped and him put out of town impudent puppy foul mouthed demagogue i'll show him why he doesn't amount to anything father remonstrated the girl he's nothing but a common working man isn't he that's all he is the hound replied martin hastings a look of cruelty of tenacious cruelty had come into his face it would have startled a stranger but his daughter had often seen it and it did not disturb her as it had never appeared for anything that in any way touched her life i've let him hang on here too long went on the old man to himself rather than to her first thing i know he'll be dangerous if he's worth while i should think you'd hire him remarked jane shrewdly i wouldn't have such a scoundrel in my employ cried her father oh maybe pursued the daughter maybe you couldn't hire him of course i could scoffed hastings anybody can be hired i don't believe it said the girl bluntly one way or another declared the old man that dorn boy isn't worth the price he'd want what price would he want asked jane how should i know retorted her father angrily you've tried to hire him haven't you persisted she the father concentrated on his crackers and milk presently he said what did that fool hull boy say about dorn to you he doesn't like him replied jane he seems to be jealous of him and opposed to his political views dorn's views ain't politics they're theft and murder and highfalutin nonsense said hastings not unconscious of his feeble anti climax all the same he or rather his mother ought to have got damages from the railway said the girl and there was a sudden and startling shift in her expression to a tenacity as formidable as her father's own but a quiet and secret tenacity old hastings wiped his mouth and began fussing uncomfortably with a cigar i don't blame him for getting bitter and turning against society continued she i'd have done the same thing and so would you hastings lit the cigar they wanted ten thousand dollars he said almost apologetically why they never saw ten thousand cents they could call their own but they lost their bread winner father pleaded the girl and there were young children to bring up and educate oh i hate to think that that we had anything to do with such a wrong it wasn't a wrong jen as i used to tell your ma said the old man much agitated and shrill of voice it was just the course of business the law was with our company jane said nothing she simply gazed steadily at her father he avoided her glance i don't want to hear no more about it he burst out with abrupt violence not another word father i want it settled and settled right said the girl i ask it as a favor don't do it as a matter of business but as a matter of sentiment he shifted uneasily debating when he spoke he was even more explosive than before not a cent not a red give that whelp money to run his crazy paper on not your father while he keeps his mind but mightn't that quiet him pleaded she what's the use of having war when you can have peace you've always laughed at people who let their prejudices stand in the way of their interests you've always laughed at how silly and stupid and costly enmities and revenges are now's your chance to illustrate popsy and she smiled charmingly at him he was greatly softened by her manner and by the wisdom of what she said a wisdom in which as in a mirror he recognized with pleasure her strong resemblance to himself that wouldn't be a bad idea jen said he after reflection if i could get a guarantee but why not do it generously urged the girl generosity inspires generosity you'll make him ashamed of himself with a cynical smile on his shrivelled face the old man slowly shook his big head that made him look as top heavy as a newborn baby that isn't as smart child as what you said before it's in them things that the difference between theory and practice shows he'd take the money and laugh at me no i'll try to get a guarantee he nodded and chuckled yes that was a good idea of yours jen but isn't it just possible that he is a man with with principles of a certain kind suggested she of course he thinks so said hastings they all do but you don't suppose a man of any sense at all could really care about and respect working class people ignorant ungrateful fools _i_ know em didn't i come from among em ain't i dealt with em all my life no that there guy dorn's simply trying to get up and is using them to step up on i did the same thing only i did it in a decent law abiding way i didn't want to tear down those that was up i wanted to go up and join em and i did and his eyes glistened fondly and proudly as he gazed at his daughter she represented the climax of his rising she the lady born and bred in her beautiful clothes with her lovely delicate charms yes he had indeed come up and there before him was the superb tangible evidence of it jane had the strongest belief in her father's worldly wisdom at the same time from what david hull said she had got an impression of a something different from the ordinary human being in this queer victor dorn you'd better move slowly she said to her father there's no hurry and you might be mistaken in him plenty of time asserted her father there's never any need to hurry about giving up money then with one of those uncanny flashes of intuition for which he who was never caught napping was famous he said to her sharply you keep your hands off miss she was thrown into confusion and her embarrassment enraged her against herself what could _i_ do she retorted with a brave attempt at indifference well keep your hands off miss said the old man no female meddling in business i'll stand for most anything but not for that jane was now all eagerness for dropping the subject she wished no further prying of that shrewd mind into her secret thoughts it's hardly likely i'd meddle where i know nothing about the circumstances said she will you drive me down to martha's this request was made solely to change the subject to shift her father to his favorite topic for family conversation his daughter martha mrs hugo galland her weakness for fashionable pastimes her incessant hints and naggings at her father about his dowdy dress his vulgar mannerisms of speech and of conduct especially at table jane had not the remotest intention of letting her father drive her to mrs galland's or anywhere in the melancholy old phaeton buggy behind the fat old nag whose coat was as shabby as the coat of the master or as the top and the side curtains of the sorrowful vehicle it drew along at caterpillar pace when her father was ready to depart for his office in the hastings block the most imposing office building in remsen city jane announced a change of mind i'll ride instead said she i need the exercise and the day isn't too warm all right said martin hastings grumpily he soon got enough of anyone's company even of his favorite daughter's through years of habit he liked to jog about alone revolving in his mind his business affairs counting in fancy his big bundles of securities one by one calculating their returns past present and prospective reviewing the various enterprises in which he was dominant factor working out schemes for getting more profit here for paying less wages there for tightening his grip upon this enterprise for dumping his associates in that for escaping with all the valuable assets from another his appearance as he and his nag dozed along the highroad was as deceptive as that of a hive of bees on a hot day no signs of life except a few sleepy workers crawling languidly in and out at the low broad crack door yet within myriads toiling like mad jane went up to dress she had brought an italian maid with her from florence and a mass of baggage that had given the station loungers at remsen city something to talk about when there was a dearth of new subjects for the rest of their lives she had transformed her own suite in the second story of the big old house into an appearance of the quarters of a twentieth century woman of wealth and leisure in the sitting room were books in four languages on the walls were tasteful reproductions of her favorite old masters the excellence of her education was attested not by the books and pictures but by the absence of those fussy commonplace draperies and bits of bric a brac where with people of no taste and no imagination furnish their houses because they can think of nothing else to fill in the gaps many of jane's ways made sister martha uneasy for martha while admitting that jane through superior opportunity ought to know could not believe that the right sort of people on the other side had thrown over all her beloved formalities and were conducting themselves distressingly like tenement house people for instance martha could not approve jane's habit of smoking cigarettes a habit which by one of those curious freaks of character enormously pleased her father but except in one matter martha entirely approved jane's style of dress she hastened to pronounce it just too elegant and repeated that phrase until jane tried beyond endurance warned her that the word elegant was not used seriously by people of the right sort and that its use was regarded as one of those small but subtle signs of the loathsome middle class the one thing in jane's dress that martha disapproved or rather shied at was her riding suit this was an extremely noisy plaid man's suit for jane rode astride martha could not deny that jane looked simply stunning when seated on her horse and dressed in that garb with her long slim feet and graceful calves encased in a pair of riding boots that looked as if they must have cost something fierce but was it really ladylike hadn't jane made a mistake and adopted a costume worn only by the fashionables among the demi mondaines of whom martha had read and had heard such dreadful delightful stories it was the lively plaid that miss hastings now clad herself in she loved that suit not only did it give her figure a superb opportunity but also it brought out new beauties in her contour and coloring and her head was so well shaped and her hair grew so thickly about brow and ears and nape of neck that it looked full as well plaited and done close as when it was framing her face and half concealing half revealing her charming ears in waves of changeable auburn after a lingering and pardonably pleased look at herself in a long mirror she descended mounted and rode slowly down toward town the old galland homestead was at the western end of town in a quarter that had become almost poor but it was so dignified and its grounds were so extensive that it suggested a manor house with the humble homes of the lord's dependents clustering about it for shelter to reach it jane had to ride through two filthy streets lined with factories as she rode she glanced at the windows where could be seen in dusty air girls and boys busy at furiously driven machines machines that compelled their human slaves to strain every nerve in the monotonous task of keeping them occupied many of the girls and boys paused long enough for a glance at the figure of the man clad girl on the big horse jane happy in the pleasant sunshine in her beauty and health and fine raiment and secure and luxurious position in the world gave a thought of pity to these imprisoned young people how lucky i am she thought not to have been born like that of course we all have our falls now and then but while they always strike on the hard ground i've got a feather bed to fall on when she reached martha's and was ushered into the cool upstairs sitting room in somehow ghastly contrast to the hot rooms where the young working people sweated and strained the subject persisted in its hold on her thoughts there was martha in comfortable corsetless expansiveness an ideal illustration of the worthless idler fattening in purposelessness she was engaged with all her energies in preparing for the ball hugo galland's sister mrs bertrand was giving at the assembly rooms that night i've been hard at it for several days now said she i think at last i see daylight but i want your opinion jane gazed absently at the dress and accompanying articles that had been assembled with so much labor all right said she you'll look fine and dandy martha twitched jane dear don't say that don't use such an expression i know it's your way of joking but lots of people would think you didn't know any better let em think said jane i say and do as i please martha sighed here was one member of her family who could be a credit who could make people forget the unquestionably common origin of the hastingses and of the morleys yet this member was always breaking out into something mortifying something reminiscent of the farm and of the livery stable for the deceased mrs hastings had been daughter of a livery stable keeper in fact had caught martin hastings by the way she rode her father's horses at a sale at a county fair said martha you haven't really looked at my clothes jane why did you go back to calling yourself jane because it's my name replied her sister i know that but you hated it and changed it to jeanne which is so much prettier i don't think so any more replied miss hastings my taste has improved don't be so horribly middle class martha ashamed of everything simple and natural you think you know it all don't you just because you've lived abroad said martha peevishly on the contrary i don't know one tenth as much as i thought i did when i came back from wellesley with a diploma do you like my costume inquired martha eying her finery with the fond yet dubious expression of the woman who likes her own taste but is not sure about its being good taste what a lazy worthless pair we are exclaimed jane hitting her boot leg a tremendous rap with her little cane martha startled good god jane what is it she cried on the way here i passed a lot of factories pursued jane why should those people have to work like like the devil while we sit about planning ball dresses martha settled back comfortably i feel so sorry for those poor people said she absently sympathetic but why demanded jane why why should we be allowed to idle while they have to slave what have we done what are we doing to entitle us to ease what have they done to condemn them to pain and toil you know very well jane that we represent the finer side of life slop ejaculated jane for pity's sake don't let's talk politics wailed martha i know nothing about politics i haven't any brains for that sort of thing is that politics inquired jane i thought politics meant whether the democrats or the republicans or the reformers were to get the offices and the chance to steal everything's politics nowadays said martha comparing the color of the material of her dress with the color of her fat white arm as hugo says that victor dorn is dragging everything into politics even our private business of how we make and spend our own money jane sat down abruptly victor dorn she said in a strange voice who is victor dorn what is victor dorn it seems that i can hear of nothing but victor dorn to day he's too low to talk about said martha amiable and absent why politics replied martha really he is horrid jane to look at no not to look at he's handsome in a way not at all common looking you might take him for a gentleman if you didn't know still he always dresses peculiarly always wears soft hats i think soft hats are so vulgar don't you how hopelessly middle class you are martha mocked jane hugo would as soon think of going in the street in a in a i don't know what hugo is the finest flower of american gentleman that is he's the quintessence of everything that's nice and nasty i wish i were married to him for a week i love hugo but he gives me the creeps she rose and tramped restlessly about the room you both give me the creeps everything conventional gives me the creeps if i'm not careful i'll dress myself in a long shirt let down my hair and run wild what nonsense you do talk said martha composedly jane sat down abruptly so i do she said i'm as poor a creature as you at bottom i simply like to beat against the bars of my cage to make myself think i'm a wild free bird by nature if you opened the door i'd not fly out but would hop meekly back to my perch and fall to smoothing my feathers tell me some more about victor dorn i told you he isn't fit to talk about said martha do you know they say now that he is carrying on with that shameless brazen thing who writes for his paper that selma gordon selma gordon echoed jane her brows came down in a gesture reminiscent of her father and there was a disagreeable expression about her mouth and in her light brown eyes who's selma gordon she makes speeches and writes articles against rich people and oh she's horrid pretty no a scrawny black thing the men some of them say she's got a kind of uncanny fascination some even insist that she's beautiful martha laughed beautiful how could a woman with black hair and a dark skin and no flesh on her bones be beautiful it has been known to happen said jane curtly is she one of the gordons mercy no cried martha galland she simply took the name of gordon that is her father did he was a russian peasant a jew and he fell in love with a girl who was of noble family a princess i think princess doesn't mean much in russia said jane sourly anyhow they ran away to this country and he worked in the rolling mill here and they both died and selma became a factory girl and then took to writing for the new day that's victor dorn's paper you know how romantic said jane sarcastically and now victor dorn's in love with her i didn't say that replied martha with a scandal smile jane hastings went to the window and gazed out into the garden martha resumed her habitual warm day existence sat rocking gently and fanning herself and looking leisurely about the room presently she said jane why don't you marry davy hull no answer he's got an independent income so there's no question of his marrying for money and there isn't any family anywhere that's better than his mighty few as good and he's dead in love with you jen with her back still turned jane snapped i'd rather marry victor dorn what outrageous things you do say cried martha i envy that black jewess that what's her name that selma gordon you don't even know them said martha jane wheeled round with a strange laugh don't i cried she i don't know anyone else she strode to her sister and tapped her lightly on the shoulder with the riding stick be careful cautioned martha you know how easily my flesh mars and i'm going to wear my low neck to night jane did not heed david hull is a bore and a fraud she said i tell you i'd rather marry victor dorn do be careful about my skin dear pleaded martha hugo'll be so put out if there's a mark on it he's very proud of my skin jane looked at her quizzically what a dear fat old rotter of a respectability it is to be sure said she and strode from the room and from the house her mood of perversity and defiance did not yield to a ten mile gallop over the gentle hills of that lovely part of indiana but held on through the afternoon and controlled her toilet for the ball she knew that every girl in town would appear at that most fashionable party of the summer season in the best clothing she could get together as she had several dresses from paris which she not without reason regarded as notable works of art the opportunity to outshine was hers the sort of opportunity she took pleasure in using to the uttermost as a rule but to be the best dressed woman at mrs bertram's party was too easy and too commonplace to be the worst dressed would call for courage of just the sort she prided herself on having also it would look original would cause talk would give her the coveted sense of achievement when she descended to show herself to her father and say good night to him she was certainly dressed by the same pattern that caused him to be talked about throughout that region her gown was mussed had been mended obviously in several places had not been in its best day becoming but this was not all her hair looked stringy and dishevelled she was delighted with herself except during an illness two years before never had she come so near to being downright homely martha will die of shame said she to herself and mrs bertram will spend the evening explaining me to everybody she did not definitely formulate the thought and i shall be the most talked about person of the evening but it was in her mind none the less her father always smoked his after dinner cigar in a little room just off the library it was filled up with the plain cheap furniture and the chromos and mottoes which he and his wife had bought when they first went to housekeeping in their early days of poverty and struggle on the south wall was a crude and cheap but startlingly large enlargement of an old daguerreotype of letitia hastings at twenty four the year after her marriage and the year before the birth of the oldest child robert called dock now piling up a fortune as an insider in the chicago brave game of wheat and pork which it is absurd to call gambling because gambling involves chance to smoke the one cigar the doctor allowed him old martin hastings always seated himself before this picture he found it and his thoughts the best company in the world just as he had found her silent self and her thoughts the best company in their twenty one years of married life as he sat there sometimes he thought of her of what they had been through together of the various advances in his fortune how this one had been made near such and such anniversary and that one between two other anniversaries and what he had said to her and what she had said to him again perhaps oftener he did not think of her directly any more than he had thought of her when they sat together evening after evening year in and year out through those twenty one years of contented and prosperous life as jane entered he seated back to the door said about that there dorn damage suit jane started caught her breath really it was uncanny this continual thrusting of victor dorn at her it wasn't so bad as it looked continued her father he was speaking in the quiet voice quiet and old and sad he always used when seated before the picture you see jenny in them days also in presence of the picture he lapsed completely into the dialect of his youth in them days the railroad was teetering and i couldn't tell which way things'd jump every cent counted i understand perfectly father said jane her hands on his shoulders from behind she felt immensely relieved she did not realize that every doer of a mean act always has an excellent excuse for it then afterwards the old man went on the family was getting along so well the boy was working steady and making good money and pushing ahead and i was afeared i'd do harm instead of good it's mighty dangerous jen to give money sudden to folks that ain't used to it i've seen many a smash up come that way and your ma she thought so too kind of the kind of was advanced hesitatingly with an apologetic side glance at the big crayon portrait but jane was entirely convinced she was average human therefore she believed what she wished to believe you were quite right father said she i knew you couldn't do a bad thing wouldn't deliberately strike at weak helpless people and now it can be straightened out and the dorns will be all the better for not having been tempted in the days when it might have ruined them she had walked round where her"
