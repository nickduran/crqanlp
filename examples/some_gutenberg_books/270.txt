"1" "would come when the horrors of war were flickering through the quiet country side where you were cradled and bred but where the memory of you had long been dim folk would run together clamorous palsied with fear and among the terror stricken groups would figure certain aunts what hope is left us they would ask themselves save in the clemency of the general the mysterious invincible general of whom men tell such romantic tales and the army would march in and the guns would rattle and leap along the village street and last of all you you the general the fabled hero you would enter on your coal black charger your pale set face seamed by an interesting sabre cut and then but every boy has rehearsed this familiar piece a score of times you are magnanimous in fine that goes without saying you have a coal black horse and a sabre cut and you can afford to be very magnanimous but all the same you give them a good talking to this pleasant conceit simply ravished my soul for some twenty minutes and then the old sense of injury began to well up afresh and to call for new plasters and soothing syrups this time i took refuge in happy thoughts of the sea the sea was my real sphere after all on the sea in especial you could combine distinction with lawlessness whereas the army seemed to be always weighted by a certain plodding submission to discipline to be sure by all accounts the life was at first a rough one but just then i wanted to suffer keenly i wanted to be a poor devil of a cabin boy kicked beaten and sworn at for a time perhaps some hint some inkling of my sufferings might reach their ears in due course the sloop or felucca would turn up it always did the rakish looking craft black of hull low in the water and bristling with guns the jolly roger flapping overhead and myself for sole commander by and by as usually happened an east indiaman would come sailing along full of relations not a necessary relation would be missing and the crew should walk the plank and the captain should dance from his own yardarm and then i would take the passengers in hand that miserable group of well known figures cowering on the quarter deck and then and then the same old performance the air thick with magnanimity in all the repertory of heroes none is more truly magnanimous than your pirate chief when at last i brought myself back from the future to the actual present i found that these delectable visions had helped me over a longer stretch of road than i had imagined and i looked around and took my bearings to the right of me was a long low building of grey stone new and yet not smugly so new and yet possessing distinction marked with a character that did not depend on lichen or on crumbling semi effacement of moulding and mullion strangers might have been puzzled to classify it to me an explorer from earliest years the place was familiar enough most folk called it the settlement others with quite sufficient conciseness for our neighbourhood spoke of them there fellows up by halliday's others again with a hint of derision named them the monks this last title i supposed to be intended for satire and knew to be fatuously wrong i was thoroughly acquainted with monks in books and well knew the cut of their long frocks their shaven polls and their fascinating big dogs with brandy bottles round their necks incessantly hauling happy travellers out of the snow the only dog at the settlement was an irish terrier and the good fellows who owned him and were owned by him in common wore clothes of the most nondescript order and mostly cultivated side whiskers i had wandered up there one day searching as usual for something i never found and had been taken in by them and treated as friend and comrade they had made me free of their ideal little rooms full of books and pictures and clean of the antimacassar taint they had shown me their chapel high hushed and faintly scented beautiful with a strange new beauty born both of what it had and what it had not that too familiar dowdiness of common places of worship they had also fed me in their dining hall where a long table stood on trestles plain to view and all the woodwork was natural unpainted healthily scrubbed and redolent of the forest it came from i brought away from that visit and kept by me for many days a sense of cleanness of the freshness that pricks the senses the freshness of cool spring water and the large swept spaces of the rooms the red tiles and the oaken settles suggested a comfort that had no connexion with padded upholstery on this particular morning i was in much too unsociable a mind for paying friendly calls still something in the aspect of the place harmonised with my humour and i worked my way round to the back where the ground after affording level enough for a kitchen garden broke steeply away both the word gothic and the thing itself were still unknown to me yet doubtless the architecture of the place consistent throughout accounted for its sense of comradeship in my hour of disheartenment as i mused there with the low grey purposeful looking building before me and thought of my pleasant friends within and what good times they always seemed to be having and how they larked with the irish terrier whose footing was one of a perfect equality i thought of a certain look in their faces as if they had a common purpose and a business and were acting under orders thoroughly recognised and understood i remembered too something that martha had told me about these same fellows doing a power o good and other hints i had collected vaguely of renouncements rules self denials and the like thereupon out of the depths of my morbid soul swam up a new and fascinating idea and at once the career of arms seemed over acted and stale and piracy as a profession flat and unprofitable this then or something like it should be my vocation and my revenge a severer line of business perhaps such as i had read of something that included black bread and a hair shirt there should be vows too irrevocable blood curdling vows and an iron grating this iron grating was the most necessary feature of all for i intended that on the other side of it my relations should range themselves i mentally ran over the catalogue and saw that the whole gang was present all in their proper places a sad eyed row combined in tristful appeal we see our error now they would say we were always dull dogs slow to catch especially in those akin to us the finer qualities of soul we misunderstood you misappreciated you and we own up to it and now alas my dear friends i would strike in here waving towards them an ascetic hand one of the emaciated sort that lets the light shine through at the finger tips alas you come too late this conduct is fitting and meritorious on your part and indeed i always expected it of you sooner or later but the die is cast and you may go home again and bewail at your leisure this too tardy repentance of yours for me i am vowed and dedicated and my relations henceforth are austerity and holy works once a month should you wish it it shall be your privilege to come and gaze at me through this very solid grating but whack a well aimed clod of garden soil whizzing just past my ear starred on a tree trunk behind spattering me with dirt the present came back to me in a flash and i nimbly took cover behind the trees realising that the enemy was up and abroad with ambuscades alarms and thrilling sallies it was the gardener's boy i knew well enough a red proletariat who hated me just because i was a gentleman hastily picking up a nice sticky clod in one hand with the other i delicately projected my hat beyond the shelter of the tree trunk i had not fought with red skins all these years for nothing as i had expected another clod of the first class for size and stickiness took my poor hat full in the centre then ajax like shouting terribly i issued from shelter and discharged my ammunition woe then for the gardener's boy who unprepared skipping in premature triumph took the clod full in his stomach he the foolish one witless on whose side the gods were fighting that day discharged yet other missiles wavering and wide of the mark for his wind had been taken with the first clod and he shot wildly as one already desperate and in flight i got another clod in at short range we clinched on the brow of the hill and rolled down to the bottom together when he had shaken himself free and regained his legs he trotted smartly off in the direction of his mother's cottage but over his shoulder he discharged at me both imprecation and deprecation menace mixed up with an under current of tears but as for me i made off smartly for the road my frame tingling my head high with never a backward look at the settlement of suggestive aspect or at my well planned future which lay in fragments around it life had its jollities then life was action contest victory the present was rosy once more surprises lurked on every side and i was beginning to feel villainously hungry just as i gained the road a cart came rattling by and i rushed for it caught the chain that hung below and swung thrillingly between the dizzy wheels choked and blinded with delicious smelling dust the world slipping by me like a streaky ribbon below till the driver licked at me with his whip and i had to descend to earth again abandoning the beaten track i then struck homewards through the fields not that the way was very much shorter but rather because on that route one avoided the bridge and had to splash through the stream and get refreshingly wet bridges were made for narrow folk for people with aims and vocations which compelled abandonment of many of life's highest pleasures truly wise men called on each element alike to minister to their joy and while the touch of sun bathed air the fragrance of garden soil the ductible qualities of mud and the spark whirling rapture of playing with fire had each their special charm they did not overlook the bliss of getting their feet wet as i came forth on the common harold broke out of an adjoining copse and ran to meet me the morning rain clouds all blown away from his face he had made a new squirrel stick it seemed made it all himself melted the lead and everything i examined the instrument critically and pronounced it absolutely magnificent as we passed in at our gate the girls were distantly visible gardening with a zeal in cheerful contrast to their heartsick lassitude of the morning there's bin another letter come to day harold explained and the hamper got joggled about on the journey and the presents worked down into the straw and all over the place one of em turned up inside the cold duck and that's why they weren't found at first and edward said thanks awfully i did not see martha again until we were all re assembled at tea time when she seemed red eyed and strangely silent neither scolding nor finding fault with anything instead she was very kind and thoughtful with jams and things feverishly pressing unwonted delicacies on us who wanted little pressing enough then suddenly when i was busiest she disappeared and charlotte whispered me presently that she had heard her go to her room and lock herself in this struck me as a funny sort of proceeding mutabile semper she stood on the other side of the garden fence and regarded me gravely as i came down the road then she said hi o and i responded hullo and pulled up somewhat nervously to tell the truth the encounter was not entirely unexpected on my part the previous sunday i had seen her in church and after service it had transpired who she was this new comer and what aunt she was staying with that morning a volunteer had been called for to take a note to the parsonage and rather to my own surprise i had found myself stepping forward with alacrity while the others had become suddenly absorbed in various pursuits or had sneaked unobtrusively out of view certainly i had not yet formed any deliberate plan of action yet i suppose i recollected that the road to the parsonage led past her aunt's garden she began the conversation while i hopped backwards and forwards over the ditch feigning a careless ease saw you in church on sunday she said only you looked different then all dressed up and your hair quite smooth and brushed up at the sides and oh so shiny what do they put on it to make it shine like that don't you hate having your hair brushed she ran on without waiting for an answer how your boots squeaked when you came down the aisle when mine squeak i walk in all the puddles till they stop think i'll get over the fence this she proceeded to do in a businesslike way while with my hands deep in my pockets i regarded her movements with silent interest as those of some strange new animal i've been gardening she explained when she had joined me but i didn't like it there's so many worms about to day i hate worms wish they'd keep out of the way when i'm digging oh i like worms when i'm digging i replied heartily seem to make things more lively don't they she reflected shouldn't mind em so much if they were warm and dry she said but here she shivered and somehow i liked her for it though if it had been my own flesh and blood hoots of derision would have instantly assailed her from worms we passed naturally enough to frogs and thence to pigs aunts gardeners rocking horses and other fellow citizens of our common kingdom in five minutes we had each other's confidences and i seemed to have known her for a lifetime somehow on the subject of one's self it was easier to be frank and communicative with her than with one's female kin it must be i supposed because she was less familiar with one's faulty tattered past i was watching you as you came along the road she said presently and you had your head down and your hands in your pockets and you weren't throwing stones at anything or whistling or jumping over things and i thought perhaps you'd bin scolded or got a stomach ache no i answered shyly it wasn't that fact is i was i often but it's a secret there i made an error in tactics that enkindling word set her dancing round me half beseeching half imperious oh do tell it me she cried you must i'll never tell anyone else at all i vow and declare i won't her small frame wriggled with emotion and with imploring eyes she jigged impatiently just in front of me her hair was tumbled bewitchingly on her shoulders and even the loss of a front tooth a loss incidental to her age seemed but to add a piquancy to her face you won't care to hear about it i said wavering besides i can't explain exactly i think i won't tell you but all the time i knew i should have to but i do care she wailed plaintively i didn't think you'd be so unkind this would never do that little downward tug at either corner of the mouth i knew the symptom only too well it's like this i began stammeringly this bit of road here up as far as that corner you know it's a horrid dull bit of road i'm always having to go up and down it and i know it so well and i'm so sick of it so whenever i get to that corner i just well i go right off to another place what sort of a place she asked looking round her gravely of course it's just a place i imagine i went on hurriedly and rather shamefacedly but it's an awfully nice place the nicest place you ever saw and i always go off there in church or during joggraphy lessons i'm sure it's not nicer than my home she cried patriotically oh you ought to see my home it's lovely we've got yes it is ever so much nicer i interrupted i mean i went on apologetically of course i know your home's beautiful and all that but this must be nicer cos if you want anything at all you've only got to want it and you can have it that sounds jolly she murmured tell me more about it please tell me how you get there first i don't quite know exactly i replied i just go but generally it begins by well you're going up a broad clear river in a sort of a boat you're not rowing or anything you're just moving along and there's beautiful grass meadows on both sides and the river's very full quite up to the level of the grass and you glide along by the edge and the people are haymaking there and playing games and walking about and they shout to you and you shout back to them and they bring you things to eat out of their baskets and let you drink out of their bottles and some of em are the nice people you read about in books and so at last you come to the palace steps great broad marble steps reaching right down to the water and there at the steps you find every sort of boat you can imagine schooners and punts and row boats and little men of war and you have any sort of boating you want to rowing or sailing or shoving about in a punt i'd go sailing she said decidedly and i'd steer no you'd have to steer and i'd sit about on the deck no i wouldn't though i'd row at least i'd make you row and i'd steer and then we'd oh no i'll tell you what we'd do we'd just sit in a punt and dabble of course we'll do just what you like i said hospitably but already i was beginning to feel my liberty of action somewhat curtailed by this exigent visitor i had so rashly admitted into my sanctum i don't think we'd boat at all she finally decided it's always so wobbly where do you come to next you go up the steps i continued and in at the door and the very first place you come to is the chocolate room she brightened up at this and i heard her murmur with gusto chocolate room it's got every sort of chocolate you can think of i went on soft chocolate with sticky stuff inside white and pink what girls like and hard shiny chocolate that cracks when you bite it and takes such a nice long time to suck i like the soft stuff best she said cos you can eat such a lot more of it this was to me a new aspect of the chocolate question and i regarded her with interest and some respect with us chocolate was none too common a thing and whenever we happened to come by any we resorted to the quaintest devices in order to make it last out still legends had reached us of children who actually had from time to time as much chocolate as they could possibly eat and here apparently was one of them you can have all the creams i said magnanimously and i'll eat the hard sticks cos i like em best oh but you mustn't she cried impetuously you must eat the same as i do it isn't nice to want to eat different i'll tell you what you must give me all the chocolate and then i'll give you i'll give you what you ought to have oh all right i said in a subdued sort of way it seemed a little hard to be put under a sentimental restriction like this in one's own chocolate room in the next room you come to i proceeded there's fizzy drinks there's a marble slab business all round the room and little silver taps and you just turn the right tap and have any kind of fizzy drink you want what fizzy drinks are there she inquired oh all sorts i answered hastily hurrying on she might restrict my eatables but i'd be hanged if i was going to have her meddle with my drinks then you go down the corridor and at the back of the palace there's a great big park the finest park you ever saw and there's ponies to ride on and carriages and carts and a little railway all complete engine and guard's van and all and you work it yourself and you can go first class or in the van or on the engine just whichever you choose i'd go on the engine she murmured dreamily no i wouldn't i'd then there's all the soldiers i struck in really the line had to be drawn somewhere and i could not have my railway system disorganised and turned upside down by a mere girl there's any quantity of em fine big soldiers and they all belong to me and a row of brass cannons all along the terrace and every now and then i give the order and they fire off all the guns no they don't she interrupted hastily i won't have em fire off any guns you must tell em not to i hate guns and as soon as they begin firing i shall run right away but but that's what they're there for i protested aghast i don't care she insisted they mustn't do it they can walk about behind me if they like and talk to me and carry things but they mustn't fire off any guns i was sadly conscious by this time that in this brave palace of mine wherein i was wont to swagger daily irresponsible and unquestioned i was rapidly becoming so to speak a mere lodger the idea of my fine big soldiers being told off to carry things i was not inclined to tell her any more though there still remained plenty more to tell any other boys there she asked presently in a casual sort of way oh yes i unguardedly replied nice chaps too we'll have great then i recollected myself we'll play with them of course i went on but you are going to be my friend aren't you and you'll come in my boat and we'll travel in the guard's van together and i'll stop the soldiers firing off their guns but she looked mischievously away and do what i would i could not get her to promise just then the striking of the village clock awoke within me another clamorous timepiece reminding me of mid day mutton a good half mile away and of penalties and curtailments attaching to a late appearance we took a hurried farewell of each other and before we parted i got from her an admission that she might be gardening again that afternoon if only the worms would be less aggressive and give her a chance remember i said as i turned to go you mustn't tell anybody about what i've been telling you she appeared to hesitate swinging one leg to and fro while she regarded me sideways with half shut eyes it's a dead secret i said artfully a secret between us two and nobody knows it except ourselves then she promised nodding violently big eyed her mouth pursed up small the delight of revelation and the bliss of possessing a secret run each other very close but the latter generally wins for a time i had passed the mutton stage and was weltering in warm rice pudding before i found leisure to pause and take in things generally and then a glance in the direction of the window told me to my dismay that it was raining hard this was annoying in every way for even if it cleared up later the worms i knew well from experience would be offensively numerous and frisky sulkily i said grace and accompanied the others upstairs to the schoolroom where i got out my paint box and resolved to devote myself seriously to art which of late i had much neglected harold got hold of a sheet of paper and a pencil retired to a table in the corner squared his elbows and protruded his tongue literature had always been his form of artistic expression selina had a fit of the fidgets bred of the unpromising weather and instead of settling down to something on her own account must needs walk round and annoy us artists intent on embodying our conceptions of the ideal she had been looking over my shoulder some minutes before i knew of it or i would have had a word or two to say upon the subject i suppose you call that thing a ship she remarked contemptuously who ever heard of a pink ship hoo hoo i stifled my wrath knowing that in order to score properly it was necessary to keep a cool head there is a pink ship i observed with forced calmness lying in the toy shop window now you can go and look at it if you like d'you suppose you know more about ships than the fellows who make em selina baffled for the moment returned to the charge presently those are funny things too she observed s'pose they're meant to be trees but they're blue they are trees i replied with severity and they are blue they've got to be blue cos you stole my gamboge last week so i can't mix up any green didn't steal your gamboge declared selina haughtily edging away however in the direction of harold and i wouldn't tell lies either if i was you about a dirty little bit of gamboge i preserved a discreet silence after all i knew she knew she stole my gamboge the moment harold became conscious of selina's stealthy approach he dropped his pencil and flung himself flat upon the table protecting thus his literary efforts from chilling criticism by the interposed thickness of his person from somewhere in his interior proceeded a heart rending compound of squeal and whistle as of escaping steam long drawn ear piercing unvarying in note i only just want to see protested selina struggling to uproot his small body from the scrawl it guarded but harold clung limpet like to the table edge and his shrill protest continued to deafen humanity and to threaten even the serenities of olympus the time seemed come for a demonstration in force personally i cared little what soul outpourings of harold were pirated by selina she was pretty sure to get hold of them sooner or later and indeed i rather welcomed the diversion as favourable to the undisturbed pursuit of art but the clannishness of sex has its unwritten laws boys as such are sufficiently put upon maltreated trodden under as it is should they fail to hang together in perilous times what disasters what ignominies may not be looked for possibly even an extinction of the tribe i dropped my paint brush and sailed shouting into the fray the result for a short space hung dubious there is a period of life when the difference of a year or two in age far outweighs the minor advantage of sex then the gathers of selina's frock came away with a sound like the rattle of distant musketry and this calamity it was rather than mere brute compulsion that quelled her indomitable spirit the female tongue is mightier than the sword as i soon had good reason to know when selina her riven garment held out at length avenged her discomfiture with the greek fire of personalities and abuse every black incident in my short but not stainless career every error every folly every penalty ignobly suffered were paraded before me as in a magic lantern show the information however was not particularly new to me and the effect was staled by previous rehearsals besides a victory remains a victory whatever the moral character of the triumphant general harold chuckled and crowed as he dropped from the table revealing the document over which so many gathers had sighed their short lives out you can read it if you like he said to me gratefully it's only a death letter it had never been possible to say what harold's particular amusement of the hour might turn out to be one thing only was certain that it would be something improbable unguessable not to be foretold who for instance in search of relaxation would ever dream of choosing the drawing up of a testamentary disposition of property yet this was"
