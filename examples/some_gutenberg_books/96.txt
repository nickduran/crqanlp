horn himself was often with his employer as he enjoyed the latter's complete confidence and owing to his early medical training was well fitted to act as a competent assistant but he was often barred from the workshop and at such times was much with virginia the two took long walks through the untouched jungle exploring their little island and never failing to find some new and wonderful proof of nature's creative power among its flora and fauna what a marvellous thing is creation exclaimed virginia as she and von horn paused one day to admire a tropical bird of unusually brilliant plumage how insignificant is man's greatest achievement beside the least of nature's works and yet replied von horn man shall find nature's secret some day what a glorious accomplishment for him who first succeeds can you imagine a more glorious consummation of a man's life work your father's for example the girl looked at von horn closely dr von horn she said pride has restrained me from asking what was evidently intended that i should not know for years my father has been interested in an endeavor to solve the mystery of life that he would ever attempt to utilize the secret should he have been so fortunate as to discover it had never occurred to me i mean that he should try to usurp the functions of the creator i could never have believed but my knowledge of him coupled with what you have said and the extreme lengths to which he has gone to maintain absolute secrecy for his present experiments can only lead to one inference and that that his present work if successful would have results that would not be countenanced by civilized society or government am i right von horn had attempted to sound the girl that he might if possible discover her attitude toward the work in which her father and he were engaged he had succeeded beyond his hopes for he had not intended that she should guess so much of the truth as she had should her interest in the work have proved favorable it had been his intention to acquaint her fully with the marvellous success which already had attended their experiments and to explain their hopes and plans for the future for he had seen how her father's attitude had hurt her and hoped to profit himself by reposing in her the trust and confidence that her father denied her and so it was that her direct question left him floundering in a sea of embarrassment for to tell her the truth now would gain him no favor in her eyes while it certainly would lay him open to the suspicion and distrust of her father should he learn of it i cannot answer your question miss maxon he said finally for your father's strictest injunction has been that i divulge to no one the slightest happening within the court of mystery remember that i am in your father's employ and that no matter what my personal convictions may be regarding the work he has been doing i may only act with loyalty to his lightest command while i remain upon his payroll that you are here he added is my excuse for continuing my connection with certain things of which my conscience does not approve the girl glanced at him quickly she did not fully understand the motive for his final avowal and a sudden intuition kept her from questioning him she had learned to look upon von horn as a very pleasant companion and a good friend she was not quite certain that she would care for any change in their relations but his remark had sowed the seed of a new thought in her mind as he had intended that it should when von horn returned to the court of mystery he narrated to professor maxon the gist of his conversation with virginia wishing to forestall anything which the girl might say to her father that would give him an impression that von horn had been talking more than he should professor maxon listened to the narration in silence when von horn had finished he cautioned him against divulging to virginia anything that took place within the inner campong she is only a child he said and would not understand the importance of the work we are doing all that she would be able to see is the immediate moral effect of these experiments upon the subjects themselves she would not look into the future and appreciate the immense advantage to mankind that must accrue from a successful termination of our research the future of the world will be assured when once we have demonstrated the possibility of the chemical production of a perfect race number one for example suggested von horn professor maxon glanced at him sharply levity doctor is entirely out of place in the contemplation of the magnificent work i have already accomplished said the professor tartly i admit that number one leaves much to be desired much to be desired but number two shows a marked advance along certain lines and i am sure that tomorrow will divulge in experiment number three such strides as will forever silence any propensity toward scoffing which you may now entertain forgive me professor von horn hastened to urge i did not intend to deride the wonderful discoveries which you have made but it is only natural that we should both realize that number one is not beautiful to one another we may say what we would not think of suggesting to outsiders professor maxon was mollified by this apology and turned to resume his watch beside a large coffin shaped vat for a while von horn was silent there was that upon his mind which he had wished to discuss with his employer since months ago but the moment had never arrived which seemed at all propitious nor did it appear likely ever to arrive so the doctor decided to broach the subject now as being psychologically as favorable a time as any your daughter is far from happy professor he said nor do i feel that surrounded as we are by semi savage men she is entirely safe professor maxon looked up from his vigil by the vat eyeing von horn closely well he asked it seemed to me that had i a closer relationship i might better assist in adding to her happiness and safety in short professor i should like your permission to ask virginia to marry me there had been no indication in von horn's attitude toward the girl that he loved her that she was beautiful and intelligent could not be denied and so it was small wonder that she might appeal strongly to any man but von horn was quite evidently not of the marrying type for years he had roved the world in search of adventure and excitement just why he had left america and his high place in the navy he never had divulged nor why it was that for seven years he had not set his foot upon ground which lay beneath the authority of uncle sam sing lee who stood just without the trap door through which he was about to pass professor maxon's evening meal to him could not be blamed for overhearing the conversation though it may have been culpable in him in making no effort to divulge his presence and possibly equally unpraiseworthy as well as lacking in romance to attribute the doctor's avowal to his knowledge of the heavy chest as professor maxon eyed the man before replying to his abrupt request von horn noted a strange and sudden light in the older man's eyes a something which he never before had seen there and which caused an uncomfortable sensation to creep over him a manner of bristling that was akin either to fear or horror von horn could not tell which then the professor arose from his seat and came very close to the younger man until his face was only a few inches from von horn's doctor he whispered in a strange tense voice you are mad you do not know what you ask virginia is not for such as you tell me that she does not know of your feelings toward her tell me that she does not reciprocate your love tell me the truth man professor maxon seized von horn roughly by both shoulders his glittering eyes glaring terribly into the other's i have never spoken to her of love professor replied von horn quietly nor do i know what her sentiments toward me may be nor do i understand sir what objections you may have to me i am of a very old and noble family his tone was haughty but respectful professor maxon released his hold upon his assistant breathing a sigh of relief i am glad he said that it has gone no further for it must not be i have other nobler aspirations for my daughter she must wed a perfect man none such now exists it remains for me to bring forth the ideal mate for her nor is the time far distant a few more weeks and we shall see such a being as i have long dreamed again the queer light flickered for a moment in the once kindly and jovial eyes of the scientist von horn was horrified he was a man of little sentiment he could in cold blood have married this girl for the wealth he knew that she would inherit but the thought that she was to be united with such a thing lord it is horrible and his mind pictured the fearful atrocity which was known as number one without a word he turned and left the campong a moment later sing's knock aroused professor maxon from the reverie into which he had fallen and he stepped to the trap door to receive his evening meal 3 beauty and the beast one day about two weeks later von horn and the professor were occupied closely with their work in the court of mystery developments were coming in riotous confusion a recent startling discovery bade fare to simplify and expedite the work far beyond the fondest dreams of the scientist von horn's interest in the marvellous results that had been obtained was little short of the professor's but he foresaw a very different outcome of it all and by day never moved without a gun at either hip and by night both of them were beside him sing lee the noonday meal having been disposed of set forth with rod string and bait to snare gulls upon the beach he moved quietly through the jungle his sharp eyes and ears always alert for anything that might savor of the unusual and so it was that he saw the two men upon the beach while they did not see him at all they were bududreen and the same tall malay whom sing had seen twice before once in splendid raiment and commanding the pirate prahu and again as a simple boatman come to the ithaca to trade but without the goods to carry out his professed intentions the two squatted on the beach at the edge of the jungle a short distance above the point at which sing had been about to emerge when he discovered them so that it was but the work of a moment or two for the chinaman to creep stealthily through the dense underbrush to a point directly above them and not three yards from where they conversed in low tones yet sufficiently loud that sing missed not a word i tell you bududreen that it will be quite safe the tall malay was saying you yourself tell me that none knows of the whereabouts of these white men and if they do not return your word will be accepted as to their fate your reward will be great if you bring the girl to me and if you doubt the loyalty of any of your own people a kris will silence them as effectually as it will silence the white men it is not fear of the white men oh rajah muda saffir that deters me said bududreen but how shall i know that after i have come to your country with the girl i shall not myself be set upon and silenced with a golden kris there be many that will be jealous of the great service i have done for the mighty rajah muda saffir knew perfectly well that bududreen had but diplomatically expressed a fear as to his own royal trustworthiness but it did not anger him since the charge was not a direct one but what he did not know was of the heavy chest and bududreen's desire to win the price of the girl and yet be able to save for himself a chance at the far greater fortune which he knew lay beneath that heavy oaken lid both men had arisen now and were walking across the beach toward a small native canoe in which muda saffir had come to the meeting place they were out of earshot before either spoke again so that what further passed between them sing could not even guess but he had heard enough to confirm the suspicions he had entertained for a long while he did not fish for gulls that day bududreen and muda saffir stood talking upon the beach and the chinaman did not dare venture forth for fear they might suspect that he had overheard them if old sing lee knew his malays he was also wise enough to give them credit for knowing their chinamen so he waited quietly in hiding until muda saffir had left and bududreen returned to camp professor maxon and von horn were standing over one of the six vats that were arranged in two rows down the center of the laboratory the professor had been more communicative and agreeable today than for some time past and their conversation had assumed more of the familiarity that had marked it during the first month of their acquaintance at singapore and what of these first who are so imperfect asked von horn you cannot take them into civilization nor would it be right to leave them here upon this island what will you do with them professor maxon pondered the question for a moment i have given the matter but little thought he said at length they are but the accidents of my great work it is unfortunate that they are as they are but without them i could have never reached the perfection that i am sure we are to find here and he tapped lovingly upon the heavy glass cover of the vat before which he stood and this is but the beginning there can be no more mistakes now though i doubt if we can ever improve upon that which is so rapidly developing here again he passed his long slender hand caressingly over the coffin like vat at the head of which was a placard bearing the words number thirteen but the others professor insisted von horn we must decide already they have become a problem of no small dimensions yesterday number five desired some plantains that i had given to number seven i tried to reason with him but as you know he is mentally defective and for answer he rushed at number seven to tear the coveted morsel from him the result was a battle royal that might have put to shame two bengal tigers twelve is tractable and intelligent with his assistance and my bull whip i succeeded in separating them before either was killed your greatest error was in striving at first for such physical perfection you have overdone it with the result that the court of mystery is peopled by a dozen brutes of awful muscularity and scarcely enough brain among the dozen to equip three properly they are as they are replied the professor i shall do for them what i can when i am gone they must look to themselves i can see no way out of it what you have given you may take away said von horn in a low tone professor maxon shuddered those three horrid days in the workshop at ithaca flooded his memory with all the gruesome details he had tried for so many months to forget the haunting ghosts of the mental anguish that had left him an altered man so altered that there were times when he had feared for his sanity no no he almost shouted it would be murder they are they are things interrupted von horn they are not human they are not even beast they are terrible soulless creatures you have no right to permit them to live longer than to substantiate your theory none but us knows of their existence no other need know of their passing it must be done they are a constant and growing menace to us all but most of all to your daughter a cunning look came into the professor's eyes i understand he said the precedent once established all must perish by its edict even those which may not be grotesque or bestial even this perfect one and he touched again the vat and thus you would rid yourself of rival suitors but no he went on in a high trembling voice i shall not be led to thus compromise myself and be thwarted in my cherished plan be this one what he may he shall wed my daughter the man had raised himself upon his toes as he reached his climax his clenched hand was high above his head his voice fairly thundered out the final sentence and with the last word he brought his fist down upon the vat before him in his eyes blazed the light of unchained madness von horn was a brave man but he shuddered at the maniacal ferocity of the older man and shrank back the futility of argument was apparent and he turned and left the workshop sing lee was late that night in fact he did not return from his fruitless quest for gulls until well after dark nor would he vouchsafe any explanation of the consequent lateness of supper nor could he be found shortly after the evening meal when virginia sought him not until the camp was wrapped in the quiet of slumber did sing lee return stealthy and mysterious to creep under cover of a moonless night to the door of the workshop how he gained entrance only sing lee knows but a moment later there was a muffled crash of broken glass within the laboratory and the chinaman had slipped out relocked the door and scurried to his nearby shack but there was no occasion for his haste no other ear than his had heard the sound within the workshop it was almost nine the following morning before professor maxon and von horn entered the laboratory scarcely had the older man passed the doorway than he drew up his hands in horrified consternation vat number thirteen lay dashed to the floor the glass cover was broken to a million pieces a sticky brownish substance covered the matting professor maxon hid his face in his hands god he cried it is all ruined three more days would have look cried von horn it is not too soon professor maxon mustered courage to raise his eyes from his hands and there he beheld seated in a far corner of the room a handsome giant physically perfect the creature looked about him in a dazed uncomprehending manner a great question was writ large upon his intelligent countenance professor maxon stepped forward and took him by the hand come he said and led him toward a smaller room off the main workshop the giant followed docilely his eyes roving about the room the pitiful questioning still upon his handsome features von horn turned toward the campong virginia deserted by all even the faithful sing who cheated of his sport on the preceding day had again gone to the beach to snare gulls became restless of the enforced idleness and solitude for a time she wandered about the little compound which had been reserved for the whites but tiring of this she decided to extend her stroll beyond the palisade a thing which she had never before done unless accompanied by von horn a thing both he and her father had cautioned her against what danger can there be she thought we know that the island is uninhabited by others than ourselves and that there are no dangerous beasts and anyway there is no one now who seems to care what becomes of me unless unless i wonder if he does care i wonder if i care whether or not he cares oh dear i wish i knew and as she soliloquized she wandered past the little clearing and into the jungle that lay behind the campong as von horn and professor maxon talked together in the laboratory before the upsetting of vat number thirteen a grotesque and horrible creature had slunk from the low shed at the opposite side of the campong until it had crouched at the flimsy door of the building in which the two men conversed for a while it listened intently but when von horn urged the necessity for dispatching certain terrible soulless creatures an expression of intermingled fear and hatred convulsed the hideous features and like a great grizzly it turned and lumbered awkwardly across the campong toward the easterly or back wall of the enclosure here it leaped futilely a half dozen times for the top of the palisade and then trembling and chattering in rage it ran back and forth along the base of the obstacle just as a wild beast in captivity paces angrily before the bars of its cage finally it paused to look once more at the senseless wood that barred its escape as though measuring the distance to the top then the eyes roamed about the campong to rest at last upon the slanting roof of the thatched shed which was its shelter presently a slow idea was born in the poor malformed brain the creature approached the shed he could just reach the saplings that formed the frame work of the roof like a huge sloth he drew himself to the roof of the structure from here he could see beyond the palisade and the wild freedom of the jungle called to him he did not know what it was but in its leafy wall he perceived many breaks and openings that offered concealment from the creatures who were plotting to take his life yet the wall was not fully six feet from him and the top of it at least five feet above the top of the shed those who had designed the campong had been careful to set this structure sufficiently far from the palisade to prevent its forming too easy an avenue of escape the creature glanced fearfully toward the workshop he remembered the cruel bull whip that always followed each new experiment on his part that did not coincide with the desires of his master and as he thought of von horn a nasty gleam shot his mismated eyes he tried to reach across the distance between the roof and the palisade and in the attempt lost his balance and nearly precipitated himself to the ground below cautiously he drew back still looking about for some means to cross the chasm one of the saplings of the roof protruding beyond the palm leaf thatch caught his attention with a single wrench he tore it from its fastenings extending it toward the palisade he discovered that it just spanned the gap but he dared not attempt to cross upon its single slender strand quickly he ripped off a half dozen other poles from the roof and laying them side by side formed a safe and easy path to freedom a moment more and he sat astride the top of the wall drawing the poles after him he dropped them one by one to the ground outside the campong then he lowered himself to liberty gathering the saplings under one huge arm he ran lumberingly into the jungle he would not leave evidence of the havoc he had wrought the fear of the bull whip was still strong upon him the green foliage closed about him and the peaceful jungle gave no sign of the horrid brute that roamed its shadowed mazes as von horn stepped into the campong his quick eye perceived the havoc that had been wrought with the roof at the east end of the shed quickly he crossed to the low structure within its compartments a number of deformed monsters squatted upon their haunches or lay prone upon the native mats that covered the floor as the man entered they looked furtively at the bull whip which trailed from his right hand and then glanced fearfully at one another as though questioning which was the malefactor on this occasion von horn ran his eyes over the hideous assemblage where is number one he asked directing his question toward a thing whose forehead gave greater promise of intelligence than any of his companions the one addressed shook his head von horn turned and made a circuit of the campong there was no sign of the missing one and no indication of any other irregularity than the demolished portion of the roof with an expression of mild concern upon his face he entered the workshop number one has escaped into the jungle professor he said professor maxon looked up in surprise but before he had an opportunity to reply a woman's scream shrill with horror smote upon their startled ears von horn was the first to reach the campong of the whites professor maxon was close behind him and the faces of both were white with apprehension the enclosure was deserted not even sing was there without a word the two men sprang through the gateway and raced for the jungle in the direction from which that single haunting cry had come virginia maxon idling beneath the leafy shade of the tropical foliage became presently aware that she had wandered farther from the campong than she had intended the day was sultry and the heat even in the dense shade of the jungle oppressive slowly she retraced her steps her eyes upon the ground her mind absorbed in sad consideration of her father's increasing moodiness and eccentricity possibly it was this very abstraction which deadened her senses to the near approach of another at any rate the girl's first intimation that she was not alone came when she raised her eyes to look full into the horrid countenance of a fearsome monster which blocked her path toward camp the sudden shock brought a single involuntary scream from her lips and who can wonder the thing thrust so unexpectedly before her eyes was hideous in the extreme a great mountain of deformed flesh clothed in dirty white cotton pajamas its face was of the ashen hue of a fresh corpse while the white hair and pink eyes denoted the absence of pigment a characteristic of albinos one eye was fully twice the diameter of the other and an inch above the horizontal plane of its tiny mate the nose was but a gaping orifice above a deformed and twisted mouth the thing was chinless and its small foreheadless head surrounded its colossal body like a cannon ball on a hill top one arm was at least twelve inches longer than its mate which was itself long in proportion to the torso while the legs similarly mismated and terminating in huge flat feet that protruded laterally caused the thing to lurch fearfully from side to side as it lumbered toward the girl a sudden grimace lighted the frightful face as the grotesque eyes fell upon this new creature number one had never before seen a woman but the sight of this one awoke in the unplumbed depths of his soulless breast a great desire to lay his hands upon her she was very beautiful number one wished to have her for his very own nor would it be a difficult matter so fragile was she to gather her up in those great brute arms and carry her deep into the jungle far out of hearing of the bull whip man and the cold frowning one who was continually measuring and weighing number one and his companions the while he scrutinized them with those strange glittering eyes that frightened one even more than the cruel lash of the bull whip number one lurched forward his arms outstretched toward the horror stricken girl virginia tried to cry out again she tried to turn and run but the horror of her impending fate and the terror that those awful features induced left her paralyzed and helpless the thing was almost upon her now the mouth was wide in a hideous attempt to smile the great hands would grasp her in another second and then there was a sudden crashing of the underbrush behind her a yellow wrinkled face and a flying pig tail shot past her and the brave old sing lee grappled with the mighty monster that threatened her the battle was short short and terrible the valiant chinaman sought the ashen throat of his antagonist but his wiry sinewy muscles were as reeds beneath the force of"
