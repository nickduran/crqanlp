"1" "father to get lettuces for their sunday dinner the name of little benjamin's papa was old mr benjamin bunny the lettuces certainly were very fine peter did not eat anything he said he should like to go home presently he dropped half the onions little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear tree with a load of vegetables he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden they went along a little walk on planks under a sunny red brick wall the mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry stones they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny presently peter let the pocket handkerchief go again they got amongst flower pots and frames and tubs peter heard noises worse than ever his eyes were as big as lolly pops he was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner little benjamin took one look and then in half a minute less than no time he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket the cat got up and stretched herself and came and sniffed at the basket perhaps she liked the smell of onions anyway she sat down upon the top of the basket she sat there for five hours i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket because it was quite dark and because the smell of onions was fearful it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry the sun got round behind the wood and it was quite late in the afternoon but still the cat sat upon the basket at length there was a pitter patter pitter patter and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above the cat looked up and saw old mr benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace he was smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco and had a little switch in his hand he was looking for his son old mr bunny had no opinion whatever of cats he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat and cuffed it off the basket and kicked it into the greenhouse scratching off a handful of fur the cat was too much surprised to scratch back when old mr bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse he locked the door then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears and whipped him with the little switch then he took out his nephew peter then he took out the handkerchief of onions and marched out of the garden when mr mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs only the footmarks were too ridiculously little also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse locking the door upon the outside when peter got home his mother forgave him because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat cotton tail and peter folded up the pocket handkerchief and old mrs rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit tobacco the tale of two bad mice for w.m.l.w the little girl who had the doll's house once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's house it was red brick with white windows and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney it belonged to two dolls called lucinda and jane at least it belonged to lucinda but she never ordered meals jane was the cook but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought ready made in a box full of shavings there were two red lobsters and a ham a fish a pudding and some pears and oranges they would not come off the plates but they were extremely beautiful one morning lucinda and jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet presently there was a little scuffling scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirting board tom thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again tom thumb was a mouse a minute afterwards hunca munca his wife put her head out too and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal box the doll's house stood at the other side of the fire place tom thumb and hunca munca went cautiously across the hearthrug they pushed the front door it was not fast tom thumb and hunca munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining room then they squeaked with joy such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dolly chairs all so convenient tom thumb set to work at once to carve the ham it was a beautiful shiny yellow streaked with red the knife crumpled up and hurt him he put his finger in his mouth it is not boiled enough it is hard you have a try hunca munca hunca munca stood up in her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife it's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's said hunca munca the ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table let it alone said tom thumb give me some fish hunca munca hunca munca tried every tin spoon in turn the fish was glued to the dish then tom thumb lost his temper he put the ham in the middle of the floor and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel bang bang smash smash the ham flew all into pieces for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of tom thumb and hunca munca they broke up the pudding the lobsters the pears and the oranges as the fish would not come off the plate they put it into the red hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen but it would not burn either tom thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top there was no soot while tom thumb was up the chimney hunca munca had another disappointment she found some tiny canisters upon the dresser labelled rice coffee sago but when she turned them upside down there was nothing inside except red and blue beads then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could especially tom thumb he took jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom and he threw them out of the top floor window but hunca munca had a frugal mind after pulling half the feathers out of lucinda's bolster she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed with tom thumbs's assistance she carried the bolster downstairs and across the hearth rug it was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse hole but they managed it somehow then hunca munca went back and fetched a chair a book case a bird cage and several small odds and ends the book case and the bird cage refused to go into the mousehole hunca munca left them behind the coal box and went to fetch a cradle hunca munca was just returning with another chair when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing the mice rushed back to their hole and the dolls came into the nursery what a sight met the eyes of jane and lucinda lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared and jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled but neither of them made any remark the book case and the bird cage were rescued from under the coal box but hunca munca has got the cradle and some of lucinda's clothes she also has some useful pots and pans and several other things the little girl that the doll's house belonged to said i will get a doll dressed like a policeman but the nurse said i will set a mouse trap so that is the story of the two bad mice but they were not so very very naughty after all because tom thumb paid for everything he broke he found a crooked sixpence under the hearth rug and upon christmas eve he and hunca munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of lucinda and jane and very early every morning before anybody is awake hunca munca comes with her dust pan and her broom to sweep the dollies house the tale of mrs tiggy winkle for the real little lucie of newlands once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie who lived at a farm called little town she was a good little girl only she was always losing her pocket handkerchiefs one day little lucie came into the farm yard crying oh she did cry so i've lost my pocket handkin three handkins and a pinny have you seen them tabby kitten the kitten went on washing her white paws so lucie asked a speckled hen sally henny penny have you found three pocket handkins but the speckled hen ran into a barn clucking i go barefoot barefoot barefoot and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye and he flew over a stile and away lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little town a hill that goes up up into the clouds as though it had no top and a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her she ran along a steep path way up and up until little town was right away down below she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney presently she came to a spring bubbling out from the hillside some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water but the water was already running over for the can was no bigger than an egg cup and where the sand upon the path was wet there were footmarks of a very small person lucie ran on and on the path ended under a big rock the grass was short and green and there were clothes props cut from bracken stems with lines of plaited rushes and a heap of tiny clothes pins but no pocket handkerchiefs but there was something else a door straight into the hill and inside it some one was singing lily white and clean oh with little frills between oh smooth and hot red rusty spot never here be seen oh lucie knocked once twice and interrupted the song a little frightened voice called out who's that lucie opened the door and what do you think there was inside the hill a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams just like any other farm kitchen only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it and the pots and pans were small and so was everything there there was a nice hot singey smell and at the table with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie her print gown was tucked up and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat her little black nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle and underneath her cap where lucie had yellow curls that little person had prickles who are you said lucie have you seen my pocket handkins the little person made a bob curtsey oh yes if you please'm my name is mrs tiggy winkle oh yes if you please'm i'm an excellent clear starcher and she took something out of the clothesbasket and spread it on the ironing blanket what's that thing said lucie that's not my pocket handkin oh no if you please'm that's a little scarlet waist coat belonging to cock robin and she ironed it and folded it and put it on one side then she took something else off a clothes horse that isn't my pinny said lucie oh no if you please'm that's a damask table cloth belonging to jenny wren look how it's stained with currant wine it's very bad to wash said mrs tiggy winkle mrs tiggy winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle and she fetched another hot iron from the fire there's one of my pocket handkins cried lucie and there's my pinny mrs tiggy winkle ironed it and goffered it and shook out the frills oh that is lovely said lucie and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny penny look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard she'll very soon go barefoot said mrs tiggy winkle why there's another hankersniff but it isn't mine it's red oh no if you please'm that one belongs to old mrs rabbit and it did so smell of onions i've had to wash it separately i can't get out that smell there's another one of mine said lucie what are those funny little white things that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten i only have to iron them she washes them herself there's my last pocket handkin said lucie and what are you dipping into the basin of starch they're little dicky shirt fronts belonging to tom titmouse most terrible particular said mrs tiggy winkle now i've finished my ironing i'm going to air some clothes what are these dear soft fluffy things said lucie oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl will their jackets take off asked lucie oh yes if you please'm look at the sheep mark on the shoulder and here's one marked for gatesgarth and three that come from little town they're always marked at washing said mrs tiggy winkle and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes small brown coats of mice and one velvety black moleskin waist coat and a red tail coat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit and a petticoat not marked that had gone lost in the washing and at last the basket was empty then mrs tiggy winkle made tea a cup for herself and a cup for lucie they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another mrs tiggy winkle's hand holding the tea cup was very very brown and very very wrinkly with the soap suds and all through her gown and her cap there were hairpins sticking wrong end out so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her when they had finished tea they tied up the clothes in bundles and lucie's pocket handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny and fastened with a silver safety pin and then they made up the fire with turf and came out and locked the door and hid the key under the door sill then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs tiggy winkle with the bundles of clothes all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny and she gave them their nice clean clothes and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs tiggy winkle so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile there was nothing left to carry except lucie's one little bundle lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand and then she turned to say good night and to thank the washer woman but what a very odd thing mrs tiggy winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill she was running running running up the hill and where was her white frilled cap and her shawl and her gown and her petticoat and how small she had grown and how brown and covered with prickles why mrs tiggy winkle was nothing but a hedgehog now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the stile but then how could she have found three clean pocket handkins and a pinny pinned with a silver safety pin and besides i have seen that door into the back of the hill called cat bells and besides _i_ am very well acquainted with dear mrs tiggy winkle the pie and the patty pan pussy cat sits by the fire how should she be fair in walks the little dog says pussy are you there how do you do mistress pussy mistress pussy how do you do i thank you kindly little dog i fare as well as you old rhyme once upon a time there was a pussy cat called ribby who invited a little dog called duchess to tea come in good time my dear duchess said ribby's letter and we will have something so very nice i am baking it in a pie dish a pie dish with a pink rim you never tasted anything so good and you shall eat it all _i_ will eat muffins my dear duchess wrote ribby i will come very punctually my dear ribby wrote duchess and then at the end she added i hope it isn't mouse and then she thought that did not look quite polite so she scratched out isn't mouse and changed it to i hope it will be fine and she gave her letter to the postman but she thought a great deal about ribby's pie and she read ribby's letter over and over again i am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse said duchess to herself i really couldn't couldn't eat mouse pie and i shall have to eat it because it is a party and my pie was going to be veal and ham a pink and white pie dish and so is mine just like ribby's dishes they were both bought at tabitha twitchit's duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it oh what a good idea why shouldn't i rush along and put my pie into ribby's oven when ribby isn't there ribby in the meantime had received duchess's answer and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come she popped her pie into the oven there were two ovens one above the other some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open ribby put the pie into the lower oven the door was very stiff the top oven bakes too quickly said ribby to herself ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth then she went out with a can to the well for water to fill up the kettle then she began to set the room in order for it was the sitting room as well as the kitchen when ribby had laid the table she went out down the field to the farm to fetch milk and butter when she came back she peeped into the bottom oven the pie looked very comfortable ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket to the village shop to buy a packet of tea a pound of lump sugar and a pot of marmalade and just at the same time duchess came out of her house at the other end of the village ribby met duchess half way down the street also carrying a basket covered with a cloth they only bowed to one another they did not speak because they were going to have a party as soon as duchess had got round the corner out of sight she simply ran straight away to ribby's house ribby went into the shop and bought what she required and came out after a pleasant gossip with cousin tabitha twitchit ribby went on to timothy baker's and bought the muffins then she went home there seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage as she was coming in at the front door but there was nobody there duchess in the meantime had slipped out at the back door it is a very odd thing that ribby's pie was not in the oven when i put mine in and i can't find it anywhere i have looked all over the house i put my pie into a nice hot oven at the top i could not turn any of the other handles i think that they are all shams said duchess but i wish i could have removed the pie made of mouse i cannot think what she has done with it i heard ribby coming and i had to run out by the back door duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for ribby and passed the time until the clock struck four ribby having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder went upstairs to change her dress she came downstairs again and made the tea and put the teapot on the hob she peeped again into the bottom oven the pie had become a lovely brown and it was steaming hot she sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog i am glad i used the bottom oven said ribby the top one would certainly have been very much too hot very punctually at four o'clock duchess started to go to the party at a quarter past four to the minute there came a most genteel little tap tappity is mrs ribston at home inquired duchess in the porch come in and how do you do my dear duchess cried ribby i hope i see you well quite well i thank you and how do you do my dear ribby said duchess i've brought you some flowers what a delicious smell of pie oh what lovely flowers yes it is mouse and bacon i think it wants another five minutes said ribby just a shade longer i will pour out the tea while we wait do you take sugar my dear duchess oh yes please my dear ribby and may i have a lump upon my nose with pleasure my dear duchess duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed how good that pie smells i do love veal and ham i mean to say mouse and bacon she dropped the sugar in confusion and had to go hunting under the tea table so did not see which oven ribby opened in order to get out the pie ribby set the pie upon the table there was a very savoury smell duchess came out from under the table cloth munching sugar and sat up on a chair i will first cut the pie for you i am going to have muffin and marmalade said ribby i think thought duchess to herself i think it would be wiser if i helped myself to pie though ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it what very small fine pieces it has cooked into i did not remember that i had minced it up so fine i suppose this is a quicker oven than my own the pie dish was emptying rapidly duchess had had four helps already and was fumbling with the spoon a little more bacon my dear duchess said ribby thank you my dear ribby i was only feeling for the patty pan the patty pan my dear duchess the patty pan that held up the pie crust said duchess blushing under her black coat oh i didn't put one in my dear duchess said ribby i don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse duchess fumbled with the spoon i can't find it she said anxiously there isn't a patty pan said ribby looking perplexed yes indeed my dear ribby where can it have gone to said duchess duchess looked very much alarmed and continued to scoop the inside of the pie dish i have only four patty pans and they are all in the cupboard duchess set up a howl i shall die i shall die i have swallowed a patty pan oh my dear ribby i do feel so ill it is impossible my dear duchess there was not a patty pan yes there was my dear ribby i am sure i have swallowed it let me prop you up with a pillow my dear duchess where do you think you feel it oh i do feel so ill all over me my dear ribby shall i run for the doctor oh yes yes fetch dr maggotty my dear ribby he is a pie himself he will certainly understand ribby settled duchess in an armchair before the fire and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor she found him at the smithy ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty pan dr maggotty hopped so fast that ribby had to run it was most conspicuous all the village could see that ribby was fetching the doctor but while ribby had been hunting for the doctor a curious thing had happened to duchess who had been left by herself sitting before the fire sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy how could i have swallowed it such a large thing as a patty pan she sat down again and stared mournfully at the grate the fire crackled and danced and something sizz z zled duchess started she opened the door of the top oven out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham and there stood a fine brown pie and through a hole in the top of the pie crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty pan duchess drew a long breath then i must have been eating mouse no wonder i feel ill but perhaps i should feel worse if i had really swallowed a patty pan duchess reflected what a very awkward thing to have to explain to ribby i think i will put my pie in the back yard and say nothing about it when i go home i will run round and take it away she put it outside the back door and sat down again by the fire and shut her eyes when ribby arrived with the doctor she seemed fast asleep i am feeling very much better said duchess waking up with a jump i am truly glad to hear it he has brought you a pill my dear duchess i think i should feel quite well if he only felt my pulse said duchess backing away from the magpie who sidled up with something in his beak it is only a bread pill you had much better take it drink a little milk my dear duchess i am feeling very much better my dear ribby said duchess do you not think that i had better go home before it gets dark perhaps it might be wise my dear duchess ribby and duchess said good bye affectionately and duchess started home half way up the lane she stopped and looked back ribby had gone in and shut her door duchess slipped through the fence and ran round to the back of ribby's house and peeped into the yard upon the roof of the pig stye sat dr maggotty and three jackdaws the jackdaws were eating piecrust and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty pan duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly when ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea things she found a pink and white pie dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard ribby stared with amazement did you ever see the like so there really was a patty pan but my patty pans are all in the kitchen cupboard well i never did next time i want to give a party i will invite cousin tabitha twitchit the tale of mr jeremy fisher for stephanie from cousin b once upon a time there was a frog called mr jeremy fisher he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond the water was all slippy sloppy in the larder and in the back passage but mr jeremy liked getting his feet wet nobody ever scolded him and he never caught a cold he was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain splashing in the pond i will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner said mr jeremy fisher if i catch more than five fish i will invite my friends mr alderman ptolemy tortoise and sir isaac newton the alderman however eats salad mr jeremy put on a mackintosh and a pair of
