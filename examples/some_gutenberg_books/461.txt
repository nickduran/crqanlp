"1" "a housemaid so was she known on this dull earth of ours but in heaven in the heaven of my imagination at all events she was of course a goddess how she managed to keep her disguise i never could understand to me she was so obviously dea certe the nimbus was so apparent yet no one seemed to see it but me i have heard her scolded as though she were any ordinary earthly housemaid and i have seen the butcher's boy trying to flirt with her without a touch of reverence maybe i understood because i saw her in that early hour of the morning when even the stony memnon sings in that mystical light of the young day when divine exiled things condemned to rough bondage through the noon are for a short magical hour their own celestial selves their unearthly glory as yet unhidden by any earthly disguise neither fairies nor fauns dryads nor nymphs of the forest pools have really passed away from the world you have only to get up early enough to meet them in the meadows they rarely venture abroad after six all day long they hide in uncouth enchanted forms they change maybe to a field of turnips and i have seen a farmer priding himself on a flock of sheep that i knew were really a most merry company of dryads and fauns in disguise i had but to make the sign of the cross sprinkle some holy water upon them and call them by their sweet secret names and the whole rout had been off to the woods with mad gambol and song before the eyes of the astonished farmer it was so with hebe she was really a little gold haired blue eyed dryad whose true home was a wild white cherry tree that grew in some scattered woodland behind the old country house of my boyhood in spring time how that naughty tree used to flash its silver nakedness of blossom for miles across the furze and scattered birches i might have known it was hebe alas it no longer bares its bosom with so dazzling a prodigality for it is many a day since it was uprooted the little dryad long since fled away weeping fled away said evil tongues fled away to the town well do i remember our last meeting returning home one evening i met her at the lodge gate hurrying away our loves had been discovered and my mother had shuddered to think that so pagan a thing had lived so long in a christian house i vowed ah what did i not vow and then we stole sadly together to comfort our aching hearts under cover of the woodland for the last time the wild cherry tree bloomed wonderful blossom glittering with tears and gloriously radiant with stormy lights of wild passion and wilder hopes my faith lived valiantly till the next spring it was hebe who was faithless the cherry tree was dead for its dryad had gone fled said evil tongues fled away to the town but as yet in the time to which my thoughts return our sweet secret mornings were known only to ourselves it was my custom then to rise early to read latin authors thanks to hebe still unread i used to light my fire and make tea for myself till one rapturous morning i discovered that hebe was fond of rising early too and that she would like to light my fire and make my tea after a time she began to sweeten it for me and then she would sit on my knee and we would translate catullus together into english kisses for she was curiously interested in the learned tongue how lovely she used to look with the morning sun turning her hair to golden mist and dancing in the blue deeps of her eyes and once when by chance she had forgotten to fasten her gown i caught glimpses of a bosom that was like two happy handfuls of wonderful white cherries she wore a marvellous little printed gown and here i may say that i have never to this day understood objections which were afterwards raised against my early attachment to print the only legitimate attachment to print stuff i was told was to print stuff in the form of blouse tennis or boating costume yet thought i i would rather smuggle one of those little print gowns into my berth than all the silks a sea faring friend of mine takes the trouble to smuggle from far cathay however every one to his taste for me no silken madam by your leave though wondrous wondrous she be can lure this heart upon my sleeve from little pink print hebe for i found beneath that pretty print such a heart as seldom beats beneath your satin warm and wild as a bird's i used to put my ear to it sometimes to listen if it beat right ah reader it was like putting your ear to the gate of heaven and once i made a song for her which ran like this there grew twin apples high on a bough within an orchard fair the tree was all of gold i vow and the apples of silver were and whoso kisseth those apples high who kisseth once is a king who kisseth twice shall never die who kisseth thrice oh were it i may ask for anything hebe blushed and for answer whispered something too sweet to tell dear little head sunning over with curls were i to meet you now what would happen ah to meet you now were too painfully to measure the remnant of my youth chapter x again on foot the girls that never can be mine next morning i was afoot early bent on my quest in right good earnest for i had a remorseful feeling that i had not been sufficiently diligent the day before had spent too much time in dreaming and moralising in which opinion i am afraid the reader will agree so i was up and out of the town while as yet most of the inhabitants were in the throes of getting up somewhere too she the golden one the white woman was drowsily tossing the night clothes from her limbs and rubbing her sleepy eyes william morris's lovely song came into my mind and midst them all perchance my love is waking and doth gently move and stretch her soft arms out to me forgetting thousand leagues of sea perhaps she was in the very town i was leaving behind perhaps we had slept within a few houses of each other who could tell looking back at the old town with its one steep street climbing the white face of the chalk hill i remembered what wonderful exotic women thomas hardy had found eating their hearts out behind the windows of dull country high streets through which hung waving no banners of romance outwardly as unpromising of adventure as the windows of the town i had left and then turning my steps across a wide common which ran with gorse and whortleberry bushes away on every side to distant hilly horizons swarthy with pines and dotted here and there with stone granges and white villages i thought of all the women within that circle any one of whom might prove the woman i sought from milkmaids crossing the meadows their strong shoulders straining with the weight of heavy pails to fine ladies dying of ennui in their country houses pretty farmers daughters surreptitiously reading novels and longing for london and life passionate young farmers wives already weary of their doltish lords bright eyed bar maids buried alive in country inns and wondering whatever possessed them to leave manchester for bar maids seem always to come from manchester all longing modestly said i to set eyes on a man like me a man of romance a man of feeling a man if you like to run away with my heart flooded over with tender pity for these poor sweet women though perhaps chiefly for my own sad lot in not encountering them and i conceived a great comprehensive love poem to be entitled the girls that never can be mine perhaps before the end of our tramp together i shall have a few verses of it to submit to the elegant taste of the reader but at present i have not advanced beyond the title chapter xi an old man of the hills and the schoolmaster's story while occupying myself with these no doubt wanton reflections on the unfair division of opportunities in human life i was leisurely crossing the common and presently i came up with a pedestrian who though i had little suspected it as i caught sight of him ahead was destined by a kind providence to make more entertaining talk for me in half an hour than most people provide in a lifetime he was an oldish man turned sixty one would say and belonging to judge from his dress and general appearance to what one might call the upper labouring class he wore a decent square felt hat a shabby respectable overcoat a workman's knitted waistcoat and workman's corduroys and he carried an umbrella his upper part might have belonged to a small well to do tradesman while his lower bore marks of recent bricklaying without its being remarkable he had what one calls a good face somewhat aquiline in character with a refined forehead and nose his cheeks were shaved and his whitening beard and moustache were worn somewhat after the fashion of charles dickens this gave a slight touch of severity to a face that was full of quiet strength passing the time of day to each other we were soon in conversation i asking him this and that question about the neighbouring country side of which i gathered he was an old inhabitant yes he said presently i was the first to put stick or stone on whortleberry common yonder fifteen years ago i built my own wood cottage there and now i'm rebuilding it of good surrey stone do you mean that you are building it yourself with your own hands no one to help you i asked not so much as to carry a pail of water he replied i'm my own contractor my own carpenter and my own bricklayer and i shall be sixty seven come michaelmas he added by no means irrelevantly there was pride in his voice pardonable pride i thought for who of us would not be proud to be able to build his own house from floor to chimney sixty seven a man can see and do a good deal in that time i said not flattering myself on the originality of the remark but desiring to set him talking in the country as elsewhere we must forego profundity if we wish to be understood yes sir he said i have been about a good deal in my time i have seen pretty well all of the world there is to see and sailed as far as ship could take me indeed you have been a sailor too twenty two thousand miles of sea he continued without directly answering my remark yes vancouver's about as far as any vessel need want to go and then i have caught seals off the coast of labrador and walked my way through the raspberry plains at the back of the white mountains vancouver labrador the white mountains the very names thus casually mentioned on a surrey heath seemed full of the sounding sea like talismans they whisked one away to strange lands across vast distances of space imagination refused to span strange to think that the shabby little man at my side had them all fast locked pictures upon pictures in his brain and as we were talking was back again in goodness knows what remote latitude i kept looking at him and saying twenty two thousand miles of sea sixty seven and builds his own cottage in addition to all this he had found time to be twenty one years a policeman and to beget and rear successfully twelve children he was now i gathered living partly on his pension and spoke of this daughter married this daughter in service here and that daughter in service there one son settled in london and another in the states with something of a patriarchal pride with the independent air too of a man who could honestly say to himself that with few advantages from fortune having had so to say to work his passage every foot and hour of it across those twenty two thousand miles and those sixty seven years he had made a thoroughly creditable job of his life as we walked along i caught glimpses in his vivid and ever varying talk of the qualities that had made his success possible they are always the same qualities a little pile of half hewn stones the remains of a ruined wall scattered by the roadside caught his eye i've seen the time when i wouldn't have left them stones lying out there he said and presently why god bless you i've made my own boots before to day give me the tops and i'll soon rig up a pair still and with all his success and his evident satisfaction with his lot the man was neither a prig nor a teetotaller he had probably seen too much of the world to be either yet he had he said been too busy all his life to spend much time in public houses as we drank a pint of ale together in the inn which stood at the end of the common no it's all well enough in its way but it swallows time he remarked you see my wife and i have our own pin at home and when i'm a bit tired i just draw a glass for myself and smoke a pipe and there's no time wasted coming and going and drinking first with this and then with the other a little way past the inn we came upon a notice board whereon the lord of the manor warned all wayfarers against trespassing on the common by making encampments lighting fires or cutting firewood thereon and to this fortunate circumstance i owe the most interesting story my companion had to tell we had mentioned the lord of the manor as we crossed the common and the notice board brought him once more to the old man's mind poor gentleman he said pointing to the board as though it was the lord of the manor himself standing there i shouldn't like to have had the trouble he's had on my shoulders indeed i said interrogatively well you see sir he continued instinctively lowering his voice to a confidential impressiveness he married an actress a noble lady too she was a fine dashing merry lady as ever you saw all went well for a time and then it suddenly got whispered about that she and the village schoolmaster were meeting each other at nights in the meadow bottom at the end of her own park it lies over that way i could take you to the very place the schoolmaster was a noble looking young man too a devil me care blade of a fellow with a turn for poetry they said and a merry man too and much in request for a song at the moonrakers of an evening many s the night i've heard the windows rattling with the good company gathered round him yes he was a noble looking man a noble looking man he repeated wistfully and with an evident sympathy for the lovers which i need hardly say won my heart but how i wonder did they come to know each other i interrupted anxious to learn all i could even if i had to ask stupid questions to learn it well of course no one can say how these things come about she was the lady of the manor and the patroness of his school and then as i say he was a very noble looking man and probably took her fancy and sir whenever some women set their hearts on a man there's no stopping them have him they will whatever happens they can't help it poor things it's just a freak of nature well and how was it found out i again jogged him one of sir william's keepers played the spy on them he spread it all over the place how he had seen them on moonlight nights sitting together in the dingle drinking champagne and laughing and talking as merry as you please and of course it came in time to sir william you see that green lane there he broke off pointing to a romantic path winding along the heath side it was along there he used to go of a night to meet her after every one was in bed and when it all came out there was a regular cartload of bottles found there the squire had them all broken up but the pieces are there to this day yes he again proceeded it hit sir william very hard he's never been the same man since i am afraid that my sympathies were less with sir william than better regulated sympathies would have been i confess that my imagination was more occupied with that picture of the two lovers making merry together in the moonlit dingle is it not indeed a fascinating little story with its piquant contrasts and its wild love at all costs and how many such stories are hidden about the country lying carelessly in rustic memories if one only knew where to find them at this point my companion left me and i well i confess that i retraced my steps to the common and rambled up that green lane along which the romantic schoolmaster used to steal in the moonlight to the warm arms of his love how eagerly he had trodden the very turf i was treading we never know at what moment we are treading sacred earth but for that old man i had passed along this path without a thrill had i not but an hour ago stood upon this very common vainly so it seemed invoking the spirits of passion and romance and the grim old common had never made a sign and now i stood in the very dingle where they had so often and so wildly met and it was all gone quite gone away for ever the hours that had seemed so real the kisses that had seemed like to last for ever the vows the tears all now as if they had never been gone on the four winds lost in the abysses of time and space and to think of all the thousands and thousands of lovers who had loved no less wildly and tenderly made sweet these lanes with their vows made green these meadows with their feet and they too all gone their bright eyes fallen to dust their sweet voices for ever put to silence to which i would add for the benefit of the profane that i sought in vain for those broken bottles chapter xii the truth about the gipsies i felt lonely after losing my companion and i met nobody to take his place in fact for a couple of hours i met nothing worth mentioning male or female with the exception of a gipsy caravan which i suppose was both but it was a poor show borrow would have blushed for it in fact it is my humble opinion that the gipsies have been overdone just as the alps have been over climbed i have no great desire to see switzerland for i am sure the alps must be greasy with being climbed besides the alps and the gipsies in common with waterfalls and ruined castles belong to the ready made operatic poetry of the world from which the last thrill has long since departed they are so to say public poetry the public property of the emotions and no longer touch the private heart or stir the private imagination our fathers felt so much about them that there is nothing left for us to feel they are as a rose whose fragrance has been exhausted by greedy and indiscriminate smelling i would rather find a little surrey common for myself and idle about it a summer day with the other geese and donkeys than climb the tallest alp most gipsies are merely tenth rate provincial companies travelling with and villainously travestying borrow's great pieces of lavengro and romany rye dirty ill looking scowling men dirty slovenly and wickedly ugly women children to match snarling filthy little curs with a ready beggar's whine on occasion a gipsy encampment to day is little more than a moving slum a scab of squalor on the fair face of the countryside but there was one little trifle of an incident that touched me as i passed this particular caravan evidently one of the vans had come to grief and several men of the party were making a great show of repairing it after i had run the gauntlet of the begging children and was just out of ear shot of the group i turned round to survey it from a distance it was encamped on a slight rise of the undulating road and from where i stood tents and vans and men were clearly silhouetted against the sky the road ran through and a little higher than the encampment which occupied both sides of it presently the figure of a young man separated itself from the rest stept up on to the smooth road and standing in the middle of it in an absorbed attitude began to make a movement with his hands as though winding string round a top that in fact was his occupation and for the next five minutes he kept thus winding the cord flinging the top to the ground and intently bending down to catch it on his hand none of the others not even the children taking the slightest notice of him he entirely alone there with his poor little pleasure there seemed to me pathos in his loneliness had some one spun the top with him it would have vanished and presently no doubt at the bidding of an oath i could not hear he hurriedly thrust the top into his pocket and once more joined the straining group of men the snatched pleasure must be put by at the call of reality the world and its work must rush in upon his dream i have often thought about the top and its spinner as i have noted the absorbed faces of other people's pleasures in the streets two lovers passing along the crowded strand with eyes only for each other a student deep in his book in the corner of an omnibus a young mother glowing over the child in her arms the wild eyed musician dreamily treading on everybody's toes and begging nobody's pardon the pretty little gaiety girl hurrying to rehearsal with no thought but of her own sweet self and whether there will be a letter from harry at the stage door yes if we are alone in our griefs we are no less alone in our pleasures we spin our tops as in an enchanted circle and no one sees or heeds save ourselves as how should they with their own tops to spin happy indeed is he who has his top and cares still to spin it for to be tired of our tops is to be tired of life saith the preacher as the young gipsy's little holiday came to an end i turned with a sigh upon my way and here while still on the subject may i remark on the curious fact that probably borrow has lived and died without a single gipsy having heard of him just as the expertest anglers know nothing of izaak walton has the british soldier one wonders yet discovered rudyard kipling or is the wessex peasant aware of thomas hardy it is odd to think that the last people to read such authors are the very people they most concern for you might spend your life say in studying the london street boy and write never so movingly and humourously about him yet would he never know your name and though whitechapel makes novelists it does so without knowing it makes them to be read in mayfair just as it never wears the dainty hats and gowns its weary little milliners and seamstresses make through the day and night it is capital and labour over again for in literature also we reap in gladness what others have sown in tears and now after these admirable reflections i am about to make such art as i can of another man's tragedy as will appear in the next chapter chapter xiii a strange wedding my moralisings were cut short by my entering a village and it being about the hour of noon finding myself in the thick of a village wedding undoubtedly the nicest way to get married is on the sly and indeed it is at present becoming quite fashionable many young couples of my acquaintance who have had no other reason for concealing the fact beyond their own whim have thus slipped off without saying a word to anybody and returned full blown housekeepers with at home days of their own and everything else like real married people for as said an old lady to me one can never be sure of married people nowadays unless you have been at the wedding my friend george muncaster who does everything charmingly different from any one else hit upon one of the quaintest plans for his marriage it was simple and some may say prosaic enough his days being spent at a great office in the city he got leave of absence for a couple of hours met his wife went with her to the registrar's returned to his office worked the rest of the day as usual and then went to his new home to find his wife and dinner awaiting him all just as it was going to be every night for so many happy years prosaic you say not your idea of poetry perhaps but after a new and growing fashion in poetry truly poetic george muncaster's marriage is a type of the new poetry the poetry of essentials the old poetry as exemplified in the old fashioned marriage is a poetry of externals and certainly it has the advantage of picturesqueness there is perhaps more to be said for it than that indeed if i were ever to get married i am at a loss to know which way i should choose george muncaster's way or the old merry fashion with the rice and the old shoes and the orange blossom no doubt the old cheery publicity is a little embarrassing to the two most concerned and the old marriage customs the singing of the bride and bridegroom to their nuptial couch the frank jests the country horse play must have fretted the souls of many a lover before shelley who it will be remembered resented the choral celebrations of his scotch landlord and friends by appearing at his bedroom door with a brace of pistols how like shelley the scotch landlord meant well we may be sure and a very small pinch of humour or even mere ordinary humanity as distinct from humanitarianism would have taken in the situation of course shelley's mind was full of the sanctity of the moment and indignant that the hour for which the years did sigh should thus be broken in upon by vulgar revelry but while we may sympathise with his view and admit to the full the sacredness not to say the solemnity of the marriage ceremony yet it is to be hoped that it still retains a naturally mirthful side of which such public merriment is but the crude expression with all its sweet and mystical significance surely the prevailing feeling in the hearts of bride and bridegroom is or should be that of happiness happiness bubbling and dancing all sunny ripples from heart to heart surely they can spare a little of it just one day's sight of it to a less happy world a world long since married and done for and with little happiness in it save the spectacle of other people's happiness it is good for us to see happy people good for the symbols of happiness to be carried high amidst us on occasion for if they serve no other purpose they inspire in us the hope that we too may some day be happy or remind our discontented hearts that we have been if it were only for the sake of those quaint old women for whom life would be entirely robbed of interest were it not for other people's weddings and funerals one feels the public ceremony of marriage a sort of public duty the happiness tax so to say due to the somewhat impoverished revenues of public happiness other forms of happiness are taxed why not marriage in a village particularly two people who robbed the community of its perquisites in this respect would be looked upon as enemies of the people and their joint life would begin under a social ban which it would cost much subsequent hospitality to remove the dramatic instinct to which the life of towns is necessarily unfavourable is kept alive in the country by the smallness of the stage and"
