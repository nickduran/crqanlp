"1" "you mean by the real question of the rights of woman the question of the nature of this special being organized otherwise than man and how this being and man ought to view the wife chapter v yes for ten years i lived the most revolting existence while dreaming of the noblest love and even in the name of that love yes i want to tell you how i killed my wife and for that i must tell you how i debauched myself i killed her before i knew her i killed the wife when i first tasted sensual joys without love and then it was that i killed my wife yes sir it is only after having suffered after having tortured myself that i have come to understand the root of things that i have come to understand my crimes thus you will see where and how began the drama that has led me to misfortune it is necessary to go back to my sixteenth year when i was still at school and my elder brother a first year student i had not yet known women but like all the unfortunate children of our society i was already no longer innocent i was tortured as you were i am sure and as are tortured ninety nine one hundredths of our boys i lived in a frightful dread i prayed to god and i prostrated myself i was already perverted in imagination but the last steps remained to be taken i could still escape when a friend of my brother a very gay student one of those who are called good fellows that is the greatest of scamps and who had taught us to drink and play cards took advantage of a night of intoxication to drag us there we started my brother as innocent as i fell that night and i a mere lad of sixteen polluted myself and helped to pollute a sister woman without understanding what i did never had i heard from my elders that what i thus did was bad it is true that there are the ten commandments of the bible but the commandments are made only to be recited before the priests at examinations and even then are not as exacting as the commandments in regard to the use of ut in conditional propositions thus from my elders whose opinion i esteemed i had never heard that this was reprehensible on the contrary i had heard people whom i respected say that it was good i had heard that my struggles and my sufferings would be appeased after this act i had heard it and read it i had heard from my elders that it was excellent for the health and my friends have always seemed to believe that it contained i know not what merit and valor so nothing is seen in it but what is praiseworthy as for the danger of disease it is a foreseen danger does not the government guard against it and even science corrupts us how so science i asked why the doctors the pontiffs of science who pervert young people by laying down such rules of hygiene who pervert women by devising and teaching them ways by which not to have children yes if only a hundredth of the efforts spent in curing diseases were spent in curing debauchery disease would long ago have ceased to exist whereas now all efforts are employed not in extirpating debauchery but in favoring it by assuring the harmlessness of the consequences besides it is not a question of that it is a question of this frightful thing that has happened to me as it happens to nine tenths if not more not only of the men of our society but of all societies even peasants this frightful thing that i had fallen and not because i was subjected to the natural seduction of a certain woman no no woman seduced me i fell because the surroundings in which i found myself saw in this degrading thing only a legitimate function useful to the health because others saw in it simply a natural amusement not only excusable but even innocent in a young man i did not understand that it was a fall and i began to give myself to those pleasures partly from desire and partly from necessity which i was led to believe were characteristic of my age just as i had begun to drink and smoke and yet there was in this first fall something peculiar and touching i remember that straightway i was filled with such a profound sadness that i had a desire to weep to weep over the loss forever of my relations with woman yes my relations with woman were lost forever pure relations with women from that time forward i could no longer have i had become what is called a voluptuary and to be a voluptuary is a physical condition like the condition of a victim of the morphine habit of a drunkard and of a smoker just as the victim of the morphine habit the drunkard the smoker is no longer a normal man so the man who has known several women for his pleasure is no longer normal he is abnormal forever he is a voluptuary just as the drunkard and the victim of the morphine habit may be recognized by their face and manner so we may recognize a voluptuary he may repress himself and struggle but nevermore will he enjoy simple pure and fraternal relations toward woman by his way of glancing at a young woman one may at once recognize a voluptuary and i became a voluptuary and i have remained one chapter vi yes so it is and that went farther and farther with all sorts of variations my god when i remember all my cowardly acts and bad deeds i am frightened and i remember that me who during that period was still the butt of his comrades ridicule on account of his innocence and when i hear people talk of the gilded youth of the officers of the parisians and all these gentlemen and myself living wild lives at the age of thirty and who have on our consciences hundreds of crimes toward women terrible and varied when we enter a parlor or a ball room washed shaven and perfumed with very white linen in dress coats or in uniform as emblems of purity oh the disgust there will surely come a time an epoch when all these lives and all this cowardice will be unveiled so nevertheless i lived until the age of thirty without abandoning for a minute my intention of marrying and building an elevated conjugal life and with this in view i watched all young girls who might suit me i was buried in rottenness and at the same time i looked for virgins whose purity was worthy of me many of them were rejected they did not seem to me pure enough finally i found one that i considered on a level with myself she was one of two daughters of a landed proprietor of penza formerly very rich and since ruined to tell the truth without false modesty they pursued me and finally captured me the mother the father was away laid all sorts of traps and one of these a trip in a boat decided my future i made up my mind at the end of the aforesaid trip one night by moonlight on our way home while i was sitting beside her i admired her slender body whose charming shape was moulded by a jersey and her curling hair and i suddenly concluded that this was she it seemed to me on that beautiful evening that she understood all that i thought and felt and i thought and felt the most elevating things really it was only the jersey that was so becoming to her and her curly hair and also the fact that i had spent the day beside her and that i desired a more intimate relation i returned home enthusiastic and i persuaded myself that she realized the highest perfection and that for that reason she was worthy to be my wife and the next day i made to her a proposal of marriage no say what you will we live in such an abyss of falsehood that unless some event strikes us a blow on the head as in my case we cannot awaken what confusion out of the thousands of men who marry not only among us but also among the people scarcely will you find a single one who has not previously married at least ten times it is true that there now exist at least so i have heard pure young people who feel and know that this is not a joke but a serious matter may god come to their aid but in my time there was not to be found one such in a thousand and all know it and pretend not to know it in all the novels are described down to the smallest details the feelings of the characters the lakes and brambles around which they walk but when it comes to describing their great love not a word is breathed of what he the interesting character has previously done not a word about his frequenting of disreputable houses or his association with nursery maids cooks and the wives of others and if anything is said of these things such improper novels are not allowed in the hands of young girls all men have the air of believing in presence of maidens that these corrupt pleasures in which everybody takes part do not exist or exist only to a very small extent they pretend it so carefully that they succeed in convincing themselves of it as for the poor young girls they believe it quite seriously just as my poor wife believed it i remember that being already engaged i showed her my memoirs from which she could learn more or less of my past and especially my last liaison which she might perhaps have discovered through the gossip of some third party it was for this last reason for that matter that i felt the necessity of communicating these memoirs to her i can still see her fright her despair her bewilderment when she had learned and understood it she was on the point of breaking the engagement what a lucky thing it would have been for both of us posdnicheff was silent for a moment and then resumed after all no it is better that things happened as they did better he cried it was a good thing for me besides it makes no difference i was saying that in these cases it is the poor young girls who are deceived as for the mothers the mothers especially informed by their husbands they know all and while pretending to believe in the purity of the young man they act as if they did not believe in it they know what bait must be held out to people for themselves and their daughters we men sin through ignorance and a determination not to learn as for the women they know very well that the noblest and most poetic love as we call it depends not on moral qualities but on the physical intimacy and also on the manner of doing the hair and the color and shape ask an experienced coquette who has undertaken to seduce a man which she would prefer to be convicted in presence of the man whom she is engaged in conquering of falsehood perversity cruelty or to appear before him in an ill fitting dress or a dress of an unbecoming color she will prefer the first alternative she knows very well that we simply lie when we talk of our elevated sentiments that we seek only the possession of her body and that because of that we will forgive her every sort of baseness but will not forgive her a costume of an ugly shade without taste or fit and these things she knows by reason where as the maiden knows them only by instinct like the animal hence these abominable jerseys these artificial humps on the back these bare shoulders arms and throats women especially those who have passed through the school of marriage know very well that conversations upon elevated subjects are only conversations and that man seeks and desires the body and all that ornaments the body consequently they act accordingly if we reject conventional explanations and view the life of our upper and lower classes as it is with all its shamelessness it is only a vast perversity you do not share this opinion permit me i am going to prove it to you said he interrupting me you say that the women of our society live for a different interest from that which actuates fallen women and i say no and i am going to prove it to you if beings differ from one another according to the purpose of their life according to their inner life this will necessarily be reflected also in their outer life and their exterior will be very different well then compare the wretched the despised with the women of the highest society the same dresses the same fashions the same perfumeries the same passion for jewelry for brilliant and very expensive articles the same amusements dances music and songs the former attract by all possible means so do the latter no difference none whatever yes and i too was captivated by jerseys bustles and curly hair chapter vii and it was very easy to capture me since i was brought up under artificial conditions like cucumbers in a hothouse our too abundant nourishment together with complete physical idleness is nothing but systematic excitement of the imagination the men of our society are fed and kept like reproductive stallions it is sufficient to close the valve that is for a young man to live a quiet life for some time to produce as an immediate result a restlessness which becoming exaggerated by reflection through the prism of our unnatural life provokes the illusion of love all our idyls and marriage all are the result for the most part of our eating does that astonish you for my part i am astonished that we do not see it not far from my estate this spring some moujiks were working on a railway embankment you know what a peasant's food is bread kvass onions with this frugal nourishment he lives he is alert he makes light work in the fields but on the railway this bill of fare becomes cacha and a pound of meat only he restores this meat by sixteen hours of labor pushing loads weighing twelve hundred pounds kvass a sort of cider and we who eat two pounds of meat and game we who absorb all sorts of heating drinks and food how do we expend it in sensual excesses if the valve is open all goes well but close it as i had closed it temporarily before my marriage and immediately there will result an excitement which deformed by novels verses music by our idle and luxurious life will give a love of the finest water i too fell in love as everybody does and there were transports emotions poesy but really all this passion was prepared by mamma and the dressmakers if there had been no trips in boats no well fitted garments etc if my wife had worn some shapeless blouse and i had seen her thus at her home i should not have been seduced chapter viii and note also this falsehood of which all are guilty the way in which marriages are made what could there be more natural the young girl is marriageable she should marry what simpler provided the young person is not a monster and men can be found with a desire to marry well no here begins a new hypocrisy formerly when the maiden arrived at a favorable age her marriage was arranged by her parents that was done that is done still throughout humanity among the chinese the hindoos the mussulmans and among our common people also things are so managed in at least ninety nine per cent of the families of the entire human race only we riotous livers have imagined that this way was bad and have invented another and this other what is it it is this the young girls are seated and the gentlemen walk up and down before them as in a bazaar and make their choice the maidens wait and think but do not dare to say take me young man me and not her look at these shoulders and the rest we males walk up and down and estimate the merchandise and then we discourse upon the rights of woman upon the liberty that she acquires i know not how in the theatrical halls but what is to be done said i to him shall the woman make the advances i do not know but if it is a question of equality let the equality be complete though it has been found that to contract marriages through the agency of match makers is humiliating it is nevertheless a thousand times preferable to our system there the rights and the chances are equal here the woman is a slave exhibited in the market but as she cannot bend to her condition or make advances herself there begins that other and more abominable lie which is sometimes called going into society sometimes amusing one's self and which is really nothing but the hunt for a husband but say to a mother or to her daughter that they are engaged only in a hunt for a husband god what an offence yet they can do nothing else and have nothing else to do and the terrible feature of it all is to see sometimes very young poor and innocent maidens haunted solely by such ideas if only i repeat it were done frankly but it is always accompanied with lies and babble of this sort ah the descent of species how interesting it is oh lily is much interested in painting shall you go to the exposition how charming it is and the troika and the plays and the symphony ah how adorable my lise is passionately fond of music and you why do you not share these convictions and through all this verbiage all have but one single idea take me take my lise no me only try chapter ix do you know suddenly continued posdnicheff that this power of women from which the world suffers arises solely from what i have just spoken of what do you mean by the power of women i said everybody on the contrary complains that women have not sufficient rights that they are in subjection that's it that's it exactly said he vivaciously that is just what i mean and that is the explanation of this extraordinary phenomenon that on the one hand woman is reduced to the lowest degree of humiliation and on the other hand she reigns over everything see the jews with their power of money they avenge their subjection just as the women do ah you wish us to be only merchants all right remaining merchants we will get possession of you say the jews ah you wish us to be only objects of sensuality all right by the aid of sensuality we will bend you beneath our yoke say the women the absence of the rights of woman does not consist in the fact that she has not the right to vote or the right to sit on the bench but in the fact that in her affectional relations she is not the equal of man she has not the right to abstain to choose instead of being chosen you say that that would be abnormal very well but then do not let man enjoy these rights while his companion is deprived of them and finds herself obliged to make use of the coquetry by which she governs so that the result is that man chooses formally whereas really it is woman who chooses as soon as she is in possession of her means she abuses them and acquires a terrible supremacy but where do you see this exceptional power where why everywhere in everything go see the stores in the large cities there are millions there millions it is impossible to estimate the enormous quantity of labor that is expended there in nine tenths of these stores is there anything whatever for the use of men all the luxury of life is demanded and sustained by woman count the factories the greater part of them are engaged in making feminine ornaments millions of men generations of slaves die toiling like convicts simply to satisfy the whims of our companions women like queens keep nine tenths of the human race as prisoners of war or as prisoners at hard labor and all this because they have been humiliated because they have been deprived of rights equal to those which men enjoy they take revenge for our sensuality they catch us in their nets yes the whole thing is there women have made of themselves such a weapon to act upon the senses that a young man and even an old man cannot remain tranquil in their presence watch a popular festival or our receptions or ball rooms woman well knows her influence there you will see it in her triumphant smiles as soon as a young man advances toward a woman directly he falls under the influence of this opium and loses his head long ago i felt ill at ease when i saw a woman too well adorned whether a woman of the people with her red neckerchief and her looped skirt or a woman of our own society in her ball room dress but now it simply terrifies me i see in it a danger to men something contrary to the laws and i feel a desire to call a policeman to appeal for defence from some quarter to demand that this dangerous object be removed and this is not a joke by any means i am convinced i am sure that the time will come and perhaps it is not far distant when the world will understand this and will be astonished that a society could exist in which actions as harmful as those which appeal to sensuality by adorning the body as our companions do were allowed as well set traps along our public streets or worse than that chapter x that then was the way in which i was captured i was in love as it is called not only did she appear to me a perfect being but i considered myself a white blackbird it is a commonplace fact that there is no one so low in the world that he cannot find some one viler than himself and consequently puff with pride and self contentment i was in that situation i did not marry for money interest was foreign to the affair unlike the marriages of most of my acquaintances who married either for money or for relations first i was rich she was poor second i was especially proud of the fact that while others married with an intention of continuing their polygamic life as bachelors it was my firm intention to live monogamically after my engagement and the wedding and my pride swelled immeasurably yes i was a wretch convinced that i was an angel the period of my engagement did not last long i cannot remember those days without shame what an abomination it is generally agreed that love is a moral sentiment a community of thought rather than of sense if that is the case this community of thought ought to find expression in words and conversation nothing of the sort it was extremely difficult for us to talk with each other what a toil of sisyphus was our conversation scarcely had we thought of something to say and said it when we had to resume our silence and try to discover new subjects literally we did not know what to say to each other all that we could think of concerning the life that was before us and our home was said and then what if we had been animals we should have known that we had not to talk but here on the contrary it was necessary to talk and there were no resources for that which occupied our minds was not a thing to be expressed in words and then that silly custom of eating bon bons that brutal gluttony for sweetmeats those abominable preparations for the wedding those discussions with mamma upon the apartments upon the sleeping rooms upon the bedding upon the morning gowns upon the wrappers the linen the costumes understand that if people married according to the old fashion as this old man said just now then these eiderdown coverlets and this bedding would all be sacred details but with us out of ten married people there is scarcely to be found one who i do not say believes in sacraments whether he believes or not is a matter of indifference to us but believes in what he promises out of a hundred men there is scarcely one who has not married before and out of fifty scarcely one who has not made up his mind to deceive his wife the great majority look upon this journey to the church as a condition necessary to the possession of a certain woman think then of the supreme significance which material details must take on is it not a sort of sale in which a maiden is given over to a debauche the sale being surrounded with the most agreeable details chapter xi all marry in this way and i did like the rest if the young people who dream of the honeymoon only knew what a disillusion it is and always a disillusion i really do not know why all think it necessary to conceal it one day i was walking among the shows in paris when attracted by a sign i entered an establishment to see a bearded woman and a water dog the woman was a man in disguise and the dog was an ordinary dog covered with a sealskin and swimming in a bath it was not in the least interesting but the barnum accompanied me to the exit very courteously and in addressing the people who were coming in made an appeal to my testimony ask the gentleman if it is not worth seeing come in come in it only costs a franc and in my confusion i did not dare to answer that there was nothing curious to be seen and it was upon my false shame that the barnum must have counted it must be the same with the persons who have passed through the abominations of the honeymoon they do not dare to undeceive their neighbor and i did the same the felicities of the honeymoon do not exist on the contrary it is a period of uneasiness of shame of pity and above all of ennui of ferocious ennui it is something like the feeling of a youth when he is beginning to smoke he desires to vomit he drivels and swallows his drivel pretending to enjoy this little amusement the vice of marriage what vice i said but you are talking of one of the most natural things natural said he natural no i consider on the contrary that it is against nature and it is i a perverted man who have reached this conviction what would it be then if i had not known corruption to a young girl to every unperverted young girl it is an act extremely unnatural just as it is to children my sister married when very young a man twice her own age and who was utterly corrupt i remember how astonished we were the night of her wedding when pale and covered with tears she fled from her husband her whole body trembling saying that for nothing in the world would she tell what he wanted of her you say natural it is natural to eat that is a pleasant agreeable function which no one is ashamed to perform from the time of his birth no it is not natural a pure young girl wants one thing children children yes not a lover but said i with astonishment how would the human race continue but what is the use of its continuing he rejoined vehemently what what is the use but then we should not exist and why is it necessary that we should exist why to live to be sure and why live the schopenhauers the hartmanns and all the buddhists say that the greatest happiness is nirvana non life and they are right in this sense that human happiness is coincident with the annihilation of self only they do not express themselves well they say that humanity should annihilate itself to avoid its sufferings that its object should be to destroy itself now the object of humanity cannot be to avoid sufferings by annihilation since suffering is the result of activity the object of activity cannot consist in suppressing its consequences the object of man as of humanity is happiness and to attain it humanity has a law which it must carry out this law consists in the union of beings this union is thwarted by the passions and that is why if the passions disappear the union will be accomplished humanity then will"
