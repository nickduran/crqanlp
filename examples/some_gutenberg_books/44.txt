often but she did it thoroughly only a somewhat stern system of discipline could have kept any degree of order and quiet in that overcrowded house mrs kronborg's children were all trained to dress themselves at the earliest possible age to make their own beds the boys as well as the girls to take care of their clothes to eat what was given them and to keep out of the way mrs kronborg would have made a good chess player she had a head for moves and positions anna the elder daughter was her mother's lieutenant all the children knew that they must obey anna who was an obstinate contender for proprieties and not always fair minded to see the young kronborgs headed for sunday school was like watching a military drill mrs kronborg let her children's minds alone she did not pry into their thoughts or nag them she respected them as individuals and outside of the house they had a great deal of liberty but their communal life was definitely ordered in the winter the children breakfasted in the kitchen gus and charley and anna first while the younger children were dressing gus was nineteen and was a clerk in a dry goods store charley eighteen months younger worked in a feed store they left the house by the kitchen door at seven o'clock and then anna helped her aunt tillie get the breakfast for the younger ones without the help of this sister in law tillie kronborg mrs kronborg's life would have been a hard one mrs kronborg often reminded anna that no hired help would ever have taken the same interest mr kronborg came of a poorer stock than his wife from a lowly ignorant family that had lived in a poor part of sweden his great grandfather had gone to norway to work as a farm laborer and had married a norwegian girl this strain of norwegian blood came out somewhere in each generation of the kronborgs the intemperance of one of peter kronborg's uncles and the religious mania of another had been alike charged to the norwegian grandmother both peter kronborg and his sister tillie were more like the norwegian root of the family than like the swedish and this same norwegian strain was strong in thea though in her it took a very different character tillie was a queer addle pated thing as flighty as a girl at thirty five and overweeningly fond of gay clothes which taste as mrs kronborg philosophically said did nobody any harm tillie was always cheerful and her tongue was still for scarcely a minute during the day she had been cruelly overworked on her father's minnesota farm when she was a young girl and she had never been so happy as she was now had never before as she said had such social advantages she thought her brother the most important man in moonstone she never missed a church service and much to the embarrassment of the children she always spoke a piece at the sunday school concerts she had a complete set of standard recitations which she conned on sundays this morning when thea and her two younger brothers sat down to breakfast tillie was remonstrating with gunner because he had not learned a recitation assigned to him for george washington day at school the unmemorized text lay heavily on gunner's conscience as he attacked his buckwheat cakes and sausage he knew that tillie was in the right and that when the day came he would be ashamed of himself i don't care he muttered stirring his coffee they oughtn't to make boys speak it's all right for girls they like to show off no showing off about it boys ought to like to speak up for their country and what was the use of your father buying you a new suit if you're not going to take part in anything that was for sunday school i'd rather wear my old one anyhow why didn't they give the piece to thea gunner grumbled tillie was turning buckwheat cakes at the griddle thea can play and sing she don't need to speak but you've got to know how to do something gunner that you have what are you going to do when you git big and want to git into society if you can't do nothing everybody'll say can you sing can you play can you speak then git right out of society an that's what they'll say to you mr gunner gunner and alex grinned at anna who was preparing her mother's breakfast they never made fun of tillie but they understood well enough that there were subjects upon which her ideas were rather foolish when tillie struck the shallows thea was usually prompt in turning the conversation will you and axel let me have your sled at recess she asked all the time asked gunner dubiously i'll work your examples for you to night if you do oh all right there'll be a lot of em i don't mind i can work em fast how about yours axel axel was a fat little boy of seven with pretty lazy blue eyes i don't care he murmured buttering his last buckwheat cake without ambition too much trouble to copy em down jenny smiley'll let me have hers the boys were to pull thea to school on their sled as the snow was deep the three set off together anna was now in the high school and she no longer went with the family party but walked to school with some of the older girls who were her friends and wore a hat not a hood like thea iv and it was summer beautiful summer those were the closing words of thea's favorite fairy tale and she thought of them as she ran out into the world one saturday morning in may her music book under her arm she was going to the kohlers to take her lesson but she was in no hurry it was in the summer that one really lived then all the little overcrowded houses were opened wide and the wind blew through them with sweet earthy smells of garden planting the town looked as if it had just been washed people were out painting their fences the cottonwood trees were a flicker with sticky yellow little leaves and the feathery tamarisks were in pink bud with the warm weather came freedom for everybody people were dug up as it were the very old people whom one had not seen all winter came out and sunned themselves in the yard the double windows were taken off the houses the tormenting flannels in which children had been encased all winter were put away in boxes and the youngsters felt a pleasure in the cool cotton things next their skin thea had to walk more than a mile to reach the kohlers house a very pleasant mile out of town toward the glittering sand hills yellow this morning with lines of deep violet where the clefts and valleys were she followed the sidewalk to the depot at the south end of the town then took the road east to the little group of adobe houses where the mexicans lived then dropped into a deep ravine a dry sand creek across which the railroad track ran on a trestle beyond that gulch on a little rise of ground that faced the open sandy plain was the kohlers house where professor wunsch lived fritz kohler was the town tailor one of the first settlers he had moved there built a little house and made a garden when moonstone was first marked down on the map he had three sons but they now worked on the railroad and were stationed in distant cities one of them had gone to work for the santa fe and lived in new mexico mrs kohler seldom crossed the ravine and went into the town except at christmas time when she had to buy presents and christmas cards to send to her old friends in freeport illinois as she did not go to church she did not possess such a thing as a hat year after year she wore the same red hood in winter and a black sunbonnet in summer she made her own dresses the skirts came barely to her shoe tops and were gathered as full as they could possibly be to the waistband she preferred men's shoes and usually wore the cast offs of one of her sons she had never learned much english and her plants and shrubs were her companions she lived for her men and her garden beside that sand gulch she had tried to reproduce a bit of her own village in the rhine valley she hid herself behind the growth she had fostered lived under the shade of what she had planted and watered and pruned in the blaze of the open plain she was stupid and blind like an owl shade shade that was what she was always planning and making behind the high tamarisk hedge her garden was a jungle of verdure in summer above the cherry trees and peach trees and golden plums stood the windmill with its tank on stilts which kept all this verdure alive outside the sage brush grew up to the very edge of the garden and the sand was always drifting up to the tamarisks every one in moonstone was astonished when the kohlers took the wandering music teacher to live with them in seventeen years old fritz had never had a crony except the harness maker and spanish johnny this wunsch came from god knew where followed spanish johnny into town when that wanderer came back from one of his tramps wunsch played in the dance orchestra tuned pianos and gave lessons when mrs kohler rescued him he was sleeping in a dirty unfurnished room over one of the saloons and he had only two shirts in the world once he was under her roof the old woman went at him as she did at her garden she sewed and washed and mended for him and made him so clean and respectable that he was able to get a large class of pupils and to rent a piano as soon as he had money ahead he sent to the narrow gauge lodging house in denver for a trunkful of music which had been held there for unpaid board with tears in his eyes the old man he was not over fifty but sadly battered told mrs kohler that he asked nothing better of god than to end his days with her and to be buried in the garden under her linden trees they were not american basswood but the european linden which has honey colored blooms in summer with a fragrance that surpasses all trees and flowers and drives young people wild with joy thea was reflecting as she walked along that had it not been for professor wunsch she might have lived on for years in moonstone without ever knowing the kohlers without ever seeing their garden or the inside of their house besides the cuckoo clock which was wonderful enough and which mrs kohler said she kept for company when she was lonesome the kohlers had in their house the most wonderful thing thea had ever seen but of that later professor wunsch went to the houses of his other pupils to give them their lessons but one morning he told mrs kronborg that thea had talent and that if she came to him he could teach her in his slippers and that would be better mrs kronborg was a strange woman that word talent which no one else in moonstone not even dr archie would have understood she comprehended perfectly to any other woman there it would have meant that a child must have her hair curled every day and must play in public mrs kronborg knew it meant that thea must practice four hours a day a child with talent must be kept at the piano just as a child with measles must be kept under the blankets mrs kronborg and her three sisters had all studied piano and all sang well but none of them had talent their father had played the oboe in an orchestra in sweden before he came to america to better his fortunes he had even known jenny lind a child with talent had to be kept at the piano so twice a week in summer and once a week in winter thea went over the gulch to the kohlers though the ladies aid society thought it was not proper for their preacher's daughter to go where there was so much drinking not that the kohler sons ever so much as looked at a glass of beer they were ashamed of their old folks and got out into the world as fast as possible had their clothes made by a denver tailor and their necks shaved up under their hair and forgot the past old fritz and wunsch however indulged in a friendly bottle pretty often the two men were like comrades perhaps the bond between them was the glass wherein lost hopes are found perhaps it was common memories of another country perhaps it was the grapevine in the garden knotty fibrous shrub full of homesickness and sentiment which the germans have carried around the world with them as thea approached the house she peeped between the pink sprays of the tamarisk hedge and saw the professor and mrs kohler in the garden spading and raking the garden looked like a relief map now and gave no indication of what it would be in august such a jungle pole beans and potatoes and corn and leeks and kale and red cabbage there would even be vegetables for which there is no american name mrs kohler was always getting by mail packages of seeds from freeport and from the old country then the flowers there were big sunflowers for the canary bird tiger lilies and phlox and zinnias and lady's slippers and portulaca and hollyhocks giant hollyhocks beside the fruit trees there was a great umbrella shaped catalpa and a balm of gilead two lindens and even a ginka a rigid pointed tree with leaves shaped like butterflies which shivered but never bent to the wind this morning thea saw to her delight that the two oleander trees one white and one red had been brought up from their winter quarters in the cellar there is hardly a german family in the most arid parts of utah new mexico arizona but has its oleander trees however loutish the american born sons of the family may be there was never one who refused to give his muscle to the back breaking task of getting those tubbed trees down into the cellar in the fall and up into the sunlight in the spring they may strive to avert the day but they grapple with the tub at last when thea entered the gate her professor leaned his spade against the white post that supported the turreted dove house and wiped his face with his shirt sleeve someway he never managed to have a handkerchief about him wunsch was short and stocky with something rough and bear like about his shoulders his face was a dark bricky red deeply creased rather than wrinkled and the skin was like loose leather over his neck band he wore a brass collar button but no collar his hair was cropped close iron gray bristles on a bullet like head his eyes were always suffused and bloodshot he had a coarse scornful mouth and irregular yellow teeth much worn at the edges his hands were square and red seldom clean but always alive impatient even sympathetic morgen he greeted his pupil in a businesslike way put on a black alpaca coat and conducted her at once to the piano in mrs kohler's sitting room he twirled the stool to the proper height pointed to it and sat down in a wooden chair beside thea the scale of b flat major he directed and then fell into an attitude of deep attention without a word his pupil set to work to mrs kohler in the garden came the cheerful sound of effort of vigorous striving unconsciously she wielded her rake more lightly occasionally she heard the teacher's voice scale of e minor weiter weiter immer i hear the thumb like a lame foot weiter weiter once schon the chords quick the pupil did not open her mouth until they began the second movement of the clementi sonata when she remonstrated in low tones about the way he had marked the fingering of a passage it makes no matter what you think replied her teacher coldly there is only one right way the thumb there ein zwei drei vier etc then for an hour there was no further interruption at the end of the lesson thea turned on her stool and leaned her arm on the keyboard they usually had a little talk after the lesson herr wunsch grinned how soon is it you are free from school then we make ahead faster eh first week in june then will you give me the invitation to the dance he shrugged his shoulders it makes no matter if you want him you play him out of lesson hours all right thea fumbled in her pocket and brought out a crumpled slip of paper what does this mean please i guess it's latin wunsch blinked at the line penciled on the paper wherefrom you get this he asked gruffly out of a book dr archie gave me to read it's all english but that did you ever see it before she asked watching his face yes a long time ago he muttered scowling ovidius he took a stub of lead pencil from his vest pocket steadied his hand by a visible effort and under the words lente currite lente currite noctis equi he wrote in a clear elegant gothic hand go slowly go slowly ye steeds of the night he put the pencil back in his pocket and continued to stare at the latin it recalled the poem which he had read as a student and thought very fine there were treasures of memory which no lodging house keeper could attach one carried things about in one's head long after one's linen could be smuggled out in a tuning bag he handed the paper back to thea there is the english quite elegant he said rising mrs kohler stuck her head in at the door and thea slid off the stool come in mrs kohler she called and show me the piece picture the old woman laughed pulled off her big gardening gloves and pushed thea to the lounge before the object of her delight the piece picture which hung on the wall and nearly covered one whole end of the room was the handiwork of fritz kohler he had learned his trade under an old fashioned tailor in magdeburg who required from each of his apprentices a thesis that is before they left his shop each apprentice had to copy in cloth some well known german painting stitching bits of colored stuff together on a linen background a kind of mosaic the pupil was allowed to select his subject and fritz kohler had chosen a popular painting of napoleon's retreat from moscow the gloomy emperor and his staff were represented as crossing a stone bridge and behind them was the blazing city the walls and fortresses done in gray cloth with orange tongues of flame darting about the domes and minarets napoleon rode his white horse murat in oriental dress a bay charger thea was never tired of examining this work of hearing how long it had taken fritz to make it how much it had been admired and what narrow escapes it had had from moths and fire silk mrs kohler explained would have been much easier to manage than woolen cloth in which it was often hard to get the right shades the reins of the horses the wheels of the spurs the brooding eyebrows of the emperor murat's fierce mustaches the great shakos of the guard were all worked out with the minutest fidelity thea's admiration for this picture had endeared her to mrs kohler it was now many years since she used to point out its wonders to her own little boys as mrs kohler did not go to church she never heard any singing except the songs that floated over from mexican town and thea often sang for her after the lesson was over this morning wunsch pointed to the piano on sunday when i go by the church i hear you sing something thea obediently sat down on the stool again and began come ye disconsolate wunsch listened thoughtfully his hands on his knees such a beautiful child's voice old mrs kohler's face relaxed in a smile of happiness she half closed her eyes a big fly was darting in and out of the window the sunlight made a golden pool on the rag carpet and bathed the faded cretonne pillows on the lounge under the piece picture earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal the song died away that is a good thing to remember wunsch shook himself you believe that looking quizzically at thea she became confused and pecked nervously at a black key with her middle finger i don't know i guess so she murmured her teacher rose abruptly remember for next time thirds you ought to get up earlier that night the air was so warm that fritz and herr wunsch had their after supper pipe in the grape arbor smoking in silence while the sound of fiddles and guitars came across the ravine from mexican town long after fritz and his old paulina had gone to bed wunsch sat motionless in the arbor looking up through the woolly vine leaves at the glittering machinery of heaven lente currite noctis equi that line awoke many memories he was thinking of youth of his own so long gone by and of his pupil's just beginning he would even have cherished hopes for her except that he had become superstitious he believed that whatever he hoped for was destined not to be that his affection brought ill fortune especially to the young that if he held anything in his thoughts he harmed it he had taught in music schools in st louis and kansas city where the shallowness and complacency of the young misses had maddened him he had encountered bad manners and bad faith had been the victim of sharpers of all kinds was dogged by bad luck he had played in orchestras that were never paid and wandering opera troupes which disbanded penniless and there was always the old enemy more relentless than the others it was long since he had wished anything or desired anything beyond the necessities of the body now that he was tempted to hope for another he felt alarmed and shook his head it was his pupil's power of application her rugged will that interested him he had lived for so long among people whose sole ambition was to get something for nothing that he had learned not to look for seriousness in anything now that he by chance encountered it it recalled standards ambitions a society long forgot what was it she reminded him of a yellow flower full of sunlight perhaps no a thin glass full of sweet smelling sparkling moselle wine he seemed to see such a glass before him in the arbor to watch the bubbles rising and breaking like the silent discharge of energy in the nerves and brain the rapid florescence in young blood wunsch felt ashamed and dragged his slippers along the path to the kitchen his eyes on the ground v the children in the primary grades were sometimes required to make relief maps of moonstone in sand had they used colored sands as the navajo medicine men do in their sand mosaics they could easily have indicated the social classifications of moonstone since these conformed to certain topographical boundaries and every child understood them perfectly the main business street ran of course through the center of the town to the west of this street lived all the people who were as tillie kronborg said in society sylvester street the third parallel with main street on the west was the longest in town and the best dwellings were built along it far out at the north end nearly a mile from the court house and its cottonwood grove was dr archie's house its big yard and garden surrounded by a white paling fence the methodist church was in the center of the town facing the court house square the kronborgs lived half a mile south of the church on the long street that stretched out like an arm to the depot settlement this was the first street west of main and was built up only on one side the preacher's house faced the backs of the brick and frame store buildings and a draw full of sunflowers and scraps of old iron the sidewalk which ran in front of the kronborgs house was the one continuous sidewalk to the depot and all the train men and roundhouse employees passed the front gate every time they came uptown thea and mrs kronborg had many friends among the railroad men who often paused to chat across the fence and of one of these we shall have more to say in the part of moonstone that lay east of main street toward the deep ravine which farther south wound by mexican town lived all the humbler citizens the people who voted but did not run for office the houses were little story and a half cottages with none of the fussy architectural efforts that marked those on sylvester street they nestled modestly behind their cottonwoods and virginia creeper their occupants had no social pretensions to keep up there were no half glass front doors with doorbells or formidable parlors behind closed shutters here the old women washed in the back yard and the men sat in the front doorway and smoked their pipes the people on sylvester street scarcely knew that this part of the town existed thea liked to take thor and her express wagon and explore these quiet shady streets where the people never tried to have lawns or to grow elms and pine trees but let the native timber have its way and spread in luxuriance she had many friends there old women who gave her a yellow rose or a spray of trumpet vine and appeased thor with a cooky or a doughnut they called thea that preacher's girl but the demonstrative was misplaced for when they spoke of mr kronborg they called him the methodist preacher dr archie was very proud of his yard and garden which he worked himself he was the only man in moonstone who was successful at growing rambler roses and his strawberries were famous one morning when thea was downtown on an errand the doctor stopped her took her hand and went over her with a quizzical eye as he nearly always did when they met you haven't been up to my place to get any strawberries yet thea they're at their best just now mrs archie doesn't know what to do with them all come up this afternoon just tell mrs archie i sent you bring a big basket and pick till you are tired when she got home thea told her mother that she didn't want to go because she didn't like mrs archie she is certainly one queer woman mrs kronborg assented but he's asked you so often i guess you'll have to go this time she won't bite you after dinner thea took a basket put thor in his baby buggy and set out for dr archie's house at the other end of town as soon as she came within sight of the house she slackened her pace she approached it very slowly stopping often to pick dandelions and sand peas for thor to crush up in his fist it was his wife's custom as soon as dr archie left the house in the morning to shut all the doors and windows to keep the dust out and to pull down the shades to keep the sun from fading the carpets she thought too that neighbors were less likely to drop in if the house was closed up she was one of those people who are stingy without motive or reason even when they can gain nothing by it she must have known that skimping the doctor in heat and food made him more extravagant than he would have been had she made him comfortable he never came home for lunch because she gave him such miserable scraps and shreds of food no matter how much milk he bought he could never get thick cream for his strawberries even when he watched his wife lift it from the milk in smooth ivory colored blankets she managed by some sleight of hand to dilute it before it got to the breakfast table the butcher's favorite joke was about the kind of meat he sold mrs archie she felt no interest in food herself and she hated to prepare it she liked nothing better than to have dr archie go to denver for a few days he often went chiefly because he was"
