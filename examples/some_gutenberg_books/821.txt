"1" "the two medical attendants exchanged a look across the bed and the physician stooping down whispered in the child's ear not having understood the purport of his whisper the little creature turned her perfectly colourless face and deep dark eyes towards him but without loosening her hold in the least the whisper was repeated mama said the child the little voice familiar and dearly loved awakened some show of consciousness even at that ebb for a moment the closed eye lids trembled and the nostril quivered and the faintest shadow of a smile was seen mama cried the child sobbing aloud oh dear mama oh dear mama the doctor gently brushed the scattered ringlets of the child aside from the face and mouth of the mother alas how calm they lay there how little breath there was to stir them thus clinging fast to that slight spar within her arms the mother drifted out upon the dark and unknown sea that rolls round all the world chapter 2 in which timely provision is made for an emergency that will sometimes arise in the best regulated families i shall never cease to congratulate myself said mrs chick on having said when i little thought what was in store for us really as if i was inspired by something that i forgave poor dear fanny everything whatever happens that must always be a comfort to me mrs chick made this impressive observation in the drawing room after having descended thither from the inspection of the mantua makers upstairs who were busy on the family mourning she delivered it for the behoof of mr chick who was a stout bald gentleman with a very large face and his hands continually in his pockets and who had a tendency in his nature to whistle and hum tunes which sensible of the indecorum of such sounds in a house of grief he was at some pains to repress at present don't you over exert yourself loo said mr chick or you'll be laid up with spasms i see right tol loor rul bless my soul i forgot we're here one day and gone the next mrs chick contented herself with a glance of reproof and then proceeded with the thread of her discourse i am sure she said i hope this heart rending occurrence will be a warning to all of us to accustom ourselves to rouse ourselves and to make efforts in time where they're required of us there's a moral in everything if we would only avail ourselves of it it will be our own faults if we lose sight of this one mr chick invaded the grave silence which ensued on this remark with the singularly inappropriate air of a cobbler there was and checking himself in some confusion observed that it was undoubtedly our own faults if we didn't improve such melancholy occasions as the present which might be better improved i should think mr c retorted his helpmate after a short pause than by the introduction either of the college hornpipe or the equally unmeaning and unfeeling remark of rump te iddity bow wow wow which mr chick had indeed indulged in under his breath and which mrs chick repeated in a tone of withering scorn merely habit my dear pleaded mr chick nonsense habit returned his wife if you're a rational being don't make such ridiculous excuses habit if i was to get a habit as you call it of walking on the ceiling like the flies i should hear enough of it i daresay it appeared so probable that such a habit might be attended with some degree of notoriety that mr chick didn't venture to dispute the position bow wow wow repeated mrs chick with an emphasis of blighting contempt on the last syllable more like a professional singer with the hydrophobia than a man in your station of life how's the baby loo asked mr chick to change the subject what baby do you mean answered mrs chick the poor bereaved little baby said mr chick i don't know of any other my dear you don't know of any other retorted mrs chick more shame for you i was going to say mr chick looked astonished i am sure the morning i have had with that dining room downstairs one mass of babies no one in their senses would believe one mass of babies repeated mr chick staring with an alarmed expression about him it would have occurred to most men said mrs chick that poor dear fanny being no more those words of mine will always be a balm and comfort to me here she dried her eyes it becomes necessary to provide a nurse oh ah said mr chick toor ru such is life i mean i hope you are suited my dear indeed i am not said mrs chick nor likely to be so far as i can see and in the meantime the poor child seems likely to be starved to death paul is so very particular naturally so of course having set his whole heart on this one boy and there are so many objections to everybody that offers that i don't see myself the least chance of an arrangement meanwhile of course the child is going to the devil said mr chick thoughtfully to be sure admonished however that he had committed himself by the indignation expressed in mrs chick's countenance at the idea of a dombey going there and thinking to atone for his misconduct by a bright suggestion he added couldn't something temporary be done with a teapot if he had meant to bring the subject prematurely to a close he could not have done it more effectually after looking at him for some moments in silent resignation mrs chick said she trusted he hadn't said it in aggravation because that would do very little honour to his heart she trusted he hadn't said it seriously because that would do very little honour to his head as in any case he couldn't however sanguine his disposition hope to offer a remark that would be a greater outrage on human nature in general we would beg to leave the discussion at that point mrs chick then walked majestically to the window and peeped through the blind attracted by the sound of wheels mr chick finding that his destiny was for the time against him said no more and walked off but it was not always thus with mr chick he was often in the ascendant himself and at those times punished louisa roundly in their matrimonial bickerings they were upon the whole a well matched fairly balanced give and take couple it would have been generally speaking very difficult to have betted on the winner often when mr chick seemed beaten he would suddenly make a start turn the tables clatter them about the ears of mrs chick and carry all before him being liable himself to similar unlooked for checks from mrs chick their little contests usually possessed a character of uncertainty that was very animating miss tox had arrived on the wheels just now alluded to and came running into the room in a breathless condition my dear louisa said miss tox is the vacancy still unsupplied you good soul yes said mrs chick then my dear louisa returned miss tox i hope and believe but in one moment my dear i'll introduce the party running downstairs again as fast as she had run up miss tox got the party out of the hackney coach and soon returned with it under convoy it then appeared that she had used the word not in its legal or business acceptation when it merely expresses an individual but as a noun of multitude or signifying many for miss tox escorted a plump rosy cheeked wholesome apple faced young woman with an infant in her arms a younger woman not so plump but apple faced also who led a plump and apple faced child in each hand another plump and also apple faced boy who walked by himself and finally a plump and apple faced man who carried in his arms another plump and apple faced boy whom he stood down on the floor and admonished in a husky whisper to kitch hold of his brother johnny my dear louisa said miss tox knowing your great anxiety and wishing to relieve it i posted off myself to the queen charlotte's royal married females which you had forgot and put the question was there anybody there that they thought would suit no they said there was not when they gave me that answer i do assure you my dear i was almost driven to despair on your account but it did so happen that one of the royal married females hearing the inquiry reminded the matron of another who had gone to her own home and who she said would in all likelihood be most satisfactory the moment i heard this and had it corroborated by the matron excellent references and unimpeachable character i got the address my dear and posted off again like the dear good tox you are said louisa not at all returned miss tox don't say so arriving at the house the cleanest place my dear you might eat your dinner off the floor i found the whole family sitting at table and feeling that no account of them could be half so comfortable to you and mr dombey as the sight of them all together i brought them all away this gentleman said miss tox pointing out the apple faced man is the father will you have the goodness to come a little forward sir the apple faced man having sheepishly complied with this request stood chuckling and grinning in a front row this is his wife of course said miss tox singling out the young woman with the baby how do you do polly i'm pretty well i thank you ma'am said polly by way of bringing her out dexterously miss tox had made the inquiry as in condescension to an old acquaintance whom she hadn't seen for a fortnight or so i'm glad to hear it said miss tox the other young woman is her unmarried sister who lives with them and would take care of her children her name's jemima how do you do jemima i'm pretty well i thank you ma'am returned jemima i'm very glad indeed to hear it said miss tox i hope you'll keep so five children youngest six weeks the fine little boy with the blister on his nose is the eldest the blister i believe said miss tox looking round upon the family is not constitutional but accidental the apple faced man was understood to growl flat iron i beg your pardon sir said miss tox did you flat iron he repeated oh yes said miss tox yes quite true i forgot the little creature in his mother's absence smelt a warm flat iron you're quite right sir you were going to have the goodness to inform me when we arrived at the door that you were by trade a stoker said the man a choker said miss tox quite aghast stoker said the man steam ingine oh h yes returned miss tox looking thoughtfully at him and seeming still to have but a very imperfect understanding of his meaning and how do you like it sir which mum said the man that replied miss tox your trade oh pretty well mum the ashes sometimes gets in here touching his chest and makes a man speak gruff as at the present time but it is ashes mum not crustiness miss tox seemed to be so little enlightened by this reply as to find a difficulty in pursuing the subject but mrs chick relieved her by entering into a close private examination of polly her children her marriage certificate testimonials and so forth polly coming out unscathed from this ordeal mrs chick withdrew with her report to her brother's room and as an emphatic comment on it and corroboration of it carried the two rosiest little toodles with her toodle being the family name of the apple faced family mr dombey had remained in his own apartment since the death of his wife absorbed in visions of the youth education and destination of his baby son something lay at the bottom of his cool heart colder and heavier than its ordinary load but it was more a sense of the child's loss than his own awakening within him an almost angry sorrow that the life and progress on which he built such hopes should be endangered in the outset by so mean a want that dombey and son should be tottering for a nurse was a sore humiliation and yet in his pride and jealousy he viewed with so much bitterness the thought of being dependent for the very first step towards the accomplishment of his soul's desire on a hired serving woman who would be to the child for the time all that even his alliance could have made his own wife that in every new rejection of a candidate he felt a secret pleasure the time had now come however when he could no longer be divided between these two sets of feelings the less so as there seemed to be no flaw in the title of polly toodle after his sister had set it forth with many commendations on the indefatigable friendship of miss tox these children look healthy said mr dombey but my god to think of their some day claiming a sort of relationship to paul but what relationship is there louisa began is there echoed mr dombey who had not intended his sister to participate in the thought he had unconsciously expressed is there did you say louisa can there be i mean why none said mr dombey sternly the whole world knows that i presume grief has not made me idiotic louisa take them away louisa let me see this woman and her husband mrs chick bore off the tender pair of toodles and presently returned with that tougher couple whose presence her brother had commanded my good woman said mr dombey turning round in his easy chair as one piece and not as a man with limbs and joints i understand you are poor and wish to earn money by nursing the little boy my son who has been so prematurely deprived of what can never be replaced i have no objection to your adding to the comforts of your family by that means so far as i can tell you seem to be a deserving object but i must impose one or two conditions on you before you enter my house in that capacity while you are here i must stipulate that you are always known as say as richards an ordinary name and convenient have you any objection to be known as richards you had better consult your husband well said mr dombey after a pretty long pause what does your husband say to your being called richards as the husband did nothing but chuckle and grin and continually draw his right hand across his mouth moistening the palm mrs toodle after nudging him twice or thrice in vain dropped a curtsey and replied that perhaps if she was to be called out of her name it would be considered in the wages oh of course said mr dombey i desire to make it a question of wages altogether now richards if you nurse my bereaved child i wish you to remember this always you will receive a liberal stipend in return for the discharge of certain duties in the performance of which i wish you to see as little of your family as possible when those duties cease to be required and rendered and the stipend ceases to be paid there is an end of all relations between us do you understand me mrs toodle seemed doubtful about it and as to toodle himself he had evidently no doubt whatever that he was all abroad you have children of your own said mr dombey it is not at all in this bargain that you need become attached to my child or that my child need become attached to you i don't expect or desire anything of the kind quite the reverse when you go away from here you will have concluded what is a mere matter of bargain and sale hiring and letting and will stay away the child will cease to remember you and you will cease if you please to remember the child mrs toodle with a little more colour in her cheeks than she had had before said she hoped she knew her place i hope you do richards said mr dombey i have no doubt you know it very well indeed it is so plain and obvious that it could hardly be otherwise louisa my dear arrange with richards about money and let her have it when and how she pleases mr what's your name a word with you if you please thus arrested on the threshold as he was following his wife out of the room toodle returned and confronted mr dombey alone he was a strong loose round shouldered shuffling shaggy fellow on whom his clothes sat negligently with a good deal of hair and whisker deepened in its natural tint perhaps by smoke and coal dust hard knotty hands and a square forehead as coarse in grain as the bark of an oak a thorough contrast in all respects to mr dombey who was one of those close shaved close cut moneyed gentlemen who are glossy and crisp like new bank notes and who seem to be artificially braced and tightened as by the stimulating action of golden showerbaths you have a son i believe said mr dombey four on em sir four hims and a her all alive why it's as much as you can afford to keep them said mr dombey i couldn't hardly afford but one thing in the world less sir what is that to lose em sir can you read asked mr dombey why not partick'ler sir write with chalk sir with anything i could make shift to chalk a little bit i think if i was put to it said toodle after some reflection and yet said mr dombey you are two or three and thirty i suppose thereabouts i suppose sir answered toodle after more reflection then why don't you learn asked mr dombey so i'm a going to sir one of my little boys is a going to learn me when he's old enough and been to school himself well said mr dombey after looking at him attentively and with no great favour as he stood gazing round the room principally round the ceiling and still drawing his hand across and across his mouth you heard what i said to your wife just now polly heerd it said toodle jerking his hat over his shoulder in the direction of the door with an air of perfect confidence in his better half it's all right but i ask you if you heard it you did i suppose and understood it pursued mr dombey i heerd it said toodle but i don't know as i understood it rightly sir account of being no scholar and the words being ask your pardon rayther high but polly heerd it it's all right as you appear to leave everything to her said mr dombey frustrated in his intention of impressing his views still more distinctly on the husband as the stronger character i suppose it is of no use my saying anything to you not a bit said toodle polly heerd it she's awake sir i won't detain you any longer then returned mr dombey disappointed where have you worked all your life mostly underground sir till i got married i come to the level then i'm a going on one of these here railroads when they comes into full play as he added in one of his hoarse whispers we means to bring up little biler to that line mr dombey inquired haughtily who little biler was the eldest on em sir said toodle with a smile it ain't a common name sermuchser that when he was took to church the gen'lm'n said it wam't a chris'en one and he couldn't give it but we always calls him biler just the same for we don't mean no harm not we do you mean to say man inquired mr dombey looking at him with marked displeasure that you have called a child after a boiler no no sir returned toodle with a tender consideration for his mistake i should hope not no sir arter a biler sir the steamingine was a'most as good as a godfather to him and so we called him biler don't you see as the last straw breaks the laden camel's back this piece of information crushed the sinking spirits of mr dombey he motioned his child's foster father to the door who departed by no means unwillingly and then turning the key paced up and down the room in solitary wretchedness it would be harsh and perhaps not altogether true to say of him that he felt these rubs and gratings against his pride more keenly than he had felt his wife's death but certainly they impressed that event upon him with new force and communicated to it added weight and bitterness it was a rude shock to his sense of property in his child that these people the mere dust of the earth as he thought them should be necessary to him and it was natural that in proportion as he felt disturbed by it he should deplore the occurrence which had made them so for all his starched impenetrable dignity and composure he wiped blinding tears from his eyes as he paced up and down his room and often said with an emotion of which he would not for the world have had a witness poor little fellow it may have been characteristic of mr dombey's pride that he pitied himself through the child not poor me not poor widower confiding by constraint in the wife of an ignorant hind who has been working mostly underground all his life and yet at whose door death had never knocked and at whose poor table four sons daily sit but poor little fellow those words being on his lips it occurred to him and it is an instance of the strong attraction with which his hopes and fears and all his thoughts were tending to one centre that a great temptation was being placed in this woman's way her infant was a boy too now would it be possible for her to change them though he was soon satisfied that he had dismissed the idea as romantic and unlikely though possible there was no denying he could not help pursuing it so far as to entertain within himself a picture of what his condition would be if he should discover such an imposture when he was grown old whether a man so situated would be able to pluck away the result of so many years of usage confidence and belief from the impostor and endow a stranger with it but it was idle speculating thus it couldn't happen in a moment afterwards he determined that it could but that such women were constantly observed and had no opportunity given them for the accomplishment of such a design even when they were so wicked as to entertain it in another moment he was remembering how few such cases seemed to have ever happened in another moment he was wondering whether they ever happened and were not found out as his unusual emotion subsided these misgivings gradually melted away though so much of their shadow remained behind that he was constant in his resolution to look closely after richards himself without appearing to do so being now in an easier frame of mind he regarded the woman's station as rather an advantageous circumstance than otherwise by placing in itself a broad distance between her and the child and rendering their separation easy and natural thence he passed to the contemplation of the future glories of dombey and son and dismissed the memory of his wife for the time being with a tributary sigh or two meanwhile terms were ratified and agreed upon between mrs chick and richards with the assistance of miss tox and richards being with much ceremony invested with the dombey baby as if it were an order resigned her own with many tears and kisses to jemima glasses of wine were then produced to sustain the drooping spirits of the family and miss tox busying herself in dispensing tastes to the younger branches bred them up to their father's business with such surprising expedition that she made chokers of four of them in a quarter of a minute you'll take a glass yourself sir won't you said miss tox as toodle appeared thankee mum said toodle since you are suppressing and you're very glad to leave your dear good wife in such a comfortable home ain't you sir said miss tox nodding and winking at him stealthily no mum said toodle here's wishing of her back agin polly cried more than ever at this so mrs chick who had her matronly apprehensions that this indulgence in grief might be prejudicial to the little dombey acid indeed she whispered miss tox hastened to the rescue your little child will thrive charmingly with your sister jemima richards said mrs chick and you have only to make an effort this is a world of effort you know richards to be very happy indeed you have been already measured for your mourning haven't you richards ye es ma'am sobbed polly and it'll fit beautifully i know said mrs chick for the same young person has made me many dresses the very best materials too lor you'll be so smart said miss tox that your husband won't know you will you sir i should know her said toodle gruffly anyhows and anywheres toodle was evidently not to be bought over as to living richards you know pursued mrs chick why the very best of everything will be at your disposal you will order your little dinner every day and anything you take a fancy to i'm sure will be as readily provided as if you were a lady yes to be sure said miss tox keeping up the ball with great sympathy and as to porter quite unlimited will it not louisa oh certainly returned mrs chick in the same tone with a little abstinence you know my dear in point of vegetables and pickles perhaps suggested miss tox with such exceptions said louisa she'll consult her choice entirely and be under no restraint at all my love and then of course you know said miss tox however fond she is of her own dear little child and i'm sure louisa you don't blame her for being fond of it oh no cried mrs chick benignantly still resumed miss tox she naturally must be interested in her young charge and must consider it a privilege to see a little cherub connected with the superior classes gradually unfolding itself from day to day at one common fountain is it not so louisa most undoubtedly said mrs chick you see my love she's already quite contented and comfortable and means to say goodbye to her sister jemima and her little pets and her good honest husband with a light heart and a smile don't she my dear oh yes cried miss tox to be sure she does notwithstanding which however poor polly embraced them all round in great distress and coming to her spouse at last could not make up her mind to part from him until he gently disengaged himself at the close of the following allegorical piece of consolation polly old ooman whatever you do my darling hold up your head and fight low that's the only rule as i know on that'll carry anyone through life you always have held up your head and fought low polly do it now or bricks is no longer so god bless you polly me and j'mima will do your duty by you and with relating to your'n hold up your head and fight low polly and you can't go wrong fortified by this golden secret folly finally ran away to avoid any more particular leave taking between herself and the children but the stratagem hardly succeeded as well as it deserved for the smallest boy but one divining her intent immediately began swarming upstairs after her if that word of doubtful etymology be admissible on his arms and legs while the eldest known in the family by the name of biler in remembrance of the steam engine beat a demoniacal tattoo with his boots expressive of grief in which he was joined by the rest of the family a quantity of oranges and halfpence thrust indiscriminately on each young toodle checked the first violence of their regret and the family were speedily transported to their own home by means of the hackney coach kept in waiting for that purpose the children under the guardianship of jemima blocked up the window and dropped out oranges and halfpence all the way along mr toodle himself preferred to ride behind among the spikes as being the mode of conveyance to which he was best accustomed chapter 3 in which mr dombey as a man and a father is seen at the head
