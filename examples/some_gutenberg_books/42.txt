"1" "sir replied the servant mr hyde has a key your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man poole resumed the other musingly yes sir he do indeed said poole we have all orders to obey him i do not think i ever met mr hyde asked utterson o dear no sir he never dines here replied the butler indeed we see very little of 22 him on this side of the house he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory well good night poole good night mr utterson and the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart poor harry jekyll he thought my mind misgives me he is in deep waters he was wild when he was young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of god there is no statute of limitations ay it must be that the ghost of some old sin the cancer of some concealed disgrace punishment coming pede claudo years after memory has forgotten and self love condoned the fault and the lawyer scared by the thought brooded a while on his own past groping in all the corners of memory lest by chance some jack in the box of an old iniquity should leap to light there his past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing yet avoided and then by a return on his former subject he conceived a spark of hope this master hyde if he were studied thought he must have secrets of his own black secrets by the look of him secrets compared to which poor jekyll's worst would be like sunshine things cannot continue as they are it turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a 23 thief to harry's bedside poor harry what a wakening and the danger of it for if this hyde suspects the existence of the will he may grow impatient to inherit ay i must put my shoulder to the wheel if jekyll will but let me he added if jekyll will only let me for once more he saw before his mind's eye as clear as a transparency the strange clauses of the will 24 dr jekyll was quite at ease a fortnight later by excellent good fortune the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies all intelligent reputable men and all judges of good wine and mr utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed this was no new arrangement but a thing that had befallen many scores of times where utterson was liked he was liked well hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer when the light hearted and the loose tongued had already their foot on the threshold they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company practising for solitude sobering their minds in the man's rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety to this rule dr jekyll was no exception and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire a large well made smooth faced man of fifty with something of a slyish cast perhaps but every mark of capacity and kindness you could see by his looks that he cherished for mr utterson a sincere and warm affection 25 i have been wanting to speak to you jekyll began the latter you know that will of yours a close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful but the doctor carried it off gaily my poor utterson said he you are unfortunate in such a client i never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will unless it were that hide bound pedant lanyon at what he called my scientific heresies oh i know he's a good fellow you needn't frown an excellent fellow and i always mean to see more of him but a hide bound pedant for all that an ignorant blatant pedant i was never more disappointed in any man than lanyon you know i never approved of it pursued utterson ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic my will yes certainly i know that said the doctor a trifle sharply you have told me so well i tell you so again continued the lawyer i have been learning something of young hyde the large handsome face of dr jekyll grew pale to the very lips and there came a blackness about his eyes i do not care to hear more said he this is a matter i thought we had agreed to drop what i heard was abominable said utterson it can make no change you do not under 26 stand my position returned the doctor with a certain incoherency of manner i am painfully situated utterson my position is a very strange a very strange one it is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking jekyll said utterson you know me i am a man to be trusted make a clean breast of this in confidence and i make no doubt i can get you out of it my good utterson said the doctor this is very good of you this is downright good of you and i cannot find words to thank you in i believe you fully i would trust you before any man alive ay before myself if i could make the choice but indeed it isn't what you fancy it is not so bad as that and just to put your good heart at rest i will tell you one thing the moment i choose i can be rid of mr hyde i give you my hand upon that and i thank you again and again and i will just add one little word utterson that i'm sure you'll take in good part this is a private matter and i beg of you to let it sleep utterson reflected a little looking in the fire i have no doubt you are perfectly right he said at last getting to his feet well but since we have touched upon this business and for the last time i hope continued the doctor there is one point i should like you to understand i have really a very great interest in poor hyde i know you have seen 27 him he told me so and i fear he was rude but i do sincerely take a great a very great interest in that young man and if i am taken away utterson i wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him i think you would if you knew all and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise i can't pretend that i shall ever like him said the lawyer i don't ask that pleaded jekyll laying his hand upon the other's arm i only ask for justice i only ask you to help him for my sake when i am no longer here utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh well said he i promise 28 the carew murder case nearly a year later in the month of october 18 london was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim the details were few and startling a maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river had gone up stairs to bed about eleven although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours the early part of the night was cloudless and the lane which the maid's window overlooked was brilliantly lit by the full moon it seems she was romantically given for she sat down upon her box which stood immediately under the window and fell into a dream of musing never she used to say with streaming tears when she narrated that experience never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world and as she so sat she became aware of an aged and beautiful gentleman with white hair drawing near along the lane and advancing to meet him another and very small gentleman to whom at first she 29 paid less attention when they had come within speech which was just under the maid's eyes the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness it did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance indeed from his pointing it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way but the moon shone on his face as he spoke and the girl was pleased to watch it it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old world kindness of disposition yet with something high too as of a well founded self content presently her eye wandered to the other and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain mr hyde who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike he had in his hand a heavy cane with which he was trifling but he answered never a word and seemed to listen with an ill contained impatience and then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger stamping with his foot brandishing the cane and carrying on as the maid described it like a madman the old gentleman took a step back with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt and at that mr hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth and next moment with ape like fury he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway at the horror of these sights and sounds the maid fainted 30 it was two o'clock when she came to herself and called for the police the murderer was gone long ago but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane incredibly mangled the stick with which the deed had been done although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter the other without doubt had been carried away by the murderer a purse and a gold watch were found upon the victim but no cards or papers except a sealed and stamped envelope which he had been probably carrying to the post and which bore the name and address of mr utterson this was brought to the lawyer the next morning before he was out of bed and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances than he shot out a solemn lip i shall say nothing till i have seen the body said he this may be very serious have the kindness to wait while i dress and with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station whither the body had been carried as soon as he came into the cell he nodded yes said he i recognise him i am sorry to say that this is sir danvers carew good god sir exclaimed the officer is it possible and the next moment his eye 31 lighted up with professional ambition this will make a deal of noise he said and perhaps you can help us to the man and he briefly narrated what the maid had seen and showed the broken stick mr utterson had already quailed at the name of hyde but when the stick was laid before him he could doubt no longer broken and battered as it was he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to henry jekyll is this mr hyde a person of small stature he inquired particularly small and particularly wicked looking is what the maid calls him said the officer mr utterson reflected and then raising his head if you will come with me in my cab he said i think i can take you to his house it was by this time about nine in the morning and the first fog of the season a great chocolate coloured pall lowered over heaven but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street mr utterson beheld a marvellous number of degrees and hues of twilight for here it would be dark like the back end of evening and there would be a glow of a rich lurid brown like the light of some strange conflagration and here for a moment the fog would be quite broken up and a haggard shaft 32 of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths the dismal quarter of soho seen under these changing glimpses with its muddy ways and slatternly passengers and its lamps which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful re invasion of darkness seemed in the lawyer's eyes like a district of some city in a nightmare the thoughts of his mind besides were of the gloomiest dye and when he glanced at the companion of his drive he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's officers which may at times assail the most honest as the cab drew up before the address indicated the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street a gin palace a low french eating house a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads many ragged children huddled in the doorways and many women of different nationalities passing out key in hand to have a morning glass and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part as brown as umber and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings this was the home of henry jekyll's favourite of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling an ivory faced and silvery haired old woman opened the door she had an evil face smoothed by hypocrisy but her manners were excellent yes she said this was mr hyde's but he was not at home he had been in that night very late 33 but had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothing strange in that his habits were very irregular and he was often absent for instance it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday very well then we wish to see his rooms said the lawyer and when the woman began to declare it was impossible i had better tell you who this person is he added this is inspector newcomen of scotland yard a flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face ah said she he is in trouble what has he done mr utterson and the inspector exchanged glances he don't seem a very popular character observed the latter and now my good woman just let me and this gentleman have a look about us in the whole extent of the house which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty mr hyde had only used a couple of rooms but these were furnished with luxury and good taste a closet was filled with wine the plate was of silver the napery elegant a good picture hung upon the walls a gift as utterson supposed from henry jekyll who was much of a connoisseur and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour at this moment however the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked clothes lay about the floor with their pockets inside out 34 lock fast drawers stood open and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes as though many papers had been burned from these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book which had resisted the action of the fire the other half of the stick was found behind the door and as this clinched his suspicions the officer declared himself delighted a visit to the bank where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's credit completed his gratification you may depend upon it sir he told mr utterson i have him in my hand he must have lost his head or he never would have left the stick or above all burned the cheque book why money's life to the man we have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank and get out the handbills this last however was not so easy of accomplishment for mr hyde had numbered few familiars even the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice his family could nowhere be traced he had never been photographed and the few who could describe him differed widely as common observers will only on one point were they agreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders 35 incident of the letter it was late in the afternoon when mr utterson found his way to dr jekyll's door where he was at once admitted by poole and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or the dissecting rooms the doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden it was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friend's quarters and he eyed the dingy windowless structure with curiosity and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent the tables laden with chemical apparatus the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola at the further end a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize 36 and through this mr utterson was at last received into the doctor's cabinet it was a large room fitted round with glass presses furnished among other things with a cheval glass and a business table and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron a fire burned in the grate a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly and there close up to the warmth sat dr jekyll looking deadly sick he did not rise to meet his visitor but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice and now said mr utterson as soon as poole had left them you have heard the news the doctor shuddered they were crying it in the square he said i heard them in my dining room one word said the lawyer carew was my client but so are you and i want to know what i am doing you have not been mad enough to hide this fellow utterson i swear to god cried the doctor i swear to god i will never set eyes on him again i bind my honour to you that i am done with him in this world it is all at an end and indeed he does not want my help you do not know him as i do he is safe he is quite safe mark my words he will never more be heard of the lawyer listened gloomily he did not like his friend's feverish manner you seem pretty 37 sure of him said he and for your sake i hope you may be right if it came to a trial your name might appear i am quite sure of him replied jekyll i have grounds for certainty that i cannot share with any one but there is one thing on which you may advise me i have i have received a letter and i am at a loss whether i should show it to the police i should like to leave it in your hands utterson you would judge wisely i am sure i have so great a trust in you you fear i suppose that it might lead to his detection asked the lawyer no said the other i cannot say that i care what becomes of hyde i am quite done with him i was thinking of my own character which this hateful business has rather exposed utterson ruminated a while he was surprised at his friend's selfishness and yet relieved by it well said he at last let me see the letter the letter was written in an odd upright hand and signed edward hyde and it signified briefly enough that the writer's benefactor dr jekyll whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities need labour under no alarm for his safety as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence the lawyer liked this letter well enough it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions 38 have you the envelope he asked i burned it replied jekyll before i thought what i was about but it bore no postmark the note was handed in shall i keep this and sleep upon it asked utterson i wish you to judge for me entirely was the reply i have lost confidence in myself well i shall consider returned the lawyer and now one word more it was hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance the doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness he shut his mouth tight and nodded i knew it said utterson he meant to murder you you have had a fine escape i have had what is far more to the purpose returned the doctor solemnly i have had a lesson o god utterson what a lesson i have had and he covered his face for a moment with his hands on his way out the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with poole by the by said he there was a letter handed in to day what was the messenger like but poole was positive nothing had come except by post and only circulars by that he added this news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door possibly indeed it had been 39 written in the cabinet and if that were so it must be differently judged and handled with the more caution the newsboys as he went were crying themselves hoarse along the footways special edition shocking murder of an m p that was the funeral oration of one friend and client and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal it was at least a ticklish decision that he had to make and self reliant as he was by habit he began to cherish a longing for advice it was not to be had directly but perhaps he thought it might be fished for presently after he sat on one side of his own hearth with mr guest his head clerk upon the other and midway between at a nicely calculated distance from the fire a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house the fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds the procession of the town's life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind but the room was gay with firelight in the bottle the acids were long ago resolved the imperial dye had softened with time as the colour grows richer in stained windows and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free 40 and to disperse the fogs of london insensibly the lawyer melted there was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than mr guest and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant guest had often been on business to the doctor's he knew poole he could scarce have failed to hear of mr hyde's familiarity about the house he might draw conclusions was it not as well then that he should see a letter which put that mystery to rights and above all since guest being a great student and critic of handwriting would consider the step natural and obliging the clerk besides was a man of counsel he would scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark and by that remark mr utterson might shape his future course this is a sad business about sir danvers he said yes sir indeed it has elicited a great deal of public feeling returned guest the man of course was mad i should like to hear your views on that replied utterson i have a document here in his handwriting it is between ourselves for i scarce know what to do about it it is an ugly business at the best but there it is quite in your way a murderer's autograph guest's eyes brightened and he sat down at once and studied it with passion no sir he said not mad but it is an odd hand 41 and by all accounts a very odd writer added the lawyer just then the servant entered with a note is that from dr jekyll sir inquired the clerk i thought i knew the writing anything private mr utterson only an invitation to dinner why do you want to see it one moment i thank you sir and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents thank you sir he said at last returning both it's a very interesting autograph there was a pause during which mr utterson struggled with himself why did you compare them guest he inquired suddenly well sir returned the clerk there's a rather singular resemblance the two hands are in many points identical only differently sloped rather quaint said utterson it is as you say rather quaint returned guest i wouldn't speak of this note you know said the master no sir said the clerk i understand but no sooner was mr utterson alone that night than he locked the note into his safe where it reposed from that time forward what he thought henry jekyll forge for a murderer and his blood ran cold in his veins 42 remarkable incident of dr lanyon time ran on thousands of pounds were offered in reward for the death of sir danvers was resented as a public injury but mr hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed much of his past was unearthed indeed and all disreputable tales came out of the man's cruelty at once so callous and violent of his vile life of his strange associates of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career but of his present whereabouts not a whisper from the time he had left the house in soho on the morning of the murder he was simply blotted out and gradually as time drew on mr utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm and to grow more at quiet with himself the death of sir danvers was to his way of thinking more than paid for by the disappearance of mr hyde now that that evil influence had been withdrawn a new life began for dr jekyll he came out of his seclusion renewed relations with his friends became once more their familiar guest 43 and entertainer and whilst he had always been known for charities he was now no less distinguished for religion he was busy he was much in the open air he did good his face seemed to open and brighten as if with an inward consciousness of service and for more than two months the doctor was at peace on the 8th of january utterson had dined at the doctor's with a small party lanyon had been there and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends on the 12th and again on the 14th the door was shut against the lawyer the doctor was confined to the house poole said and saw no one on the 15th he tried again and was again refused and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits the fifth night he had in guest to dine with him and the sixth he betook himself to dr lanyon's there at least he was not denied admittance but when he came in he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor's appearance he had his death warrant written legibly upon his face the rosy man had grown pale his flesh had fallen away he was visibly balder and"
