did not see him anna maria went down by way of the skirting board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough she borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws she did not observe moppet while tom kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic he wriggled about and tried to mew for help but his mouth was full of soot and cob webs and he was tied up in such very tight knots he could not make anybody hear him except a spider which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically from a safe distance it was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue bottles it did not offer to assist him tom kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling first they smeared him with butter and then they rolled him in the dough will not the string be very indigestible anna maria inquired samuel whiskers anna maria said she thought that it was of no consequence but she wished that tom kitten would hold his head still as it disarranged the pastry she laid hold of his ears tom kitten bit and spat and mewed and wriggled and the rolling pin went roly poly roly roly poly roly the rats each held an end his tail is sticking out you did not fetch enough dough anna maria i fetched as much as i could carry replied anna maria i do not think said samuel whiskers pausing to take a look at tom kitten i do not think it will be a good pudding it smells sooty anna maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above the rasping noise of a saw and the noise of a little dog scratching and yelping the rats dropped the rolling pin and listened attentively we are discovered and interrupted anna maria let us collect our property and other people's and depart at once i fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding but i am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible whatever you may urge to the contrary come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane said anna maria i have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney so it happened that by the time john joiner had got the plank up there was nobody under the floor except the rolling pin and tom kitten in a very dirty dumpling but there was a strong smell of rats and john joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining and wagging his tail and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag and came downstairs the cat family had quite recovered they invited him to stay to dinner the dumpling had been peeled off tom kitten and made separately into a bag pudding with currants in it to hide the smuts they had been obliged to put tom kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off john joiner smelt the pudding but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner because he had just finished making a wheel barrow for miss potter and she had ordered two hen coops and when i was going to the post late in the afternoon i looked up the lane from the corner and i saw mr samuel whiskers and his wife on the run with big bundles on a little wheel barrow which looked very like mine they were just turning in at the gate to the barn of farmer potatoes samuel whiskers was puffing and out of breath anna maria was still arguing in shrill tones she seemed to know her way and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage i am sure _i_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheel barrow they went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow after that there were no more rats for a long time at tabitha twitchit's as for farmer potatoes he has been driven nearly distracted there are rats and rats and rats in his barn they eat up the chicken food and steal the oats and bran and make holes in the meal bags and they are all descended from mr and mrs samuel whiskers children and grand children and great great grand children there is no end to them moppet and mittens have grown up into very good rat catchers they go out rat catching in the village and they find plenty of employment they charge so much a dozen and earn their living very comfortably they hang up the rats tails in a row or the barn door to show how many they have caught dozens and dozens of them but tom kitten has always been afraid of a rat he never durst face anything that is bigger than a mouse the end the tale of mr tod i have made many books about well behaved people now for a change i am going to make a story about two disagreeable people called tommy brock and mr tod nobody could call mr tod nice the rabbits could not bear him they could smell him half a mile off he was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers they never knew where he would be next one day he was living in a stick house in the coppice causing terror to the family of old mr benjamin bouncer next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake frightening the wild ducks and the water rats in winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of bull banks under oatmeal crag he had half a dozen houses but he was seldom at home the houses were not always empty when mr tod moved out because sometimes tommy brock moved in without asking leave tommy brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin he grinned all over his face he was not nice in his habits he ate wasp nests and frogs and worms and he waddled about by moonlight digging things up his clothes were very dirty and as he slept in the day time he always went to bed in his boots and the bed which he went to bed in was generally mr tod's now tommy brock did occasionally eat rabbit pie but it was only very little young ones occasionally when other food was really scarce he was friendly with old mr bouncer they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and mr tod they often talked over that painful subject old mr bouncer was stricken in years he sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow in a muffler smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco he lived with his son benjamin bunny and his daughter in law flopsy who had a young family old mr bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon because benjamin and flopsy had gone out the little rabbit babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick they lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay in a shallow burrow separate from the main rabbit hole to tell the truth old mr bouncer had forgotten them he sat in the sun and conversed cordially with tommy brock who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging and some mole traps he complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants eggs and accused mr tod of poaching them and the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter i have not had a good square meal for a fortnight i am living on pig nuts i shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail said tommy brock it was not much of a joke but it tickled old mr bouncer because tommy brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning so old mr bouncer laughed and pressed tommy brock to come inside to taste a slice of seed cake and a glass of my daughter flopsy's cowslip wine tommy brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity then old mr bouncer smoked another pipe and gave tommy brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made tommy brock grin more than ever and the smoke filled the burrow old mr bouncer coughed and laughed and tommy brock puffed and grinned and mr bouncer laughed and coughed and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke when flopsy and benjamin came back old mr bouncer woke up tommy brock and all the young rabbit babies had disappeared mr bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole but the smell of badger was undeniable and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand he was in disgrace flopsy wrung her ears and slapped him benjamin bunny set off at once after tommy brock there was not much difficulty in tracking him he had left his foot mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel there he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel and had set a mole trap a little stream crossed the way benjamin skipped lightly over dry foot the badger's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud the path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared there were leafy oak stumps and a sea of blue hyacinths but the smell that made benjamin stop was not the smell of flowers mr tod's stick house was before him and for once mr tod was at home there was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney benjamin bunny sat up staring his whiskers twitched inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate and said something benjamin stamped his foot and bolted he never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood apparently tommy brock had turned the same way upon the top of the wall there were again the marks of badger and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar benjamin climbed over the wall into a meadow he found another mole trap newly set he was still upon the track of tommy brock it was getting late in the afternoon other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air one of them in a blue coat by himself was busily hunting for dandelions cousin peter peter rabbit peter rabbit shouted benjamin bunny the blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears whatever is the matter cousin benjamin is it a cat or john stoat ferret no no no he's bagged my family tommy brock in a sack have you seen him tommy brock how many cousin benjamin seven cousin peter and all of them twins did he come this way please tell me quick yes yes not ten minutes since he said they were caterpillars i did think they were kicking rather hard for caterpillars which way which way has he gone cousin peter he had a sack with something live in it i watched him set a mole trap let me use my mind cousin benjamin tell me from the beginning benjamin did so my uncle bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years said peter reflectively but there are two hopeful circumstances your family is alive and kicking and tommy brock has had refreshment he will probably go to sleep and keep them for breakfast which way cousin benjamin compose yourself i know very well which way because mr tod was at home in the stick house he has gone to mr tod's other house at the top of bull banks i partly know because he offered to leave any message at sister cottontail's he said he would be passing cottontail had married a black rabbit and gone to live on the hill peter hid his dandelions and accompanied the afflicted parent who was all of a twitter they crossed several fields and began to climb the hill the tracks of tommy brock were plainly to be seen he seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards to rest he must be very puffed we are close behind him by the scent what a nasty person said peter the sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures half way up cottontail was sitting in her doorway with four or five half grown little rabbits playing about her one black and the others brown cottontail had seen tommy brock passing in the distance asked whether her husband was at home she replied that tommy brock had rested twice while she watched him he had nodded and pointed to the sack and seemed doubled up with laughing come away peter he will be cooking them come quicker said benjamin bunny they climbed up and up he was at home i saw his black ears peeping out of the hole they live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbours come on cousin benjamin when they came near the wood at the top of bull banks they went cautiously the trees grew amongst heaped up rocks and there beneath a crag mr tod had made one of his homes it was at the top of a steep bank the rocks and bushes overhung it the rabbits crept up carefully listening and peeping this house was something between a cave a prison and a tumble down pig stye there was a strong door which was shut and locked the setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame but the kitchen fire was not alight it was neatly laid with dry sticks as the rabbits could see when they peeped through the window benjamin sighed with relief but there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder there was an immense empty pie dish of blue willow pattern and a large carving knife and fork and a chopper at the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth a plate a tumbler a knife and fork salt cellar mustard and a chair in short preparations for one person's supper no person was to be seen and no young rabbits the kitchen was empty and silent the clock had run down peter and benjamin flattened their noses against the window and stared into the dusk then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house it was damp and smelly and over grown with thorns and briars the rabbits shivered in their shoes oh my poor rabbit babies what a dreadful place i shall never see them again sighed benjamin they crept up to the bedroom window it was closed and bolted like the kitchen but there were signs that this window had been recently open the cobwebs were disturbed and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the window sill the room inside was so dark that at first they could make out nothing but they could hear a noise a slow deep regular snoring grunt and as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness they perceived that somebody was asleep on mr tod's bed curled up under the blanket he has gone to bed in his boots whispered peter benjamin who was all of a twitter pulled peter off the window sill tommy brock's snores continued grunty and regular from mr tod's bed nothing could be seen of the young family the sun had set an owl began to hoot in the wood there were many unpleasant things lying about that had much better have been buried rabbit bones and skulls and chickens legs and other horrors it was a shocking place and very dark they went back to the front of the house and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window they tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes but it was of no use especially without a light they sat side by side outside the window whispering and listening in half an hour the moon rose over the wood it shone full and clear and cold upon the house amongst the rocks and in at the kitchen window but alas no little rabbit babies were to be seen the moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor the light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace a little iron door belonging to a brick oven of that old fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood and presently at the same moment peter and benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window the little door opposite shook in answer the young family were alive shut up in the oven benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake tommy brock whose snores continued solemnly in mr tod's bed but there really was not very much comfort in the discovery they could not open the window and although the young family was alive the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out they were not old enough to crawl after much whispering peter and benjamin decided to dig a tunnel they began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank they hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags they dug and dug for hours they could not tunnel straight on account of stones but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor benjamin was on his back scratching upwards peter's claws were worn down he was outside the tunnel shuffling sand away he called out that it was morning sunrise and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods benjamin bunny came out of the dark tunnel shaking the sand from his ears he cleaned his face with his paws every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill in the valley there was a sea of white mist with golden tops of trees showing through again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jay followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox then those two rabbits lost their heads completely they did the most foolish thing that they could have done they rushed into their short new tunnel and hid themselves at the top end of it under mr tod's kitchen floor mr tod was coming up bull banks and he was in the very worst of tempers first he had been upset by breaking the plate it was his own fault but it was a china plate the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother old vixen tod then the midges had been very bad and he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest and it had contained only five eggs two of them addled mr tod had had an unsatisfactory night as usual when out of humour he determined to move house first he tried the pollard willow but it was damp and the otters had left a dead fish near it mr tod likes nobody's leavings but his own he made his way up the hill his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger no one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as tommy brock mr tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed he guessed where tommy brock had gone to he was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently it flew from tree to tree and scolded warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation once when it flew screaming over his head mr tod snapped at it and barked he approached his house very carefully with a large rusty key he sniffed and his whiskers bristled the house was locked up but mr tod had his doubts whether it was empty he turned the rusty key in the lock the rabbits below could hear it mr tod opened the door cautiously and went in the sight that met mr tod's eyes in mr tod's kitchen made mr tod furious there was mr tod's chair and mr tod's pie dish and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his table cloth that he had left folded up in the dresser all set out for supper or breakfast without doubt for that odious tommy brock there was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit but what absorbed mr tod's attention was a noise a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise coming from his own bed he peeped through the hinges of the half open bedroom door then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry his whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage for the next twenty minutes mr tod kept creeping cautiously into the house and retreating hurriedly out again by degrees he ventured further in right into the bedroom when he was outside the house he scratched up the earth with fury but when he was inside he did not like the look of tommy brock's teeth he was lying on his back with his mouth open grinning from ear to ear he snored peacefully and regularly but one eye was not perfectly shut mr tod came in and out of the bedroom twice he brought in his walking stick and once he brought in the coal scuttle but he thought better of it and took them away when he came back after removing the coal scuttle tommy brock was lying a little more sideways but he seemed even sounder asleep he was an incurably indolent person he was not in the least afraid of mr tod he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move mr tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line he stood a minute watching tommy brock and listening attentively to the snores they were very loud indeed but seemed quite natural mr tod turned his back towards the bed and undid the window it creaked he turned round with a jump tommy brock who had opened one eye shut it hastily the snores continued mr tod's proceedings were peculiar and rather uneasy because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom he opened the window a little way and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window sill the rest of the line with a hook at the end remained in his hand tommy brock snored conscientiously mr tod stood and looked at him for a minute then he left the room again tommy brock opened both eyes and looked at the rope and grinned there was a noise outside the window tommy brock shut his eyes in a hurry mr tod had gone out at the front door and round to the back of the house on the way he stumbled over the rabbit burrow if he had had any idea who was inside it he would have pulled them out quickly his foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of peter rabbit and benjamin but fortunately he thought that it was some more of tommy brock's work he took up the coil of line from the sill listened for a moment and then tied the rope to a tree tommy brock watched him with one eye through the window he was puzzled mr tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom tommy brock snored industriously with rather a snort mr tod put down the pail beside the bed took up the end of rope with the hook hesitated and looked at tommy brock the snores were almost apoplectic but the grin was not quite so big mr tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead his legs were dangerously near to tommy brock's teeth he reached up and put the end of rope with the hook over the head of the tester bed where the curtains ought to hang mr tod's curtains were folded up and put away owing to the house being unoccupied so was the counterpane tommy brock was covered with a blanket only mr tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively he really was a first prize sound sleeper it seemed as though nothing would waken him not even the flapping rope across the bed mr tod descended safely from the chair and endeavoured to get up again with the pail of water he intended to hang it from the hook dangling over the head of tommy brock in order to make a sort of shower bath worked by a string through the window but naturally being a thin legged person though vindictive and sandy whiskered he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope he very nearly overbalanced himself the snores became more and more apoplectic one of tommy brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket but still he slept on peacefully mr tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident after considerable thought he emptied the water into a wash basin and jug the empty pail was not too heavy for him he slung it up wobbling over the head of tommy brock surely there never was such a sleeper mr tod got up and down down and up on the chair as he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once he fetched a milk jug and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees the pail got fuller and fuller and swung like a pendulum occasionally a drop splashed over but still tommy brock snored regularly and never moved except one eye at last mr tod's preparations were complete the pail was full of water the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed and across the window sill to the tree outside it will make a great mess in my bedroom but i could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort said mr tod mr tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room he went out of the house shutting the front door the rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel he ran round behind the house intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon tommy brock i will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise said mr tod the moment he had gone tommy brock got up in a hurry he rolled mr tod's dressing gown into a bundle put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself and left the room also grinning immensely he went into the kitchen lighted the fire and boiled the kettle for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits when mr tod got to the tree he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying he was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth he chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes at last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out and quite knocked him over backwards inside the house there was a great crash and splash and the noise of a pail rolling over and over but no screams mr tod was mystified he sat quite still and listened attentively then he peeped in at the window the water was dripping from the bed the pail had rolled into a corner in the middle of the bed under the blanket was a wet flattened something much dinged in in the middle where the pail had caught it as it were across the tummy its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was not snoring any longer there was nothing stirring and no sound except the drip drop drop drip of water trickling from the mattress mr tod watched it for half an hour his eyes glistened then he cut a caper and became so bold that he even tapped at the window but the bundle never moved yes there was no doubt about it it had turned out even better than he had planned the pail had hit poor old tommy brock and killed him dead i will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug i will bring my bedding out and dry it in the sun said mr tod i will"
