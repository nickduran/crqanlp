"1" "hope this plunking the a is attuned to love while this one the e string gives forth sounds of joy you will observe went on the visitor noting the intense interest displayed by the violinist that the position of the strings is the same as on any other violin and therefore will require no additional study on your part but that extra string interrupted diotti designating the middle one on the violin a vague foreboding rising within him that said mephistopheles solemnly and with no pretense of sophistry is the string of death and he who plays upon it dies at once the string of death repeated the violinist almost inaudibly yes the string of death satan repeated and he who plays upon it dies at once but he added cheerfully that need not worry you i noticed a marvelous facility in your arm work your staccato and spiccato are wonderful every form of bowing appears child's play to you it will be easy for you to avoid touching the string why avoid it can it not be cut off ah that's the rub if you examine the violin closely you will find that the string of death is made up of the extra lengths of the other four strings to cut it off would destroy the others and then pity hope love and joy would cease to exist in the soul of the violin how like life itself diotti reflected pity hope love joy end in death and through death they are born again that's the idea precisely said satan evidently relieved by diotti's logic and quick perception the violinist examined the instrument with the practised eye of an expert and turning to satan said the four strings are beautifully white and transparent but this one is black and odd looking what is it wrapped with eagerly inquired diotti examining the death string with microscopic care the fifth string was added after an unfortunate episode in the garden of eden in which i was somewhat concerned said satan soberly it is wrapped with strands of hair from the first mother of man impressively then he offered the violin to diotti i dare not take it said the perplexed musician it's from yes it is directly from there but i brought it from heaven when i i left said the fallen angel with remorse in his voice it was my constant companion there but no one in my domain not i myself can play upon it now for it will respond neither to our longing for pity hope love joy nor even death and sadly and retrospectively satan gazed into vacancy then after a long pause try the instrument diotti placed the violin in position and drew the bow across the string of joy improvising on it almost instantly the birds of the forest darted hither and thither caroling forth in gladsome strains the devil alone was sad and with emotion said it is many many years since i have heard that string next the artist changed to the string of pity and thoughts of the world's sorrows came over him like a pall wonderful most wonderful said the mystified violinist with this instrument i can conquer the world aye more to you than the world said the tempter a woman's love a woman's love to the despairing suitor there was one and only one in this wide wide world and her words burning their way into his heart had made this temptation possible no drooping clytie could be more constant than i to him who strikes the chord that is responsive in my soul holding the violin aloft he cried exultingly henceforth thou art mine though death and oblivion lurk ever near thee vii perkins seated in his office threw the morning paper aside it's no use he said turning to the office boy i don't believe they ever will find him dead or alive whoever put up the job on diotti was a past grand master at that sort of thing the silent assassin that lurks in the shadow of the midnight moon is an explosion of dynamite compared to the party that made way with diotti you ask why should they kill him my boy you don't know the world they were jealous of his enormous hit of our dazzling success jealousy did it the they of perkins comprised rival managers rival artists newspaper critics and everybody at large who would not concede that the attractions managed by perkins were the greatest on earth we'll never see his like again come in this last in answer to a knock diotti appeared at the open door perkins jumped like one shot from a catapult and rushing toward the silent figure in the doorway exclaimed bless my soul are you a ghost a substantial one said diotti with a smile are you really here continued the astonished impresario using diotti's arm as a pump handle and pinching him at the same time when they were seated perkins plied diotti with all manner of questions how did it happen how did you escape and the like all of which diotti parried with monosyllabic replies finally saying i was dissatisfied with my playing and went away to study do you know that the failure to fulfill your contract has cost me at least ten thousand dollars said the shrewd manager the commercial side of his nature asserting itself all of which i will pay quietly replied the artist besides i am ready to play now and you can announce a concert within a week if you like if i like cried the hustling perkins here james calling his office boy run down to the printer's and give him this making a note of the various sizes of paper he desired and tell mr tompkins that diotti is back and will give a concert next tuesday tell smith to prepare the newspaper ads and notices immediately in an hour perkins had the entire machinery of his office in motion within twenty four hours new york had several versions of the disappearance and return all leading to one common point that diotti would give a concert the coming tuesday evening the announcement of the reappearance of the tuscan contained a line to the effect that the violinist would play for the first time his new suite a meditation on the emotions he had not seen mildred as he came upon the stage that night the lights were turned low and naught but the shadowy outlines of player and violin were seen his reception by the audience was not enthusiastic they evidently remembered the disappointment caused by his unexpected disappearance but this unfriendly attitude soon gave way to evidences of kindlier feelings mildred was there more beautiful than ever and to gain her love diotti would have bartered his soul that moment the first movement of the suite was entitled pity and the music flowed like melodious tears a subdued sob rose and fell with the sadness of the theme mildred's eyes were moistened as she fixed them on the lone figure of the player now the theme of pity changed to hope and hearts grew brighter under the spell the next movement depicted joy as the virtuoso's fingers darted here and there his music seemed the very laughter of fairy voices the earth looked roses and sunshine and mildred relaxing her position and leaning forward in the box with lips slightly parted was the picture of eager happiness the final movement came its subject was love the introduction depicted the arcadian beauty of the trysting place love lit eyes sought each other intuitively and a great peace brooded over the hearts of all then followed the song of the passionate pilgrim if music and sweet poetry agree as they must needs the sister and the brother when must the love be great twixt thee and me because thou lov'st the one and i the other thou lov'st to hear the sweet melodious sound that phoebus lute the queen of music makes and i in deep delight am chiefly drown'd when as himself to singing he betakes one god is god of both as poets one knight loves both and both in thee remain grander and grander the melody rose voicing love's triumph with wondrous sweetness and palpitating rhythm mildred her face flushed with excitement a heavenly fire in her eyes and in an attitude of supplication reveled in the glory of a new found emotion as the violinist concluded his performance an oppressive silence pervaded the house then the audience wild with excitement burst into thunders of applause in his dressing room diotti was besieged by hosts of people congratulating him in extravagant terms mildred wallace came extending her hands he took them almost reverently she looked into his eyes and he knew he had struck the chord responsive in her soul viii the sun was high in the heavens when the violinist awoke a great weight had been lifted from his heart he had passed from darkness into dawn a messenger brought him this note my dear signor diotti i am at home this afternoon and shall be delighted to see you and return my thanks for the exquisite pleasure you gave me last evening music such as yours is indeed the voice of heaven sincerely mildred wallace the messenger returned with this reply my dear miss wallace i will call at three to day gratefully angelo diotti he watched the hour drag from eleven to twelve then counted the minutes to one and from that time until he left the hotel each second was tabulated in his mind arriving at her residence he was ushered into the drawing room it was fragrant with the perfume of violets and he stood gazing at her portrait expectant of her coming dressed in simple white entrancing in her youthful freshness she entered her face glowing with happiness her eyes languorous and expressive she hastened to him offering both hands he held them in a loving tender grasp and for a moment neither spoke then she gazing clearly and fearlessly into his eyes said my heart has found its melody he kneeling like sir gareth of old the song and the singer are yours forever she bidding him arise and i forever yours and wondering at her boldness she added i know and feel that you love me your eyes confirmed your love before you spoke then convincingly and ingenuously i knew you loved me the moment we first met then i did not understand what that meant to you now i do he drew her gently to him and the motive of their happiness was defined in sweet confessions my love my life my life my love the magic of his music had changed her very being the breath of love was in her soul the vision of love was dancing in her eyes the child of marble like the statue of old had come to life and not long since i was a cold dull stone i recollect that by some means i knew that i was stone that was the first dull gleam of consciousness i became conscious of a chilly self a cold immovable identity i knew that i was stone and knew no more then by an imperceptible advance came the dim evidence of outer things seen darkly and imperfectly yet seen the walls surrounding me and i alone that pedestal that curtain then a voice that called on galatea at that word which seemed to shake my marble to the core that which was dim before came evident sounds that had hummed around me indistinct vague meaningless seemed to resolve themselves into a language i could understand i felt my frame pervaded by a glow that seemed to thaw my marble into flesh its cold hard substance throbbed with active life my limbs grew supple and i moved i lived lived in the ecstasy of a new born life lived in the love of him that fashioned me lived in a thousand tangled thoughts of hope day after day he came they told their love their hopes their ambitions she assumed absolute proprietorship in him she gloried in her possession he was born into the world nurtured in infancy trained in childhood and matured into manhood for one express purpose to be hers alone her ownership ranged from absolute despotism to humble slavery and he was happy through it all one day she said angelo is it your purpose to follow your profession always necessarily it is my livelihood he replied but do you not think that after we stand at the altar we never should be separated we will be together always said he holding her face between his palms and looking with tender expression into her inquiring eyes but i notice that women cluster around you after your concerts and shake your hand longer than they should and talk to you longer than they should and go away looking self satisfied she replied brokenly much as a little girl tells of the theft of her doll nonsense he said smiling that is all part of my profession it is not me they care for it is the music i give that makes them happy if in my playing i achieve results out of the common they admire me and he kissed away the unwelcome tears i know she continued but lately since we have loved each other i can not bear to see a woman near you in my dreams again and again an indefinable shadow mockingly comes and cries to me he is not to be yours he is to be mine diotti flushed and drew her to him darling his voice carrying conviction i am yours you are mine all in all in life here and beyond and as she sat dreaming after he had gone she murmured petulantly i wish there were no other women in the world her father was expected from europe on the succeeding day's steamer mr wallace was a busy man the various gigantic enterprises he served as president or director occupied most of his time he had been absent in europe for several months and mildred was anxiously awaiting his return to tell him of her love when mr wallace came to his residence the next morning his daughter met him with a fond display of filial affection they walked into the drawing room hand in hand he saw a picture of the violinist on the piano who's the handsome young fellow he asked looking at the portrait with the satisfaction a man feels when he sees a splendid type of his own sex that is angelo diotti the famous violinist she said but she could not add another word as they strolled through the rooms he noticed no less than three likenesses of the tuscan and as they passed her room he saw still another on the chiffonnier seems to me the house is running wild with photographs of that fiddler he said for the first time in her life she was self conscious i will wait for a more opportune time to tell him she thought in the scheme of diotti's appearance in new york there were to be two more concerts one was to be given that evening mildred coaxed her father to accompany her to hear the violinist mr wallace was not fond of music it had been knocked out of him on the farm up in vermont when he was a boy he would apologetically explain and besides he had the old puritanical abhorrence of stage people putting them all in one class as puppets who danced for played or talked for an idle and unthinking public so it was with the thought of a wasted evening that he accompanied mildred to the concert the entertainment was a repetition of the others diotti had given and at its end mildred said to her father come i want to congratulate signor diotti in person that is entirely unnecessary he replied it is my desire and the girl led the unwilling parent back of the scenes and into diotti's dressing room mildred introduced diotti to her father who after a few commonplaces lapsed into silence the daughter's enthusiastic interest in diotti's performance and her tender solicitude for his weariness after the efforts of the evening quickly attracted the attention of mr wallace and irritated him exceedingly when father and daughter were seated in their carriage and were hurriedly driving home he said mildred i prefer that you have as little to say to that man as possible what do you object to in him she asked everything of what use is a man who dawdles away his time on a fiddle of what benefit is he to mankind do fiddlers build cities do they delve into the earth for precious metals do they sow the seed and harvest the grain no no they are drones the barnacles of society father how can you advance such an argument music's votaries offer no apologies for their art the husbandman places the grain within the breast of mother earth for man's material welfare god places music in the heart of man for his spiritual development in man's spring time his bridal day music means joy in man's winter time his burial day music means comfort the heaven born muse has added to the happiness of the world diotti is a great genius his art brings rest and tranquillity to the wearied and despairing and she did not speak again until they had reached the house the lights were turned low when father and daughter went into the drawing room mr wallace felt that he had failed to convince mildred of the utter worthlessness of fiddlers big or little and as one dissatisfied with the outcome of a contest re entered the lists he has visited you yes father often yes father spoken calmly often louder and more imperiously repeated the father as if there must be some mistake quite often and she sat down knowing the catechizing would be likely to continue for some minutes how many times do you think she rose walked into the hallway took the card basket from the table returned and seated herself beside her father emptying its contents into her lap she picked up a card it read angelo diotti and she called the name aloud she took up another and again her lips voiced the beloved name angelo diotti she continued repeating at intervals for a minute then looking at her father he has called thirty two times there are thirty one cards here and on one occasion he forgot his card case thirty two said the father rising angrily and pacing the floor yes thirty two i remember all of them distinctly her father came over to her half coaxingly half seriously mildred i wish his visits to cease people will imagine there is a romantic attachment between you there is father out it came he loves me and i love him what shouted mr wallace and then severely this must cease immediately she rose quietly and led her father over to the mantel placing a hand on each of his shoulders she said father i will obey you implicitly if you can name a reasonable objection to the man i love but you can not i love him with my whole soul i love him for the nobility of his character and because there is none other in the world for him nor for me ix old sanders as boy and man had been in the employ of the banking and brokerage firm of wallace brothers for two generations the firm gradually had advanced his position until now he was confidential adviser and general manager besides having an interest in the profits of the business he enjoyed the friendship of mr wallace and had been a constant visitor at his house from the first days of that gentleman's married life he himself was alone in the world a confirmed bachelor he had seen mildred creep from babyhood into childhood and bud from girlhood to womanhood to mildred he was one of that numerous army of brevet relations known as gran pop pop or uncle to her he was uncle sanders if the old man had one touch of human nature in him it was a solicitude for mildred's future an authority arrogated to himself to see that she married the right man but even that was directed to her material gain in this world's goods and not to any sentimental consideration for her happiness he flattered himself that by timely suggestion he had stumped at least half a dozen would be candidates for mildred's hand he pooh poohed love as a necessity for marital felicity and would enforce his argument by quoting from the bard all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one you can get at a man's income he would say but not at his heart love without money won't travel as far as money without love and many married people whose bills were overdue wondered if the old fellow was not right he was cold blooded and generally disliked by the men under him the more evil minded gossips in the bank said he was in league with old nick that of course was absurd for it does not necessarily follow because a man suggests a means looking to an end disreputable though it be that he has mephistopheles for a silent partner the conservative element among the employees would not openly venture so far but rather thought if his satanic majesty and old sanders ran a race the former would come in a bad second if he were not distanced altogether the old man always reached the office at nine mr wallace usually arrived a half hour later seldom earlier which was so well understood by sanders that he was greatly surprised when he walked into the president's office the morning after that gentleman had attended diotti's concert to find the head of the firm already there and apparently waiting for him sanders said the banker i want your advice on a matter of great importance and concern to me sanders came across the room and stood beside the desk briefly as possible i am much exercised about my daughter the old man moved up a chair and buried himself in it pressing his elbows tightly against his sides he drew his neck in and with the tips of his right hand fingers consorted and coquetted with their like on the opposite hand then he simply asked who is the man he is the violinist who has created such a sensation here angelo diotti yes i've seen the name in print returned the old man he has bewitched mildred i never have seen her show the least interest in a man before she never has appeared to me as an impressionable girl or one that could easily be won that is very true ejaculated sanders she always seemed tractable and open to reason in all questions of love and courting i can recall several instances where i have set her right by my estimation of men and invariably she has accepted my views and mine until now said the father and then he recounted his experience of the night before i had hoped she would not fall in love but be a prop and comfort to me now that i am alone i am dismayed at the prospect before me then the old man mused in the chrysalis state of girlhood a parent arranges all the details of his daughter's future when and whom she shall marry i shall not allow her to fall in love until she is twenty three says the fond parent i shall not allow her to marry until she is twenty six says the fond parent the man she marries will be the one i approve of and then she will live happy ever after concludes the fond parent deluded parent false prophet the anarchist love steps in and disdains all laws rules and regulations when finally the father confronts the defying daughter she calmly says well what are you going to do about it and then tears forgiveness complete capitulation and sometimes she and her husband live happily ever afterwards we must find some means to end this attachment a union between a musician and my daughter would be most mortifying to me some plan must be devised to separate them but she must not know of it for she is impatient of restraint and will not brook opposition are you confident she really loves this violinist she confessed as much to me said the perturbed banker old sanders tapped with both hands on his shining cranium and asked are you confident he loves her no even if he does not he no doubt makes the pretense and she believes him a man who fiddles for money is not likely to ignore an opportunity to angle for the same commodity and the banker with a look of scorn on his face threw himself back into the chair does she know that you do not approve of this man i told her that i desired the musician's visits to cease and her answer she said she would obey me if i could name one reasonable objection to the man and then with an air of absolute confidence in the impossibility of such a contingency added but you can not yes but you must said sanders mildred is strangely constituted if she loves this man her love can be more deadly to the choice of her heart than her hate to one she abhors the impatience of restraint you speak of and her very inability to brook opposition can be turned to good account now and old sanders again tapped in the rhythm of a dirge on his parchment bound cranium your plan eagerly asked the father whose confidence in his secretary was absolute i would like to study them together your position will be stronger with mildred if you show no open opposition to the man or his aspirations bring us together at your house some evening and if i can not enter a wedge of discontent then they are not as others mildred was delighted when her father told her on his return in the evening that he was anxious to meet signor diotti and suggested a dinner party within a few days he said he would invite mr sanders as that gentleman no doubt would consider it a great privilege to meet the famous musician mildred immediately sent an invitation to diotti adding a request that he bring his violin and play for uncle sanders as the latter had found it impossible to attend his concerts during the season yet was fond of music especially violin music x the little dinner party passed off pleasantly and as old sanders lighted his cigar he confided to diotti with a braggart's assurance that when he was a youngster he was the best fiddler for twenty miles around i tell you there is nothing like a fiddler to catch a petticoat he said with a sharp nudge of his elbow into diotti's ribs when i played the devil's dream there wasn't a girl in the country could keep from dancing and rosalie the prairie flower brought them on their knees to me every time then after a pause i don't believe people fiddle as well nowadays as they did in the good old times and he actually sighed in remembrance mildred smiled and whispered to diotti he took his violin from the case and began playing it seemed to her as if from above showers of silvery merriment were falling to earth the old man watched intently and as the player changed from joy to pity from love back to happiness sanders never withdrew his gaze his bead like eyes followed the artist he saw each individual finger rise and fall and the bow bound over the finger board always avoiding never coming in contact with the middle string suddenly the old man beat a tattoo on his cranium and closed his eyes apparently deep in thought as diotti ceased playing sanders applauded vociferously and moving toward the violinist said magnificent i never have heard better playing what is the make of your violin diotti startled at this question hurriedly put the instrument in its case oh it is a famous make he drawled will you let me examine it said the elder placing his hand on the case i never allow any one to touch my violin replied diotti closing the cover quickly why is there a magic charm about it that you fear other hands may discover queried the old man i prefer that no one handle it said the virtuoso commandingly very well sighed the old man resignedly there are violins and violins and no doubt yours comes within that category this half sneeringly uncle interposed mildred tactfully you must not be so persistent signor diotti prizes his violin highly and will not allow any one to play upon it but himself and the look of relief on diotti's face amply repaid her mr wallace came in at that moment and with perfunctory interest in his guest invited him to examine the splendid collection of revolutionary relics in his study i value them highly said the banker both for patriotic and ancestral reasons the wallaces fought and died for their country and helped to make this land what it is the father and the"
