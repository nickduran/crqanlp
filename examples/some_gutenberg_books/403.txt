daughter had been to the theatre the performance had been one which delighted miss hope and which satisfied her father because he loved to hear her laugh mr langham was the slave of his own good fortune by instinct and education he was a man of leisure and culture but the wealth he had inherited was like an unruly child that needed his constant watching and in keeping it well in hand he had become a man of business with time for nothing else alice langham on her return from mrs porter's dinner found him in his study engaged with a game of solitaire while hope was kneeling on a chair beside him with her elbows on the table mr langham had been troubled with insomnia of late and so it often happened that when alice returned from a ball she would find him sitting with a novel or his game of solitaire and hope who had crept downstairs from her bed dozing in front of the open fire and keeping him silent company the father and the younger daughter were very close to one another and had grown especially so since his wife had died and his son and heir had gone to college this fourth member of the family was a great bond of sympathy and interest between them and his triumphs and escapades at yale were the chief subjects of their conversation it was told by the directors of a great western railroad who had come to new york to discuss an important question with mr langham that they had been ushered downstairs one night into his basement where they had found the president of the board and his daughter hope working out a game of football on the billiard table they had chalked it off into what corresponded to five yard lines and they were hurling twenty two chess men across it in flying wedges and practising the several tricks which young langham had intrusted to his sister under an oath of secrecy the sight filled the directors with the horrible fear that business troubles had turned the president's mind but after they had sat for half an hour perched on the high chairs around the table while hope excitedly explained the game to them they decided that he was wiser than they knew and each left the house regretting he had no son worthy enough to bring that young girl into the far west you are home early said mr langham as alice stood above him pulling at her gloves i thought you said you were going on to some dance i was tired his daughter answered well when i'm out commented hope i won't come home at eleven o'clock alice always was a quitter a what asked the older sister tell us what you had for dinner said hope i know it isn't nice to ask she added hastily but i always like to know i don't remember miss langham answered smiling at her father except that he was very much sunburned and had most perplexing eyes oh of course assented hope i suppose you mean by that that you talked with some man all through dinner well i think there is a time for everything father interrupted miss langham do you know many engineers i mean do you come in contact with them through the railroads and mines you have an interest in i am rather curious about them she said lightly they seem to be a most picturesque lot of young men engineers of course said mr langham vaguely with the ten of spades held doubtfully in air sometimes we have to depend upon them altogether we decide from what the engineering experts tell us whether we will invest in a thing or not i don't think i mean the big men of the profession said his daughter doubtfully i mean those who do the rough work the men who dig the mines and lay out the railroads do you know any of them some of them said mr langham leaning back and shuffling the cards for a new game why did you ever hear of a mr robert clay mr langham smiled as he placed the cards one above the other in even rows very often he said he sails to morrow to open up the largest iron deposits in south america he goes for the valencia mining company valencia is the capital of olancho one of those little republics down there do you are you interested in that company asked miss langham seating herself before the fire and holding out her hands toward it does mr clay know that you are yes i am interested in it mr langham replied studying the cards before him but i don't think clay knows it nobody knows it yet except the president and the other officers he lifted a card and put it down again in some indecision it's generally supposed to be operated by a company but all the stock is owned by one man as a matter of fact my dear children exclaimed mr langham as he placed a deuce of clubs upon a deuce of spades with a smile of content the valencia mining company is your beloved father oh said miss langham as she looked steadily into the fire hope tapped her lips gently with the back of her hand to hide the fact that she was sleepy and nudged her father's elbow you shouldn't have put the deuce there she said you should have used it to build with on the ace ii a year before mrs porter's dinner a tramp steamer on her way to the capital of brazil had steered so close to the shores of olancho that her solitary passenger could look into the caverns the waves had tunnelled in the limestone cliffs along the coast the solitary passenger was robert clay and he made a guess that the white palisades which fringed the base of the mountains along the shore had been forced up above the level of the sea many years before by some volcanic action olancho as many people know is situated on the northeastern coast of south america and its shores are washed by the main equatorial current from the deck of a passing vessel you can obtain but little idea of olancho or of the abundance and tropical beauty which lies hidden away behind the rampart of mountains on her shore you can see only their desolate dark green front and the white caves at their base into which the waves rush with an echoing roar and in and out of which fly continually thousands of frightened bats the mining engineer on the rail of the tramp steamer observed this peculiar formation of the coast with listless interest until he noted when the vessel stood some thirty miles north of the harbor of valencia that the limestone formation had disappeared and that the waves now beat against the base of the mountains themselves there were five of these mountains which jutted out into the ocean and they suggested roughly the five knuckles of a giant hand clenched and lying flat upon the surface of the water they extended for seven miles and then the caverns in the palisades began again and continued on down the coast to the great cliffs that guard the harbor of olancho's capital the waves tunnelled their way easily enough until they ran up against those five mountains mused the engineer and then they had to fall back he walked to the captain's cabin and asked to look at a map of the coast line i believe i won't go to rio he said later in the day i think i will drop off here at valencia so he left the tramp steamer at that place and disappeared into the interior with an ox cart and a couple of pack mules and returned to write a lengthy letter from the consul's office to a mr langham in the united states knowing he was largely interested in mines and in mining there are five mountains filled with ore clay wrote which should be extracted by open faced workings i saw great masses of red hematite lying exposed on the side of the mountain only waiting a pick and shovel and at one place there were five thousand tons in plain sight i should call the stuff first class bessemer ore running about sixty three per cent metallic iron the people know it is there but have no knowledge of its value and are too lazy to ever work it themselves as to transportation it would only be necessary to run a freight railroad twenty miles along the sea coast to the harbor of valencia and dump your ore from your own pier into your own vessels it would not i think be possible to ship direct from the mines themselves even though as i say the ore runs right down into the water because there is no place at which it would be safe for a large vessel to touch i will look into the political side of it and see what sort of a concession i can get for you i should think ten per cent of the output would satisfy them and they would of course admit machinery and plant free of duty six months after this communication had arrived in new york city the valencia mining company was formally incorporated and a man named van antwerp with two hundred workmen and a half dozen assistants was sent south to lay out the freight railroad to erect the dumping pier and to strip the five mountains of their forests and underbrush it was not a task for a holiday but a stern difficult and perplexing problem and van antwerp was not quite the man to solve it he was stubborn self confident and indifferent by turns he did not depend upon his lieutenants but jealously guarded his own opinions from the least question or discussion and at every step he antagonized the easy going people among whom he had come to work he had no patience with their habits of procrastination and he was continually offending their lazy good nature and their pride he treated the rich planters who owned the land between the mines and the harbor over which the freight railroad must run with as little consideration as he showed the regiment of soldiers which the government had farmed out to the company to serve as laborers in the mines six months after van antwerp had taken charge at valencia clay who had finished the railroad in mexico of which king had spoken was asked by telegraph to undertake the work of getting the ore out of the mountains he had discovered and shipping it north he accepted the offer and was given the title of general manager and resident director and an enormous salary and was also given to understand that the rough work of preparation had been accomplished and that the more important service of picking up the five mountains and putting them in fragments into tramp steamers would continue under his direction he had a letter of recall for van antwerp and a letter of introduction to the minister of mines and agriculture further than that he knew nothing of the work before him but he concluded from the fact that he had been paid the almost prohibitive sum he had asked for his services that it must be important or that he had reached that place in his career when he could stop actual work and live easily as an expert on the work of others clay rolled along the coast from valencia to the mines in a paddle wheeled steamer that had served its usefulness on the mississippi and which had been rotting at the levees in new orleans when van antwerp had chartered it to carry tools and machinery to the mines and to serve as a private launch for himself it was a choice either of this steamer and landing in a small boat or riding along the line of the unfinished railroad on horseback either route consumed six valuable hours and clay who was anxious to see his new field of action beat impatiently upon the rail of the rolling tub as it wallowed in the sea he spent the first three days after his arrival at the mines in the mountains climbing them on foot and skirting their base on horseback and sleeping where night overtook him van antwerp did not accompany him on his tour of inspection through the mines but delegated that duty to an engineer named macwilliams and to weimer the united states consul at valencia who had served the company in many ways and who was in its closest confidence for three days the men toiled heavily over fallen trunks and trees slippery with the moss of centuries or slid backward on the rolling stones in the waterways or clung to their ponies backs to dodge the hanging creepers at times for hours together they walked in single file bent nearly double and seeing nothing before them but the shining backs and shoulders of the negroes who hacked out the way for them to go and again they would come suddenly upon a precipice and drink in the soft cool breath of the ocean and look down thousands of feet upon the impenetrable green under which they had been crawling out to where it met the sparkling surface of the caribbean sea it was three days of unceasing activity while the sun shone and of anxious questionings around the camp fire when the darkness fell and when there were no sounds on the mountain side but that of falling water in a distant ravine or the calls of the night birds on the morning of the fourth day clay and his attendants returned to camp and rode to where the men had just begun to blast away the sloping surface of the mountain as clay passed between the zinc sheds and palm huts of the soldier workmen they came running out to meet him and one who seemed to be a leader touched his bridle and with his straw sombrero in his hand begged for a word with el senor the director the news of clay's return had reached the opening and the throb of the dummy engines and the roar of the blasting ceased as the assistant engineers came down the valley to greet the new manager they found him seated on his horse gazing ahead of him and listening to the story of the soldier whose fingers as he spoke trembled in the air with all the grace and passion of his southern nature while back of him his companions stood humbly in a silent chorus with eager supplicating eyes clay answered the man's speech curtly with a few short words in the spanish patois in which he had been addressed and then turned and smiled grimly upon the expectant group of engineers he kept them waiting for some short space while he looked them over carefully as though he had never seen them before well gentlemen he said i'm glad to have you here all together i am only sorry you didn't come in time to hear what this fellow has had to say i don't as a rule listen that long to complaints but he told me what i have seen for myself and what has been told me by others i have been here three days now and i assure you gentlemen that my easiest course would be to pack up my things and go home on the next steamer i was sent down here to take charge of a mine in active operation and i find what i find that in six months you have done almost nothing and that the little you have condescended to do has been done so badly that it will have to be done over again that you have not only wasted a half year of time and i can't tell how much money but that you have succeeded in antagonizing all the people on whose good will we are absolutely dependent you have allowed your machinery to rust in the rain and your workmen to rot with sickness you have not only done nothing but you haven't a blue print to show me what you meant to do i have never in my life come across laziness and mismanagement and incompetency upon such a magnificent and reckless scale you have not built the pier you have not opened the freight road you have not taken out an ounce of ore you know more of valencia than you know of these mines you know it from the alameda to the canal you can tell me what night the band plays in the plaza but you can't give me the elevation of one of these hills you have spent your days on the pavements in front of cafes and your nights in dance halls and you have been drawing salaries every month i've more respect for these half breeds that you've allowed to starve in this fever bed than i have for you you have treated them worse than they'd treat a dog and if any of them die it's on your heads you have put them in a fever camp which you have not even taken the trouble to drain your commissariat is rotten and you have let them drink all the rum they wanted there is not one of you the group of silent men broke and one of them stepped forward and shook his forefinger at clay no man can talk to me like that he said warningly and think i'll work under him i resign here and now you what cried clay you resign he whirled his horse round with a dig of his spur and faced them how dare you talk of resigning i'll pack the whole lot of you back to new york on the first steamer if i want to and i'll give you such characters that you'll be glad to get a job carrying a transit you're in no position to talk of resigning yet not one of you yes he added interrupting himself one of you is macwilliams the man who had charge of the railroad it's no fault of his that the road's not working i understand that he couldn't get the right of way from the people who owned the land but i have seen what he has done and his plans and i apologize to him to macwilliams as for the rest of you i'll give you a month's trial it will be a month before the next steamer could get here anyway and i'll give you that long to redeem yourselves at the end of that time we will have another talk but you are here now only on your good behavior and on my sufferance good morning as clay had boasted he was not the man to throw up his position because he found the part he had to play was not that of leading man but rather one of general utility and although it had been several years since it had been part of his duties to oversee the setting up of machinery and the policing of a mining camp he threw himself as earnestly into the work before him as though to show his subordinates that it did not matter who did the work so long as it was done the men at first were sulky resentful and suspicious but they could not long resist the fact that clay was doing the work of five men and five different kinds of work not only without grumbling but apparently with the keenest pleasure he conciliated the rich coffee planters who owned the land which he wanted for the freight road by calls of the most formal state and dinners of much less formality for he saw that the iron mine had its social as well as its political side and with this fact in mind he opened the railroad with great ceremony and much music and feasting and the first piece of ore taken out of the mine was presented to the wife of the minister of the interior in a cluster of diamonds which made the wives of the other members of the cabinet regret that their husbands had not chosen that portfolio six months followed of hard unremitting work during which time the great pier grew out into the bay from macwilliams railroad and the face of the first mountain was scarred and torn of its green and left in mangled nakedness while the ringing of hammers and picks and the racking blasts of dynamite and the warning whistles of the dummy engines drove away the accumulated silence of centuries it had been a long uphill fight and clay had enjoyed it mightily two unexpected events had contributed to help it one was the arrival in valencia of young teddy langham who came ostensibly to learn the profession of which clay was so conspicuous an example and in reality to watch over his father's interests he was put at clay's elbow and clay made him learn in spite of himself for he ruled him and macwilliams of both of whom he was very fond as though so they complained they were the laziest and the most rebellious members of his entire staff the second event of importance was the announcement made one day by young langham that his father's physician had ordered rest in a mild climate and that he and his daughters were coming in a month to spend the winter in valencia and to see how the son and heir had developed as a man of business the idea of mr langham's coming to visit olancho to inspect his new possessions was not a surprise to clay it had occurred to him as possible before especially after the son had come to join them there the place was interesting and beautiful enough in itself to justify a visit and it was only a ten days voyage from new york but he had never considered the chance of miss langham's coming and when that was now not only possible but a certainty he dreamed of little else he lived as earnestly and toiled as indefatigably as before but the place was utterly transformed for him he saw it now as she would see it when she came even while at the same time his own eyes retained their point of view it was as though he had lengthened the focus of a glass and looked beyond at what was beautiful and picturesque instead of what was near at hand and practicable he found himself smiling with anticipation of her pleasure in the orchids hanging from the dead trees high above the opening of the mine and in the parrots hurling themselves like gayly colored missiles among the vines and he considered the harbor at night with its colored lamps floating on the black water as a scene set for her eyes he planned the dinners that he would give in her honor on the balcony of the great restaurant in the plaza on those nights when the band played and the senoritas circled in long lines between admiring rows of officers and caballeros and he imagined how when the ore boats had been filled and his work had slackened he would be free to ride with her along the rough mountain roads between magnificent pillars of royal palms or to venture forth in excursions down the bay to explore the caves and to lunch on board the rolling paddle wheel steamer which he would have re painted and gilded for her coming he pictured himself acting as her guide over the great mines answering her simple questions about the strange machinery and the crew of workmen and the local government by which he ruled two thousand men it was not on account of any personal pride in the mines that he wanted her to see them it was not because he had discovered and planned and opened them that he wished to show them to her but as a curious spectacle that he hoped would give her a moment's interest but his keenest pleasure was when young langham suggested that they should build a house for his people on the edge of the hill that jutted out over the harbor and the great ore pier if this were done langham urged it would be possible for him to see much more of his family than he would be able to do were they installed in the city five miles away we can still live in the office at this end of the railroad the boy said and then we shall have them within call at night when we get back from work but if they are in valencia it will take the greater part of the evening going there and all of the night getting back for i can't pass that club under three hours it will keep us out of temptation yes exactly said clay with a guilty smile it will keep us out of temptation so they cleared away the underbrush and put a double force of men to work on what was to be the most beautiful and comfortable bungalow on the edge of the harbor it had blue and green and white tiles on the floors and walls of bamboo and a red roof of curved tiles to let in the air and dragons heads for water spouts and verandas as broad as the house itself there was an open court in the middle hung with balconies looking down upon a splashing fountain and to decorate this patio they levied upon people for miles around for tropical plants and colored mats and awnings they cut down the trees that hid the view of the long harbor leading from the sea into valencia and planted a rampart of other trees to hide the iron ore pier and they sodded the raw spots where the men had been building until the place was as completely transformed as though a fairy had waved her wand above it it was to be a great surprise and they were all clay macwilliams and langham as keenly interested in it as though each were preparing it for his honeymoon they would be walking together in valencia when one would say we ought to have that for the house and without question they would march into the shop together and order whatever they fancied to be sent out to the house of the president of the mines on the hill they stocked it with wine and linens and hired a volante and six horses and fitted out the driver with a new pair of boots that reached above his knees and a silver jacket and a sombrero that was so heavy with braid that it flashed like a halo about his head in the sunlight and he was ordered not to wear it until the ladies came under penalty of arrest it delighted clay to find that it was only the beautiful things and the fine things of his daily routine that suggested her to him as though she could not be associated in his mind with anything less worthy and he kept saying to himself she will like this view from the end of the terrace and this will be her favorite walk or she will swing her hammock here and i know she will not fancy the rug that weimer chose while this fairy palace was growing the three men lived as roughly as before in the wooden hut at the terminus of the freight road three hundred yards below the house and hidden from it by an impenetrable rampart of brush and spanish bayonet there was a rough road leading from it to the city five miles away which they had extended still farther up the hill to the palms which was the name langham had selected for his father's house and when it was finally finished they continued to live under the corrugated zinc roof of their office building and locking up the palms left it in charge of a gardener and a watchman until the coming of its rightful owners it had been a viciously hot close day and even now the air came in sickening waves like a blast from the engine room of a steamer and the heat lightning played round the mountains over the harbor and showed the empty wharves and the black outlines of the steamers and the white front of the custom house and the long half circle of twinkling lamps along the quay macwilliams and langham sat panting on the lower steps of the office porch considering whether they were too lazy to clean themselves and be rowed over to the city where as it was sunday night was promised much entertainment they had been for the last hour trying to make up their minds as to this and appealing to clay to stop work and decide for them but he sat inside at a table figuring and writing under the green shade of a student's lamp and made no answer the walls of clay's office were of unplaned boards bristling with splinters and hung with blue prints and outline maps of the mine a gaudily colored portrait of madame la presidenta the noble and"
