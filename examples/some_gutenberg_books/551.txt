"1" "presently we were too indiscriminately mixed to make it safe to use our firearms and the battle resolved itself into a hand to hand struggle for possession of the deck the sole aim of each of us was to hurl one of the opposing force into the sea i shall never forget the hideous expression upon the face of the great prussian with whom chance confronted me he lowered his head and rushed at me bellowing like a bull with a quick side step and ducking low beneath his outstretched arms i eluded him and as he turned to come back at me i landed a blow upon his chin which sent him spinning toward the edge of the deck i saw his wild endeavors to regain his equilibrium i saw him reel drunkenly for an instant upon the brink of eternity and then with a loud scream slip into the sea at the same instant a pair of giant arms encircled me from behind and lifted me entirely off my feet kick and squirm as i would i could neither turn toward my antagonist nor free myself from his maniacal grasp relentlessly he was rushing me toward the side of the vessel and death there was none to stay him for each of my companions was more than occupied by from one to three of the enemy for an instant i was fearful for myself and then i saw that which filled me with a far greater terror for another my boche was bearing me toward the side of the submarine against which the tug was still pounding that i should be ground to death between the two was lost upon me as i saw the girl standing alone upon the tug's deck as i saw the stern high in air and the bow rapidly settling for the final dive as i saw death from which i could not save her clutching at the skirts of the woman i now knew all too well that i loved i had perhaps the fraction of a second longer to live when i heard an angry growl behind us mingle with a cry of pain and rage from the giant who carried me instantly he went backward to the deck and as he did so he threw his arms outwards to save himself freeing me i fell heavily upon him but was upon my feet in the instant as i arose i cast a single glance at my opponent never again would he menace me or another for nob's great jaws had closed upon his throat then i sprang toward the edge of the deck closest to the girl upon the sinking tug jump i cried jump and i held out my arms to her instantly as though with implicit confidence in my ability to save her she leaped over the side of the tug onto the sloping slippery side of the u boat i reached far over to seize her hand at the same instant the tug pointed its stern straight toward the sky and plunged out of sight my hand missed the girl's by a fraction of an inch and i saw her slip into the sea but scarce had she touched the water when i was in after her the sinking tug drew us far below the surface but i had seized her the moment i struck the water and so we went down together and together we came up a few yards from the u boat the first thing i heard was nobs barking furiously evidently he had missed me and was searching a single glance at the vessel's deck assured me that the battle was over and that we had been victorious for i saw our survivors holding a handful of the enemy at pistol points while one by one the rest of the crew was coming out of the craft's interior and lining up on deck with the other prisoners as i swam toward the submarine with the girl nobs persistent barking attracted the attention of some of the tug's crew so that as soon as we reached the side there were hands to help us aboard i asked the girl if she was hurt but she assured me that she was none the worse for this second wetting nor did she seem to suffer any from shock i was to learn for myself that this slender and seemingly delicate creature possessed the heart and courage of a warrior as we joined our own party i found the tug's mate checking up our survivors there were ten of us left not including the girl our brave skipper was missing as were eight others there had been nineteen of us in the attacking party and we had accounted in one way and another during the battle for sixteen germans and had taken nine prisoners including the commander his lieutenant had been killed not a bad day's work said bradley the mate when he had completed his roll only losing the skipper he added was the worst he was a fine man a fine man olson who in spite of his name was irish and in spite of his not being scotch had been the tug's engineer was standing with bradley and me yis he agreed it's a day's wor rk we're after doin but what are we goin to be doin wid it now we got it we'll run her into the nearest english port said bradley and then we'll all go ashore and get our v c s he concluded laughing how you goin to run her queried olson you can't trust these dutchmen bradley scratched his head i guess you're right he admitted and i don't know the first thing about a sub i do i assured him i know more about this particular sub than the officer who commanded her both men looked at me in astonishment and then i had to explain all over again as i had explained to the girl bradley and olson were delighted immediately i was put in command and the first thing i did was to go below with olson and inspect the craft thoroughly for hidden boches and damaged machinery there were no germans below and everything was intact and in ship shape working order i then ordered all hands below except one man who was to act as lookout questioning the germans i found that all except the commander were willing to resume their posts and aid in bringing the vessel into an english port i believe that they were relieved at the prospect of being detained at a comfortable english prison camp for the duration of the war after the perils and privations through which they had passed the officer however assured me that he would never be a party to the capture of his vessel there was therefore nothing to do but put the man in irons as we were preparing to put this decision into force the girl descended from the deck it was the first time that she or the german officer had seen each other's faces since we had boarded the u boat i was assisting the girl down the ladder and still retained a hold upon her arm possibly after such support was no longer necessary when she turned and looked squarely into the face of the german each voiced a sudden exclamation of surprise and dismay lys he cried and took a step toward her the girl's eyes went wide and slowly filled with a great horror as she shrank back then her slender figure stiffened to the erectness of a soldier and with chin in air and without a word she turned her back upon the officer take him away i directed the two men who guarded him and put him in irons when he had gone the girl raised her eyes to mine he is the german of whom i spoke she said he is baron von schoenvorts i merely inclined my head she had loved him i wondered if in her heart of hearts she did not love him yet immediately i became insanely jealous i hated baron friedrich von schoenvorts with such utter intensity that the emotion thrilled me with a species of exaltation but i didn't have much chance to enjoy my hatred then for almost immediately the lookout poked his face over the hatchway and bawled down that there was smoke on the horizon dead ahead immediately i went on deck to investigate and bradley came with me if she's friendly he said we'll speak her if she's not we'll sink her eh captain yes lieutenant i replied and it was his turn to smile we hoisted the union jack and remained on deck asking bradley to go below and assign to each member of the crew his duty placing one englishman with a pistol beside each german half speed ahead i commanded more rapidly now we closed the distance between ourselves and the stranger until i could plainly see the red ensign of the british merchant marine my heart swelled with pride at the thought that presently admiring british tars would be congratulating us upon our notable capture and just about then the merchant steamer must have sighted us for she veered suddenly toward the north and a moment later dense volumes of smoke issued from her funnels then steering a zigzag course she fled from us as though we had been the bubonic plague i altered the course of the submarine and set off in chase but the steamer was faster than we and soon left us hopelessly astern with a rueful smile i directed that our original course be resumed and once again we set off toward merry england that was three months ago and we haven't arrived yet nor is there any likelihood that we ever shall the steamer we had just sighted must have wirelessed a warning for it wasn't half an hour before we saw more smoke on the horizon and this time the vessel flew the white ensign of the royal navy and carried guns she didn't veer to the north or anywhere else but bore down on us rapidly i was just preparing to signal her when a flame flashed from her bows and an instant later the water in front of us was thrown high by the explosion of a shell bradley had come on deck and was standing beside me about one more of those and she'll have our range he said she doesn't seem to take much stock in our union jack a second shell passed over us and then i gave the command to change our direction at the same time directing bradley to go below and give the order to submerge i passed nobs down to him and following saw to the closing and fastening of the hatch it seemed to me that the diving tanks never had filled so slowly we heard a loud explosion apparently directly above us the craft trembled to the shock which threw us all to the deck i expected momentarily to feel the deluge of inrushing water but none came instead we continued to submerge until the manometer registered forty feet and then i knew that we were safe safe i almost smiled i had relieved olson who had remained in the tower at my direction having been a member of one of the early british submarine crews and therefore having some knowledge of the business bradley was at my side he looked at me quizzically what the devil are we to do he asked the merchantman will flee us the war vessel will destroy us neither will believe our colors or give us a chance to explain we will meet even a worse reception if we go nosing around a british port mines nets and all of it we can't do it let's try it again when this fellow has lost the scent i urged there must come a ship that will believe us and try it again we did only to be almost rammed by a huge freighter later we were fired upon by a destroyer and two merchantmen turned and fled at our approach for two days we cruised up and down the channel trying to tell some one who would listen that we were friends but no one would listen after our encounter with the first warship i had given instructions that a wireless message be sent out explaining our predicament but to my chagrin i discovered that both sending and receiving instruments had disappeared there is only one place you can go von schoenvorts sent word to me and that is kiel you can't land anywhere else in these waters if you wish i will take you there and i can promise that you will be treated well there is another place we can go i sent back my reply and we will before we'll go to germany that place is hell chapter 3 those were anxious days during which i had but little opportunity to associate with lys i had given her the commander's room bradley and i taking that of the deck officer while olson and two of our best men occupied the room ordinarily allotted to petty officers i made nobs bed down in lys room for i knew she would feel less alone nothing of much moment occurred for a while after we left british waters behind us we ran steadily along upon the surface making good time the first two boats we sighted made off as fast as they could go and the third a huge freighter fired on us forcing us to submerge it was after this that our troubles commenced one of the diesel engines broke down in the morning and while we were working on it the forward port diving tank commenced to fill i was on deck at the time and noted the gradual list guessing at once what was happening i leaped for the hatch and slamming it closed above my head dropped to the centrale by this time the craft was going down by the head with a most unpleasant list to port and i didn't wait to transmit orders to some one else but ran as fast as i could for the valve that let the sea into the forward port diving tank it was wide open to close it and to have the pump started that would empty it were the work of but a minute but we had had a close call i knew that the valve had never opened itself some one had opened it some one who was willing to die himself if he might at the same time encompass the death of all of us after that i kept a guard pacing the length of the narrow craft we worked upon the engine all that day and night and half the following day most of the time we drifted idly upon the surface but toward noon we sighted smoke due west and having found that only enemies inhabited the world for us i ordered that the other engine be started so that we could move out of the path of the oncoming steamer the moment the engine started to turn however there was a grinding sound of tortured steel and when it had been stopped we found that some one had placed a cold chisel in one of the gears it was another two days before we were ready to limp along half repaired the night before the repairs were completed the sentry came to my room and awoke me he was rather an intelligent fellow of the english middle class in whom i had much confidence well wilson i asked what's the matter now he raised his finger to his lips and came closer to me i think i've found out who's doin the mischief he whispered and nodded his head toward the girl's room i seen her sneakin from the crew's room just now he went on she'd been in gassin wit the boche commander benson seen her in there las night too but he never said nothin till i goes on watch tonight benson's sorter slow in the head an he never puts two an two together till some one else has made four out of it if the man had come in and struck me suddenly in the face i could have been no more surprised say nothing of this to anyone i ordered keep your eyes and ears open and report every suspicious thing you see or hear the man saluted and left me but for an hour or more i tossed restless upon my hard bunk in an agony of jealousy and fear finally i fell into a troubled sleep it was daylight when i awoke we were steaming along slowly upon the surface my orders having been to proceed at half speed until we could take an observation and determine our position the sky had been overcast all the previous day and all night but as i stepped into the centrale that morning i was delighted to see that the sun was again shining the spirits of the men seemed improved everything seemed propitious i forgot at once the cruel misgivings of the past night as i set to work to take my observations what a blow awaited me the sextant and chronometer had both been broken beyond repair and they had been broken just this very night they had been broken upon the night that lys had been seen talking with von schoenvorts i think that it was this last thought which hurt me the worst i could look the other disaster in the face with equanimity but the bald fact that lys might be a traitor appalled me i called bradley and olson on deck and told them what had happened but for the life of me i couldn't bring myself to repeat what wilson had reported to me the previous night in fact as i had given the matter thought it seemed incredible that the girl could have passed through my room in which bradley and i slept and then carried on a conversation in the crew's room in which von schoenvorts was kept without having been seen by more than a single man bradley shook his head i can't make it out he said one of those boches must be pretty clever to come it over us all like this but they haven't harmed us as much as they think there are still the extra instruments it was my turn now to shake a doleful head there are no extra instruments i told them they too have disappeared as did the wireless apparatus both men looked at me in amazement we still have the compass and the sun said olson they may be after getting the compass some night but they's too many of us around in the daytime fer em to get the sun it was then that one of the men stuck his head up through the hatchway and seeing me asked permission to come on deck and get a breath of fresh air i recognized him as benson the man who wilson had said reported having seen lys with von schoenvorts two nights before i motioned him on deck and then called him to one side asking if he had seen anything out of the way or unusual during his trick on watch the night before the fellow scratched his head a moment and said no and then as though it was an afterthought he told me that he had seen the girl in the crew's room about midnight talking with the german commander but as there hadn't seemed to him to be any harm in that he hadn't said anything about it telling him never to fail to report to me anything in the slightest out of the ordinary routine of the ship i dismissed him several of the other men now asked permission to come on deck and soon all but those actually engaged in some necessary duty were standing around smoking and talking all in the best of spirits i took advantage of the absence of the men upon the deck to go below for my breakfast which the cook was already preparing upon the electric stove lys followed by nobs appeared as i entered the centrale she met me with a pleasant good morning which i am afraid i replied to in a tone that was rather constrained and surly will you breakfast with me i suddenly asked the girl determined to commence a probe of my own along the lines which duty demanded she nodded a sweet acceptance of my invitation and together we sat down at the little table of the officers mess you slept well last night i asked all night she replied i am a splendid sleeper her manner was so straightforward and honest that i could not bring myself to believe in her duplicity yet thinking to surprise her into a betrayal of her guilt i blurted out the chronometer and sextant were both destroyed last night there is a traitor among us but she never turned a hair by way of evidencing guilty knowledge of the catastrophe who could it have been she cried the germans would be crazy to do it for their lives are as much at stake as ours men are often glad to die for an ideal an ideal of patriotism perhaps i replied and a willingness to martyr themselves includes a willingness to sacrifice others even those who love them women are much the same except that they will go even further than most men they will sacrifice everything even honor for love i watched her face carefully as i spoke and i thought that i detected a very faint flush mounting her cheek seeing an opening and an advantage i sought to follow it up take von schoenvorts for instance i continued he would doubtless be glad to die and take us all with him could he prevent in no other way the falling of his vessel into enemy hands he would sacrifice anyone even you and if you still love him you might be his ready tool do you understand me she looked at me in wide eyed consternation for a moment and then she went very white and rose from her seat i do she replied and turning her back upon me she walked quickly toward her room i started to follow for even believing what i did i was sorry that i had hurt her i reached the door to the crew's room just behind her and in time to see von schoenvorts lean forward and whisper something to her as she passed but she must have guessed that she might be watched for she passed on that afternoon it clouded over the wind mounted to a gale and the sea rose until the craft was wallowing and rolling frightfully nearly everyone aboard was sick the air became foul and oppressive for twenty four hours i did not leave my post in the conning tower as both olson and bradley were sick finally i found that i must get a little rest and so i looked about for some one to relieve me benson volunteered he had not been sick and assured me that he was a former r.n man and had been detailed for submarine duty for over two years i was glad that it was he for i had considerable confidence in his loyalty and so it was with a feeling of security that i went below and lay down i slept twelve hours straight and when i awoke and discovered what i had done i lost no time in getting to the conning tower there sat benson as wide awake as could be and the compass showed that we were heading straight into the west the storm was still raging nor did it abate its fury until the fourth day we were all pretty well done up and looked forward to the time when we could go on deck and fill our lungs with fresh air during the whole four days i had not seen the girl as she evidently kept closely to her room and during this time no untoward incident had occurred aboard the boat a fact which seemed to strengthen the web of circumstantial evidence about her for six more days after the storm lessened we still had fairly rough weather nor did the sun once show himself during all that time for the season it was now the middle of june the storm was unusual but being from southern california i was accustomed to unusual weather in fact i have discovered that the world over unusual weather prevails at all times of the year we kept steadily to our westward course and as the u 33 was one of the fastest submersibles we had ever turned out i knew that we must be pretty close to the north american coast what puzzled me most was the fact that for six days we had not sighted a single ship it seemed remarkable that we could cross the atlantic almost to the coast of the american continent without glimpsing smoke or sail and at last i came to the conclusion that we were way off our course but whether to the north or to the south of it i could not determine on the seventh day the sea lay comparatively calm at early dawn there was a slight haze upon the ocean which had cut off our view of the stars but conditions all pointed toward a clear morrow and i was on deck anxiously awaiting the rising of the sun my eyes were glued upon the impenetrable mist astern for there in the east i should see the first glow of the rising sun that would assure me we were still upon the right course gradually the heavens lightened but astern i could see no intenser glow that would indicate the rising sun behind the mist bradley was standing at my side presently he touched my arm look captain he said and pointed south i looked and gasped for there directly to port i saw outlined through the haze the red top of the rising sun hurrying to the tower i looked at the compass it showed that we were holding steadily upon our westward course either the sun was rising in the south or the compass had been tampered with the conclusion was obvious i went back to bradley and told him what i had discovered and i concluded we can't make another five hundred knots without oil our provisions are running low and so is our water god only knows how far south we have run there is nothing to do he replied other than to alter our course once more toward the west we must raise land soon or we shall all be lost i told him to do so and then i set to work improvising a crude sextant with which we finally took our bearings in a rough and most unsatisfactory manner for when the work was done we did not know how far from the truth the result might be it showed us to be about 20 north and 30 west nearly twenty five hundred miles off our course in short if our reading was anywhere near correct we must have been traveling due south for six days bradley now relieved benson for we had arranged our shifts so that the latter and olson now divided the nights while bradley and i alternated with one another during the days i questioned both olson and benson closely in the matter of the compass but each stoutly maintained that no one had tampered with it during his tour of duty benson gave me a knowing smile as much as to say well you and i know who did this yet i could not believe that it was the girl we kept to our westerly course for several hours when the lookout's cry announced a sail i ordered the u 33 s course altered and we bore down upon the stranger for i had come to a decision which was the result of necessity we could not lie there in the middle of the atlantic and starve to death if there was any way out of it the sailing ship saw us while we were still a long way off as was evidenced by her efforts to escape there was scarcely any wind however and her case was hopeless so when we drew near and signaled her to stop she came into the wind and lay there with her sails flapping idly we moved in quite close to her she was the balmen of halmstad sweden with a general cargo from brazil for spain i explained our circumstances to her skipper and asked for food water and oil but when he found that we were not german he became very angry and abusive and started to draw away from us but i was in no mood for any such business turning toward bradley who was in the conning tower i snapped out gun service on deck to the diving stations we had no opportunity for drill but every man had been posted as to his duties and the german members of the crew understood that it was obedience or death for them as each was accompanied by a man with a pistol most of them though were only too glad to obey me bradley passed the order down into the ship and a moment later the gun crew clambered up the"
