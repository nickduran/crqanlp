"1" "believe that i am the mad king leopold you are the king she said in a convincing manner you are a very brave young lady he said earnestly if all the mad king's subjects were as loyal as you and as brave he would not have languished for ten years behind the walls of blentz i am a von der tann she said proudly as though that was explanation sufficient to account for any bravery or loyalty even a von der tann might without dishonor hesitate to accompany a mad man through the woods he replied especially if she happened to be a very a very he halted flushing a very what your majesty asked the girl a very young woman he ended lamely emma von der tann knew that he had not intended saying that at all being a woman she knew precisely what he had meant to say and she discovered that she would very much have liked to hear him say it suppose said barney that peter's soldiers run across us what then they will take you back to blentz your majesty and you i do not think that they will dare lay hands on me though it is possible that peter might do so he hates my father even more now than he did when the old king lived i wish said mr custer that i had gone down after my guns why didn't you tell me in the first place that i was a king and that i might get you in trouble if you were found with me why they may even take me for an emperor or a mikado who knows and then look at all the trouble we'd be in which was barney's way of humoring a maniac and they might even shave off your beautiful beard which was the girl's way do you think that you would like me better in the green wastebasket hat with the red roses asked barney a very sad look came into the girl's eyes it was pitiful to think that this big handsome young man for whose return to the throne all lutha had prayed for ten long years was only a silly half wit what might he not have accomplished for his people had this terrible misfortune not overtaken him in every other way he seemed fitted to be the savior of his country if she could but make him remember your majesty she said do you not recall the time that your father came upon a state visit to my father's castle you were a little boy then he brought you with him i was a little girl and we played together you would not let me call you highness but insisted that i should always call you leopold when i forgot you would accuse me of lese majeste and sentence me to to punishment what was the punishment asked barney noticing her hesitation and wishing to encourage her in the pretty turn her dementia had taken again the girl hesitated she hated to say it but if it would help to recall the past to that poor dimmed mind it was her duty every time i called you highness you made me give you a a kiss she almost whispered i hope said barney that you will be guilty of lese majeste often we were little children then your majesty the girl reminded him had he thought her of sound mind mr custer might have taken advantage of his royal prerogatives on the spot for the girl's lips were most tempting but when he remembered the poor weak mind tears almost came to his eyes and there sprang to his heart a great desire to protect and guard this unfortunate child and when i was crown prince what were you way back there in the beautiful days of our childhood asked barney why i was what i still am your majesty replied the girl princess emma von der tann so the poor child besides thinking him a king thought herself a princess she certainly was mad well he would humor her then i should call you your highness shouldn't i he asked you always called me emma when we were children very well then you shall be emma and i leopold is it a bargain the king's will is law she said they had come to a very steep hillside up which the half obliterated trail zigzagged toward the crest of a flat topped hill barney went ahead taking the girl's hand in his to help her and thus they came to the top to stand hand in hand breathing heavily after the stiff climb the girl's hair had come loose about her temples and a lock was blowing over her face her cheeks were very red and her eyes bright barney thought he had never looked upon a lovelier picture he smiled down into her eyes and she smiled back at him i wished back there a way he said that that little brook had been as wide as the ocean now i wish that this little hill had been as high as mont blanc you like to climb she asked i should like to climb forever with you he said seriously she looked up at him quickly a reply was on her lips but she never uttered it for at that moment a ruffian in picturesque rags leaped out from behind a near by bush confronting them with leveled revolver he was so close that the muzzle of the weapon almost touched barney's face in that the fellow made his mistake you see said barney unexcitedly that i was right about the brigands after all what do you want my man the man's eyes had suddenly gone wide he stared with open mouth at the young fellow before him then a cunning look came into his eyes i want you your majesty he said godfrey exclaimed barney did the whole bunch escape quick growled the man hold up your hands the notice made it plain that you would be worth as much dead as alive and i have no mind to lose you so do not tempt me to kill you barney's hands went up but not in the way that the brigand had expected instead one of them seized his weapon and shoved it aside while with the other custer planted a blow between his eyes and sent him reeling backward the two men closed fighting for possession of the gun in the scrimmage it was exploded but a moment later the american succeeded in wresting it from his adversary and hurled it into the ravine striking at one another the two surged backward and forward at the very edge of the hill each searching for the other's throat the girl stood by watching the battle with wide frightened eyes if she could only do something to aid the king she saw a loose stone lying at a little distance from the fighters and hastened to procure it if she could strike the brigand a single good blow on the side of the head leopold might easily overpower him when she had gathered up the rock and turned back toward the two she saw that the man she thought to be the king was not much in the way of needing outside assistance she could not but marvel at the strength and dexterity of this poor fellow who had spent almost half his life penned within the four walls of a prison it must be she thought the superhuman strength with which maniacs are always credited nevertheless she hurried toward them with her weapon but just before she reached them the brigand made a last mad effort to free himself from the fingers that had found his throat he lunged backward dragging the other with him his foot struck upon the root of a tree and together the two toppled over into the ravine as the girl hastened toward the spot where the two had disappeared she was startled to see three troopers of the palace cavalry headed by an officer break through the trees at a short distance from where the battle had waged the four men ran rapidly toward her what has happened here shouted the officer to emma von der tann and then as he came closer gott can it be possible that it is your highness the girl paid no attention to the officer instead she hurried down the steep embankment toward the underbrush into which the two men had fallen there was no sound from below and no movement in the bushes to indicate that a moment before two desperately battling human beings had dropped among them the soldiers were close upon the girl's heels but it was she who first reached the two quiet figures that lay side by side upon the stony ground halfway down the hillside when the officer stopped beside her she was sitting on the ground holding the head of one of the combatants in her lap a little stream of blood trickled from a wound in the forehead the officer stooped closer he is dead he asked the king is dead replied the princess emma von der tann a little sob in her voice the king exclaimed the officer and then as he bent lower over the white face leopold the girl nodded we were searching for him said the officer when we heard the shot then arising he removed his cap saying in a very low voice the king is dead long live the king iii an angry king the soldiers stood behind their officer none of them had ever seen leopold of lutha he had been but a name to them they cared nothing for him but in the presence of death they were awed by the majesty of the king they had never known the hands of emma von der tann were chafing the wrists of the man whose head rested in her lap leopold she whispered leopold come back mad king you may have been but still you were king of lutha my father's king my king the girl nearly cried out in shocked astonishment as she saw the eyes of the dead king open but emma von der tann was quick witted she knew for what purpose the soldiers from the palace were scouring the country had she not thought the king dead she would have cut out her tongue rather than reveal his identity to these soldiers of his great enemy now she saw that leopold lived and she must undo the harm she had innocently wrought she bent lower over barney's face trying to hide it from the soldiers go away please she called to them leave me with my dead king you are peter's men you do not care for leopold living or dead go back to your new king and tell him that this poor young man can never more stand between him and the throne the officer hesitated we shall have to take the king's body with us your highness he said the officer evidently becoming suspicious came closer and as he did so barney custer sat up go away cried the girl for she saw that the king was attempting to speak my father's people will carry leopold of lutha in state to the capital of his kingdom what's all this row about he asked can't you let a dead king alone if the young lady asks you to what kind of a short sport are you anyway run along now and tie yourself outside the officer smiled a trifle maliciously perhaps ah he said i am very glad indeed that you are not dead your majesty barney custer turned his incredulous eyes upon the lieutenant et tu brute he cried in anguished accents letting his head fall back into the girl's lap he found it very comfortable there indeed the officer smiled and shook his head then he tapped his forehead meaningly i did not know he said to the girl that he was so bad but come it is some distance to blentz and the afternoon is already well spent your highness will accompany us i cried the girl you certainly cannot be serious and why not your highness asked the officer we had strict orders to arrest not only the king but any companions who may have been involved in his escape i had nothing whatever to do with his escape said the girl though i should have been only too glad to have aided him had the opportunity presented king peter may think differently replied the man the regent you mean the girl corrected him haughtily the officer shrugged his shoulders regent or king he is ruler of lutha nevertheless and he would take away my commission were i to tell him that i had found a von der tann in company with the king and had permitted her to escape your blood convicts your highness you are going to take me to blentz and confine me there asked the girl in a very small voice and with wide incredulous eyes you would not dare thus to humiliate a von der tann i am very sorry said the officer but i am a soldier and soldiers must obey their superiors my orders are strict you may be thankful he added that it was not maenck who discovered you at the mention of the name the girl shuddered in so far as it is in my power your highness and his majesty will be accorded every consideration of dignity and courtesy while under my escort you need not entertain any fear of me he concluded barney custer during this to him remarkable dialogue had risen to his feet and assisted the girl in rising now he turned and spoke to the officer this farce he said has gone quite far enough if it is a joke it is becoming a very sorry one i am not a king i am an american bernard custer of beatrice nebraska u.s.a look at me look at me closely do i look like a king every inch your majesty replied the officer barney looked at the man aghast well i am not a king he said at last and if you go to arresting me and throwing me into one of your musty old dungeons you will find that i am a whole lot more important than most kings i'm an american citizen yes your majesty replied the officer a trifle impatiently but we waste time in idle discussion will your majesty be so good as to accompany me without resistance if you will first escort this young lady to a place of safety replied barney she will be quite safe at blentz said the lieutenant barney turned to look at the girl a question in his eyes before them stood the soldiers with drawn revolvers and now at the summit of the hill a dozen more appeared in command of a sergeant they were two against nearly a score and barney custer was unarmed the girl shook her head there is no alternative i am afraid your majesty she said barney wheeled toward the officer very well lieutenant he said we will accompany you the party turned back up the hillside leaving the dead bandit where he lay the fellow's neck had been broken by the fall a short distance from where the man had confronted them the two prisoners were brought to the main road where they saw still other troopers and with them the horses of those who had gone into the forest on foot barney and the girl were mounted on two of the animals the soldiers who had ridden them clambering up behind two of their comrades a moment later the troop set out along the road which leads to blentz the prisoners rode near the center of the column surrounded by troopers for a time they were both silent barney was wondering if he had accidentally tumbled into the private grounds of lutha's largest madhouse or if in reality these people mistook him for the young king it seemed incredible it had commenced slowly to dawn upon him that perhaps the girl was not crazy after all had not the officer addressed her as your highness now that he thought upon it he recalled that she did have quite a haughty and regal way with her at times especially so when she had addressed the officer of course she might be mad after all and possibly the bandit too but it seemed unbelievable that the officer was mad and his entire troop of cavalry should be composed of maniacs yet they all persisted in speaking and acting as though he were indeed the mad king of lutha and the young girl at his side a princess from pitying the girl he had come to feel a little bit in awe of her to the best of his knowledge he had never before associated with a real princess when he recalled that he had treated her as he would an ordinary mortal and that he had thought her demented and had tried to humor her mad whims he felt very foolish indeed presently he turned a sheepish glance in her direction to find her looking at him he saw her flush slightly as his eyes met hers can your highness ever forgive me he asked forgive you she cried in astonishment for what your majesty for thinking you insane and for getting you into this horrible predicament he replied but especially for thinking you insane did you think me mad she asked in wide eyed astonishment when you insisted that i was a king yes he replied but now i begin to believe that it must be i who am mad after all or else i bear a remarkable resemblance to leopold of lutha you do your majesty replied the girl barney saw it was useless to attempt to convince them and so he decided to give up for the time have me king if you will he said but please do not call me your majesty any more it gets on my nerves your will is law leopold replied the girl hesitating prettily before the familiar name but do not forget your part of the compact he smiled at her a princess wasn't half so terrible after all and your will shall be my law emma he said it was almost dark when they came to blentz the castle lay far up on the side of a steep hill above the town it was an ancient pile but had been maintained in an excellent state of repair as barney custer looked up at the grim towers and mighty buttressed walls his heart sank it had taken the mad king ten years to make his escape from that gloomy and forbidding pile poor child he murmured thinking of the girl before the barbican the party was halted by the guard an officer with a lantern stepped out upon the lowered portcullis the lieutenant who had captured them rode forward to meet him a detachment of the royal horse guards escorting his majesty the king who is returning to blentz he said in reply to the officer's sharp challenge the king exclaimed the officer you have found him and he advanced with raised lantern searching for the monarch at last whispered barney to the girl at his side i shall be vindicated this man at least who is stationed at blentz must know his king by sight the officer came quite close holding his lantern until the rays fell full in barney's face he scrutinized the young man for a moment there was neither humility nor respect in his manner so that the american was sure that the fellow had discovered the imposture from the bottom of his heart he hoped so then the officer swung the lantern until its light shone upon the girl and who's the wench with him he asked the officer who had found them the man was standing close beside barney's horse and the words were scarce out of his month when the american slipped from his saddle to the portcullis and struck the officer full in the face she is the princess von der tann you boor said barney and let that help you remember it in future the officer scrambled to his feet white with rage whipping out his sword he rushed at barney you shall die for that you half wit he cried lieutenant butzow he of the royal horse rushed forward to prevent the assault and emma von der tann sprang from her saddle and threw herself in front of barney butzow grasped the other officer's arm are you mad schonau he cried would you kill the king the fellow tugged to escape the grasp of butzow he was crazed with anger why not he bellowed you were a fool not to have done it yourself maenck will do it and get a baronetcy it will mean a captaincy for me at least let me at him no man can strike karl schonau and live the king is unarmed cried emma von der tann would you murder him in cold blood he shall not murder him at all your highness said lieutenant butzow quietly give me your sword lieutenant schonau i place you under arrest what you have just said will not please the regent when it is reported to him you should keep your head better when you are angry it is the truth growled schonau regretting that his anger had led him into a disclosure of the plot against the king's life but like most weak characters fearing to admit himself in error even more than he feared the consequences of his rash words do you intend taking my sword asked schonau suddenly turning toward lieutenant butzow standing beside him we will forget the whole occurrence lieutenant replied butzow if you will promise not to harm his majesty or offer him or the princess von der tann further humiliation their position is sufficiently unpleasant without our adding to the degradation of it very well grumbled schonau pass on into the courtyard barney and the girl remounted and the little cavalcade moved forward through the ballium and the great gate into the court beyond did you notice said barney to the princess that even he believes me to be the king i cannot fathom it within the castle they were met by a number of servants and soldiers an officer escorted them to the great hall and presently a dark visaged captain of cavalry entered and approached them butzow saluted his majesty the king he announced has returned to blentz in accordance with the commands of the regent i deliver his august person into your safe keeping captain maenck maenck nodded he was looking at barney with evident curiosity where did you find him he asked butzow he made no pretense of according to barney the faintest indication of the respect that is supposed to be due to those of royal blood barney commenced to hope that he had finally come upon one who would know that he was not king butzow recounted the details of the finding of the king as he spoke maenck's eyes restless and furtive seemed to be appraising the personal charms of the girl who stood just back of barney the american did not like the appearance of the officer but he saw that he was evidently supreme at blentz and he determined to appeal to him in the hope that the man might believe his story and untangle the ridiculous muddle that a chance resemblance to a fugitive monarch had thrown him and the girl into captain said barney stepping closer to the officer there has been a mistake in identity here i am not the king i am an american traveling for pleasure in lutha the fact that i have gray eyes and wear a full reddish brown beard is my only offense you are doubtless familiar with the king's appearance and so you at least have already seen that i am not his majesty not being the king there is no cause to detain me longer and as i am not a fugitive and never have been this young lady has been guilty of no misdemeanor or crime in being in my company therefore she too should be released in the name of justice and common decency i am sure that you will liberate us both at once and furnish the princess von der tann at least with a proper escort to her home maenck listened in silence until barney had finished a half smile upon his thick lips i am commencing to believe that you are not so crazy as we have all thought he said certainly and he let his eyes rest upon emma von der tann you are not mentally deficient in so far as your judgment of a good looking woman is concerned i could not have made a better selection myself as for my familiarity with your appearance you know as well as i that i have never seen you before but that is not necessary you conform perfectly to the printed description of you with which the kingdom is flooded were that not enough the fact that you were discovered with old von der tann's daughter is sufficient to remove the least doubt as to your identity you are governor of blentz cried barney and yet you say that you have never seen the king certainly replied maenck after you escaped the entire personnel of the garrison here was changed even the old servants to a man were withdrawn and others substituted you will have difficulty in again escaping for those who aided you before are no longer here there is no man in the castle of blentz who has ever seen the king asked barney none who has seen him before tonight replied maenck but were we in doubt we have the word of the princess emma that you are leopold did she not admit it to you butzow when she thought his majesty dead she admitted it replied butzow we gain nothing by discussing the matter said maenck shortly you are leopold of lutha prince peter says that you are mad all that concerns me is that you do not escape again and you may rest assured that while ernst maenck is governor of blentz you shall not escape and go at large again are the royal apartments in readiness for his majesty dr stein he concluded turning toward a rat faced little man with bushy whiskers who stood just behind him the query was propounded in an ironical tone and with a manner that made no pretense of concealing the contempt of the speaker for the man he thought the king the eyes of the princess emma were blazing as she caught the scant respect in maenck's manner she looked quickly toward barney to see if he intended rebuking the man for his impertinence she saw that the king evidently intended overlooking maenck's attitude but emma von der tann was of a different mind she had seen maenck several times at social functions in the capital he had even tried to win a place in her favor but she had always disliked him even before the nasty stories of his past life had become common gossip and within the year she had won his hatred by definitely indicating to him that he was persona non grata in so far as she was concerned now she turned upon him her eyes flashing with indignation do you forget sir that you address the king she cried that you are without honor i have heard men say and i may truly believe it now that i have seen what manner of man you are the most lowly bred boor in all lutha would not be so ungenerous as to take advantage of his king's helplessness to heap indignities upon him leopold of lutha shall come into his own some day and my dearest hope is that his first act may be to mete out to such as you the punishment you deserve maenck paled in anger his fingers twitched nervously but he controlled his temper remarkably well biding his time for revenge take the king to his apartments stein he commanded curtly and you lieutenant butzow accompany them with a guard nor leave until you see that he is safely confined you may return here afterward for my further instructions in the meantime i wish to examine the king's mistress for a moment tense silence reigned in the apartment after maenck had delivered his wanton insult emma von der tann her little chin high in the air stood straight and haughty nor was there any sign in her expression to indicate that she had heard the man's words barney was the first to take cognizance of them you cur he cried and took a step toward maenck you're going to eat that word for word maenck stepped back his hand upon his sword butzow laid a hand upon barney's arm don't your majesty he implored it will but make your position more unpleasant nor will it add to the safety of the princess von der tann for you to strike him now barney shook himself free from butzow and before either stein or the lieutenant could prevent had sprung upon maenck the latter had not been quick enough with his sword so that barney had struck him twice heavily in the face before the officer was able to draw butzow had sprung to the king's side and was attempting to interpose"
