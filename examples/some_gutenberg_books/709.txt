"1" "a spinning wheel he knew it at once because his mother's spinning wheel had been his governess long ago and still taught him things it was the spinning wheel that first taught him to make verses and to sing and to think whether all was right inside him or at least it had helped him in all these things hence it was no wonder he should know a spinning wheel when he heard it sing even although as the bird of paradise to other birds was the song of that wheel to the song of his mother's he stood listening so entranced that he forgot to knock and the wheel went on and on spinning in his brain songs and tales and rhymes till he was almost asleep as well as dreaming for sleep does not always come first but suddenly came the thought of the poor bird which had been lying motionless in his hand all the time and that woke him up and at once he knocked come in curdie said a voice curdie shook it was getting rather awful the heart that had never much heeded an army of goblins trembled at the soft word of invitation but then there was the red spotted white thing in his hand he dared not hesitate though gently he opened the door through which the sound came and what did he see nothing at first except indeed a great sloping shaft of moonlight that came in at a high window and rested on the floor he stood and stared at it forgetting to shut the door why don't you come in curdie said the voice did you never see moonlight before never without a moon answered curdie in a trembling tone but gathering courage certainly not returned the voice which was thin and quavering i never saw moonlight without a moon but there's no moon outside said curdie ah but you're inside now said the voice the answer did not satisfy curdie but the voice went on there are more moons than you know of curdie where there is one sun there are many moons and of many sorts come in and look out of my window and you will soon satisfy yourself that there is a moon looking in at it the gentleness of the voice made curdie remember his manners he shut the door and drew a step or two nearer to the moonlight all the time the sound of the spinning had been going on and on and curdie now caught sight of the wheel oh it was such a thin delicate thing reminding him of a spider's web in a hedge it stood in the middle of the moonlight and it seemed as if the moonlight had nearly melted it away a step nearer he saw with a start two little hands at work with it and then at last in the shadow on the other side of the moonlight which came like silver between he saw the form to which the hands belonged a small withered creature so old that no age would have seemed too great to write under her picture seated on a stool beyond the spinning wheel which looked very large beside her but as i said very thin like a long legged spider holding up its own web which was the round wheel itself she sat crumpled together a filmy thing that it seemed a puff would blow away more like the body of a fly the big spider had sucked empty and left hanging in his web than anything else i can think of when curdie saw her he stood still again a good deal in wonder a very little in reverence a little in doubt and i must add a little in amusement at the odd look of the old marvel her grey hair mixed with the moonlight so that he could not tell where the one began and the other ended her crooked back bent forward over her chest her shoulders nearly swallowed up her head between them and her two little hands were just like the grey claws of a hen scratching at the thread which to curdie was of course invisible across the moonlight indeed curdie laughed within himself just a little at the sight and when he thought of how the princess used to talk about her huge great old grandmother he laughed more but that moment the little lady leaned forward into the moonlight and curdie caught a glimpse of her eyes and all the laugh went out of him what do you come here for curdie she said as gently as before then curdie remembered that he stood there as a culprit and worst of all as one who had his confession yet to make there was no time to hesitate over it oh ma'am see here he said and advanced a step or two holding out the pigeon what have you got there she asked again curdie advanced a few steps and held out his hand with the pigeon that she might see what it was into the moonlight the moment the rays fell upon it the pigeon gave a faint flutter the old lady put out her old hands and took it and held it to her bosom and rocked it murmuring over it as if it were a sick baby when curdie saw how distressed she was he grew sorrier still and said i didn't mean to do any harm ma'am i didn't think of its being yours ah curdie if it weren't mine what would become of it now she returned you say you didn't mean any harm did you mean any good curdie no answered curdie remember then that whoever does not mean good is always in danger of harm but i try to give everybody fair play and those that are in the wrong are in far more need of it always than those who are in the right they can afford to do without it therefore i say for you that when you shot that arrow you did not know what a pigeon is now that you do know you are sorry it is very dangerous to do things you don't know about but please ma'am i don't mean to be rude or to contradict you said curdie but if a body was never to do anything but what he knew to be good he would have to live half his time doing nothing there you are much mistaken said the old quavering voice how little you must have thought why you don't seem even to know the good of the things you are constantly doing now don't mistake me i don't mean you are good for doing them it is a good thing to eat your breakfast but you don't fancy it's very good of you to do it the thing is good not you curdie laughed there are a great many more good things than bad things to do now tell me what bad thing you have done today besides this sore hurt to my little white friend while she talked curdie had sunk into a sort of reverie in which he hardly knew whether it was the old lady or his own heart that spoke and when she asked him that question he was at first much inclined to consider himself a very good fellow on the whole i really don't think i did anything else that was very bad all day he said to himself but at the same time he could not honestly feel that he was worth standing up for all at once a light seemed to break in upon his mind and he woke up and there was the withered little atomy of the old lady on the other side of the moonlight and there was the spinning wheel singing on and on in the middle of it i know now ma'am i understand now he said thank you ma'am for spinning it into me with your wheel i see now that i have been doing wrong the whole day and such a many days besides indeed i don't know when i ever did right and yet it seems as if i had done right some time and had forgotten how when i killed your bird i did not know i was doing wrong just because i was always doing wrong and the wrong had soaked all through me what wrong were you doing all day curdie it is better to come to the point you know said the old lady and her voice was gentler even than before i was doing the wrong of never wanting or trying to be better and now i see that i have been letting things go as they would for a long time whatever came into my head i did and whatever didn't come into my head i didn't do i never sent anything away and never looked out for anything to come i haven't been attending to my mother or my father either and now i think of it i know i have often seen them looking troubled and i have never asked them what was the matter and now i see too that i did not ask because i suspected it had something to do with me and my behaviour and didn't want to hear the truth and i know i have been grumbling at my work and doing a hundred other things that are wrong you have got it curdie said the old lady in a voice that sounded almost as if she had been crying when people don't care to be better they must be doing everything wrong i am so glad you shot my bird ma'am exclaimed curdie how can you be because it has brought you to see what sort you were when you did it and what sort you will grow to be again only worse if you don't mind now that you are sorry my poor bird will be better look up my dovey the pigeon gave a flutter and spread out one of its red spotted wings across the old woman's bosom i will mend the little angel she said and in a week or two it will be flying again so you may ease your heart about the pigeon oh thank you thank you cried curdie i don't know how to thank you then i will tell you there is only one way i care for do better and grow better and be better and never kill anything without a good reason for it ma'am i will go and fetch my bow and arrows and you shall burn them yourself i have no fire that would burn your bow and arrows curdie then i promise you to burn them all under my mother's porridge pot tomorrow morning no no curdie keep them and practice with them every day and grow a good shot there are plenty of bad things that want killing and a day will come when they will prove useful but i must see first whether you will do as i tell you that i will said curdie what is it ma'am only something not to do answered the old lady if you should hear anyone speak about me never to laugh or make fun of me oh ma'am exclaimed curdie shocked that she should think such a request needful stop stop she went on people hereabout sometimes tell very odd and in fact ridiculous stories of an old woman who watches what is going on and occasionally interferes they mean me though what they say is often great nonsense now what i want of you is not to laugh or side with them in any way because they will take that to mean that you don't believe there is any such person a bit more than they do now that would not be the case would it curdie no indeed ma'am i've seen you the old woman smiled very oddly yes you've seen me she said but mind she continued i don't want you to say anything only to hold your tongue and not seem to side with them that will be easy said curdie now that i've seen you with my very own eyes ma'am not so easy as you think perhaps said the old lady with another curious smile i want to be your friend she added after a little pause but i don't quite know yet whether you will let me indeed i will ma'am said curdie that is for me to find out she rejoined with yet another strange smile in the meantime all i can say is come to me again when you find yourself in any trouble and i will see what i can do for you only the canning depends on yourself i am greatly pleased with you for bringing me my pigeon doing your best to set right what you had set wrong as she spoke she held out her hand to him and when he took it she made use of his to help herself up from her stool and when or how it came about curdie could not tell the same instant she stood before him a tall strong woman plainly very old but as grand as she was old and only rather severe looking every trace of the decrepitude and witheredness she showed as she hovered like a film about her wheel had vanished her hair was very white but it hung about her head in great plenty and shone like silver in the moonlight straight as a pillar she stood before the astonished boy and the wounded bird had now spread out both its wings across her bosom like some great mystical ornament of frosted silver oh now i can never forget you cried curdie i see now what you really are did i not tell you the truth when i sat at my wheel said the old lady yes ma'am answered curdie i can do no more than tell you the truth now she rejoined it is a bad thing indeed to forget one who has told us the truth now go curdie obeyed and took a few steps toward the door please ma'am what am i to call you he was going to say but when he turned to speak he saw nobody whether she was there or not he could not tell however for the moonlight had vanished and the room was utterly dark a great fear such as he had never before known came upon him and almost overwhelmed him he groped his way to the door and crawled down the stair in doubt and anxiety as to how he should find his way out of the house in the dark and the stair seemed ever so much longer than when he came up nor was that any wonder for down and down he went until at length his foot struck a door and when he rose and opened it he found himself under the starry moonless sky at the foot of the tower he soon discovered the way out of the garden with which he had some acquaintance already and in a few minutes was climbing the mountain with a solemn and cheerful heart it was rather dark but he knew the way well as he passed the rock from which the poor pigeon fell wounded with his arrow a great joy filled his heart at the thought that he was delivered from the blood of the little bird and he ran the next hundred yards at full speed up the hill some dark shadows passed him he did not even care to think what they were but let them run when he reached home he found his father and mother waiting supper for him chapter 4 curdie's father and mother the eyes of the fathers and mothers are quick to read their children's looks and when curdie entered the cottage his parents saw at once that something unusual had taken place when he said to his mother i beg your pardon for being so late there was something in the tone beyond the politeness that went to her heart for it seemed to come from the place where all lovely things were born before they began to grow in this world when he set his father's chair to the table an attention he had not shown him for a long time peter thanked him with more gratitude than the boy had ever yet felt in all his life it was a small thing to do for the man who had been serving him since ever he was born but i suspect there is nothing a man can be so grateful for as that to which he has the most right there was a change upon curdie and father and mother felt there must be something to account for it and therefore were pretty sure he had something to tell them for when a child's heart is all right it is not likely he will want to keep anything from his parents but the story of the evening was too solemn for curdie to come out with all at once he must wait until they had had their porridge and the affairs of this world were over for the day but when they were seated on the grassy bank of the brook that went so sweetly blundering over the great stones of its rocky channel for the whole meadow lay on the top of a huge rock then he felt that the right hour had come for sharing with them the wonderful things that had come to him it was perhaps the loveliest of all hours in the year the summer was young and soft and this was the warmest evening they had yet had dusky dark even below while above the stars were bright and large and sharp in the blackest blue sky the night came close around them clasping them in one universal arm of love and although it neither spoke nor smiled seemed all eye and ear seemed to see and hear and know everything they said and did it is a way the night has sometimes and there is a reason for it the only sound was that of the brook for there was no wind and no trees for it to make its music upon if there had been for the cottage was high up on the mountain on a great shoulder of stone where trees would not grow there to the accompaniment of the water as it hurried down to the valley and the sea talking busily of a thousand true things which it could not understand curdie told his tale outside and in to his father and mother what a world had slipped in between the mouth of the mine and his mother's cottage neither of them said a word until he had ended now what am i to make of it mother it's so strange he said and stopped it's easy enough to see what curdie has got to make of it isn't it peter said the good woman turning her face toward all she could see of her husband's it seems so to me answered peter with a smile which only the night saw but his wife felt in the tone of his words they were the happiest couple in that country because they always understood each other and that was because they always meant the same thing and that was because they always loved what was fair and true and right better not than anything else but than everything else put together then will you tell curdie said she you can talk best joan said he you tell him and i will listen and learn how to say what i think he added i said curdie don't know what to think it does not matter so much said his mother if only you know what to make of a thing you'll know soon enough what to think of it now i needn't tell you surely curdie what you've got to do with this i suppose you mean mother answered curdie that i must do as the old lady told me that is what i mean what else could it be am i not right peter quite right joan answered peter so far as my judgement goes it is a very strange story but you see the question is not about believing it for curdie knows what came to him and you remember curdie said his mother that when the princess took you up that tower once before and there talked to her great great grandmother you came home quite angry with her and said there was nothing in the place but an old tub a heap of straw oh i remember your inventory quite well an old tub a heap of straw a withered apple and a sunbeam according to your eyes that was all there was in the great old musty garret but now you have had a glimpse of the old princess herself yes mother i did see her or if i didn't said curdie very thoughtfully then began again the hardest thing to believe though i saw it with my own eyes was when the thin filmy creature that seemed almost to float about in the moonlight like a bit of the silver paper they put over pictures or like a handkerchief made of spider threads took my hand and rose up she was taller and stronger than you mother ever so much at least she looked so and most certainly was so curdie if she looked so said mrs peterson well i confess returned her son that one thing if there were no other would make me doubt whether i was not dreaming after all wide awake though i fancied myself to be of course answered his mother it is not for me to say whether you were dreaming or not if you are doubtful of it yourself but it doesn't make me think i am dreaming when in the summer i hold in my hand the bunch of sweet peas that make my heart glad with their colour and scent and remember the dry withered looking little thing i dibbled into the hole in the same spot in the spring i only think how wonderful and lovely it all is it seems just as full of reason as it is of wonder how it is done i can't tell only there it is and there is this in it too curdie of which you would not be so ready to think that when you come home to your father and mother and they find you behaving more like a dear good son than you have behaved for a long time they at least are not likely to think you were only dreaming still said curdie looking a little ashamed i might have dreamed my duty then dream often my son for there must then be more truth in your dreams than in your waking thoughts but however any of these things may be this one point remains certain there can be no harm in doing as she told you and indeed until you are sure there is no such person you are bound to do it for you promised it seems to me said his father that if a lady comes to you in a dream curdie and tells you not to talk about her when you wake the least you can do is to hold your tongue true father yes mother i'll do it said curdie then they went to bed and sleep which is the night of the soul next took them in its arms and made them well chapter 5 the miners it much increased curdie's feeling of the strangeness of the whole affair that the next morning when they were at work in the mine the party of which he and his father were two just as if they had known what had happened to him the night before began talking about all manner of wonderful tales that were abroad in the country chiefly of course those connected with the mines and the mountains in which they lay their wives and mothers and grandmothers were their chief authorities for when they sat by their firesides they heard their wives telling their children the selfsame tales with little differences and here and there one they had not heard before which they had heard their mothers and grandmothers tell in one or other of the same cottages at length they came to speak of a certain strange being they called old mother wotherwop some said their wives had seen her it appeared as they talked that not one had seen her more than once some of their mothers and grandmothers however had seen her also and they all had told them tales about her when they were children they said she could take any shape she liked but that in reality she was a withered old woman so old and so withered that she was as thin as a sieve with a lamp behind it that she was never seen except at night and when something terrible had taken place or was going to take place such as the falling in of the roof of a mine or the breaking out of water in it she had more than once been seen it was always at night beside some well sitting on the brink of it and leaning over and stirring it with her forefinger which was six times as long as any of the rest and whoever for months after drank of that well was sure to be ill to this one of them however added that he remembered his mother saying that whoever in bad health drank of the well was sure to get better but the majority agreed that the former was the right version of the story for was she not a witch an old hating witch whose delight was to do mischief one said he had heard that she took the shape of a young woman sometimes as beautiful as an angel and then was most dangerous of all for she struck every man who looked upon her stone blind peter ventured the question whether she might not as likely be an angel that took the form of an old woman as an old woman that took the form of an angel but nobody except curdie who was holding his peace with all his might saw any sense in the question they said an old woman might be very glad to make herself look like a young one but who ever heard of a young and beautiful one making herself look old and ugly peter asked why they were so much more ready to believe the bad that was said of her than the good they answered because she was bad he asked why they believed her to be bad and they answered because she did bad things when he asked how they knew that they said because she was a bad creature even if they didn't know it they said a woman like that was so much more likely to be bad than good why did she go about at night why did she appear only now and then and on such occasions one went on to tell how one night when his grandfather had been having a jolly time of it with his friends in the market town she had served him so upon his way home that the poor man never drank a drop of anything stronger than water after it to the day of his death she dragged him into a bog and tumbled him up and down in it till he was nearly dead i suppose that was her way of teaching him what a good thing water was said peter but the man who liked strong drink did not see the joke they do say said another that she has lived in the old house over there ever since the little princess left it they say too that the housekeeper knows all about it and is hand and glove with the old witch i don't doubt they have many a nice airing together on broomsticks but i don't doubt either it's all nonsense and there's no such person at all when our cow died said another she was seen going round and round the cowhouse the same night to be sure she left a fine calf behind her i mean the cow did not the witch i wonder she didn't kill that too for she'll be a far finer cow than ever her mother was my old woman came upon her one night not long before the water broke out in the mine sitting on a stone on the hillside with a whole congregation of cobs about her when they saw my wife they all scampered off as fast as they could run and where the witch was sitting there was nothing to be seen but a withered bracken bush i made no doubt myself she was putting them up to it and so they went on with one foolish tale after another while peter put in a word now and then and curdie diligently held his peace but his silence at last drew attention upon it and one of them said come young curdie what are you thinking of how do you know i'm thinking of anything asked curdie because you're not saying anything does it follow then that as you are saying so much you're not thinking at all said curdie i know"
