"1" "i always do what could take him from home by night and every night i called up all the strange tales i had ever heard of dark and secret deeds committed in great towns and escaping detection for a long series of years wild as many of these stories were i could not find one adapted to this mystery which only became the more impenetrable in proportion as i sought to solve it occupied with such thoughts as these and a crowd of others all tending to the same point i continued to pace the street for two long hours at length the rain began to descend heavily and then over powered by fatigue though no less interested than i had been at first i engaged the nearest coach and so got home a cheerful fire was blazing on the hearth the lamp burnt brightly my clock received me with its old familiar welcome everything was quiet warm and cheering and in happy contrast to the gloom and darkness i had quitted but all that night waking or in my sleep the same thoughts recurred and the same images retained possession of my brain i had ever before me the old dark murky rooms the gaunt suits of mail with their ghostly silent air the faces all awry grinning from wood and stone the dust and rust and worm that lives in wood and alone in the midst of all this lumber and decay and ugly age the beautiful child in her gentle slumber smiling through her light and sunny dreams chapter 2 after combating for nearly a week the feeling which impelled me to revisit the place i had quitted under the circumstances already detailed i yielded to it at length and determining that this time i would present myself by the light of day bent my steps thither early in the morning i walked past the house and took several turns in the street with that kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that the visit he is about to pay is unexpected and may not be very acceptable however as the door of the shop was shut and it did not appear likely that i should be recognized by those within if i continued merely to pass up and down before it i soon conquered this irresolution and found myself in the curiosity dealer's warehouse the old man and another person were together in the back part and there seemed to have been high words between them for their voices which were raised to a very high pitch suddenly stopped on my entering and the old man advancing hastily towards me said in a tremulous tone that he was very glad i had come you interrupted us at a critical moment said he pointing to the man whom i had found in company with him this fellow will murder me one of these days he would have done so long ago if he had dared bah you would swear away my life if you could returned the other after bestowing a stare and a frown on me we all know that i almost think i could cried the old man turning feebly upon him if oaths or prayers or words could rid me of you they should i would be quit of you and would be relieved if you were dead i know it returned the other i said so didn't i but neither oaths or prayers nor words will kill me and therefore i live and mean to live and his mother died cried the old man passionately clasping his hands and looking upward and this is heaven's justice the other stood lounging with his foot upon a chair and regarded him with a contemptuous sneer he was a young man of one and twenty or thereabouts well made and certainly handsome though the expression of his face was far from prepossessing having in common with his manner and even his dress a dissipated insolent air which repelled one justice or no justice said the young fellow here i am and here i shall stop till such time as i think fit to go unless you send for assistance to put me out which you won't do i know i tell you again that i want to see my sister your sister said the old man bitterly ah you can't change the relationship returned the other if you could you'd have done it long ago i want to see my sister that you keep cooped up here poisoning her mind with your sly secrets and pretending an affection for her that you may work her to death and add a few scraped shillings every week to the money you can hardly count i want to see her and i will here's a moralist to talk of poisoned minds here's a generous spirit to scorn scraped up shillings cried the old man turning from him to me a profligate sir who has forfeited every claim not only upon those who have the misfortune to be of his blood but upon society which knows nothing of him but his misdeeds a liar too he added in a lower voice as he drew closer to me who knows how dear she is to me and seeks to wound me even there because there is a stranger nearby strangers are nothing to me grandfather said the young fellow catching at the word nor i to them i hope the best they can do is to keep an eye to their business and leave me to mine there's a friend of mine waiting outside and as it seems that i may have to wait some time i'll call him in with your leave saying this he stepped to the door and looking down the street beckoned several times to some unseen person who to judge from the air of impatience with which these signals were accompanied required a great quantity of persuasion to induce him to advance at length there sauntered up on the opposite side of the way with a bad pretense of passing by accident a figure conspicuous for its dirty smartness which after a great many frowns and jerks of the head in resistance of the invitation ultimately crossed the road and was brought into the shop there it's dick swiveller said the young fellow pushing him in sit down swiveller but is the old min agreeable said mr swiveller in an undertone mr swiveller complied and looking about him with a propitiatory smile observed that last week was a fine week for the ducks and this week was a fine week for the dust he also observed that whilst standing by the post at the street corner he had observed a pig with a straw in his mouth issuing out of the tobacco shop from which appearance he augured that another fine week for the ducks was approaching and that rain would certainly ensue he furthermore took occasion to apologize for any negligence that might be perceptible in his dress on the ground that last night he had had the sun very strong in his eyes by which expression he was understood to convey to his hearers in the most delicate manner possible the information that he had been extremely drunk but what said mr swiveller with a sigh what is the odds so long as the fire of soul is kindled at the taper of conwiviality and the wing of friendship never moults a feather what is the odds so long as the spirit is expanded by means of rosy wine and the present moment is the least happiest of our existence you needn't act the chairman here said his friend half aside fred cried mr swiveller tapping his nose a word to the wise is sufficient for them we may be good and happy without riches fred say not another syllable i know my cue smart is the word only one little whisper fred is the old min friendly never you mind replied his friend right again quite right said mr swiveller caution is the word and caution is the act with that he winked as if in preservation of some deep secret and folding his arms and leaning back in his chair looked up at the ceiling with profound gravity it was perhaps not very unreasonable to suspect from what had already passed that mr swiveller was not quite recovered from the effects of the powerful sunlight to which he had made allusion but if no such suspicion had been awakened by his speech his wiry hair dull eyes and sallow face would still have been strong witnesses against him his attire was not as he had himself hinted remarkable for the nicest arrangement but was in a state of disorder which strongly induced the idea that he had gone to bed in it it consisted of a brown body coat with a great many brass buttons up the front and only one behind a bright check neckerchief a plaid waistcoat soiled white trousers and a very limp hat worn with the wrong side foremost to hide a hole in the brim the breast of his coat was ornamented with an outside pocket from which there peeped forth the cleanest end of a very large and very ill favoured handkerchief his dirty wristbands were pulled on as far as possible and ostentatiously folded back over his cuffs he displayed no gloves and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with the semblance of a ring on its little finger and a black ball in its grasp with all these personal advantages to which may be added a strong savour of tobacco smoke and a prevailing greasiness of appearance mr swiveller leant back in his chair with his eyes fixed on the ceiling and occasionally pitching his voice to the needful key obliged the company with a few bars of an intensely dismal air and then in the middle of a note relapsed into his former silence the old man sat himself down in a chair and with folded hands looked sometimes at his grandson and sometimes at his strange companion as if he were utterly powerless and had no resource but to leave them to do as they pleased the young man reclined against a table at no great distance from his friend in apparent indifference to everything that had passed and i who felt the difficulty of any interference notwithstanding that the old man had appealed to me both by words and looks made the best feint i could of being occupied in examining some of the goods that were disposed for sale and paying very little attention to a person before me the silence was not of long duration for mr swiveller after favouring us with several melodious assurances that his heart was in the highlands and that he wanted but his arab steed as a preliminary to the achievement of great feats of valour and loyalty removed his eyes from the ceiling and subsided into prose again fred said mr swiveller stopping short as if the idea had suddenly occurred to him and speaking in the same audible whisper as before is the old min friendly what does it matter returned his friend peevishly no but is he said dick yes of course what do i care whether he is or not emboldened as it seemed by this reply to enter into a more general conversation mr swiveller plainly laid himself out to captivate our attention he began by remarking that soda water though a good thing in the abstract was apt to lie cold upon the stomach unless qualified with ginger or a small infusion of brandy which latter article he held to be preferable in all cases saving for the one consideration of expense nobody venturing to dispute these positions he proceeded to observe that the human hair was a great retainer of tobacco smoke and that the young gentlemen of westminster and eton after eating vast quantities of apples to conceal any scent of cigars from their anxious friends were usually detected in consequence of their heads possessing this remarkable property when he concluded that if the royal society would turn their attention to the circumstance and endeavour to find in the resources of science a means of preventing such untoward revelations they might indeed be looked upon as benefactors to mankind these opinions being equally incontrovertible with those he had already pronounced he went on to inform us that jamaica rum though unquestionably an agreeable spirit of great richness and flavour had the drawback of remaining constantly present to the taste next day and nobody being venturous enough to argue this point either he increased in confidence and became yet more companionable and communicative it's a devil of a thing gentlemen said mr swiveller when relations fall out and disagree if the wing of friendship should never moult a feather the wing of relationship should never be clipped but be always expanded and serene why should a grandson and grandfather peg away at each other with mutual wiolence when all might be bliss and concord why not jine hands and forgit it hold your tongue said his friend sir replied mr swiveller don't you interrupt the chair gentlemen how does the case stand upon the present occasion here is a jolly old grandfather i say it with the utmost respect and here is a wild young grandson the jolly old grandfather says to the wild young grandson i have brought you up and educated you fred i have put you in the way of getting on in life you have bolted a little out of course as young fellows often do and you shall never have another chance nor the ghost of half a one the wild young grandson makes answer to this and says you're as rich as rich can be you have been at no uncommon expense on my account you're saving up piles of money for my little sister that lives with you in a secret stealthy hugger muggering kind of way and with no manner of enjoyment why can't you stand a trifle for your grown up relation the jolly old grandfather unto this retorts not only that he declines to fork out with that cheerful readiness which is always so agreeable and pleasant in a gentleman of his time of life but that he will bow up and call names and make reflections whenever they meet then the plain question is an't it a pity that this state of things should continue and how much better would it be for the gentleman to hand over a reasonable amount of tin and make it all right and comfortable having delivered this oration with a great many waves and flourishes of the hand mr swiveller abruptly thrust the head of his cane into his mouth as if to prevent himself from impairing the effect of his speech by adding one other word why do you hunt and persecute me god help me said the old man turning to his grandson why do you bring your prolifigate companions here how often am i to tell you that my life is one of care and self denial and that i am poor how often am i to tell you returned the other looking coldly at him that i know better you have chosen your own path said the old man follow it leave nell and me to toil and work nell will be a woman soon returned the other and bred in your faith she'll forget her brother unless he shows himself sometimes take care said the old man with sparkling eyes that she does not forget you when you would have her memory keenest take care that the day don't come when you walk barefoot in the streets and she rides by in a gay carriage of her own you mean when she has your money retorted the other how like a poor man he talks and yet said the old man dropping his voice and speaking like one who thinks aloud how poor we are and what a life it is the cause is a young child's guiltless of all harm or wrong but nothing goes well with it hope and patience hope and patience these words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the young men mr swiveller appeared to think that they implied some mental struggle consequent upon the powerful effect of his address for he poked his friend with his cane and whispered his conviction that he had administered a clincher and that he expected a commission on the profits discovering his mistake after a while he appeared to grow rather sleepy and discontented and had more than once suggested the propriety of an immediate departure when the door opened and the child herself appeared chapter 3 the child was closely followed by an elderly man of remarkably hard features and forbidding aspect and so low in stature as to be quite a dwarf though his head and face were large enough for the body of a giant his black eyes were restless sly and cunning his mouth and chin bristly with the stubble of a coarse hard beard and his complexion was one of that kind which never looks clean or wholesome but what added most to the grotesque expression of his face was a ghastly smile which appearing to be the mere result of habit and to have no connection with any mirthful or complacent feeling constantly revealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his mouth and gave him the aspect of a panting dog his dress consisted of a large high crowned hat a worn dark suit a pair of capacious shoes and a dirty white neckerchief sufficiently limp and crumpled to disclose the greater portion of his wiry throat such hair as he had was of a grizzled black cut short and straight upon his temples and hanging in a frowzy fringe about his ears his hands which were of a rough coarse grain were very dirty his fingernails were crooked long and yellow there was ample time to note these particulars for besides that they were sufficiently obvious without very close observation some moments elapsed before any one broke silence the child advanced timidly towards her brother and put her hand in his the dwarf if we may call him so glanced keenly at all present and the curiosity dealer who plainly had not expected his uncouth visitor seemed disconcerted and embarrassed ah said the dwarf who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively that should be your grandson neighbour say rather that he should not be replied the old man but he is and that said the dwarf pointing to dick swiveller some friend of his as welcome here as he said the old man and that inquired the dwarf wheeling round and pointing straight at me a gentleman who was so good as to bring nell home the other night when she lost her way coming from your house the little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his wonder but as she was talking to the young man held his peace and bent his head to listen well nelly said the young fellow aloud do they teach you to hate me eh no no for shame oh no cried the child to love me perhaps pursued her brother with a sneer to do neither she returned they never speak to me about you indeed they never do i dare be bound for that he said darting a bitter look at the grandfather i dare be bound for that nell oh i believe you there but i love you dearly fred said the child no doubt i do indeed and always will the child repeated with great emotion but oh if you would leave off vexing him and making him unhappy then i could love you more i see said the young man as he stooped carelessly over the child and having kissed her pushed her from him there get you away now you have said your lesson you needn't whimper we part good friends enough if that's the matter he remained silent following her with his eyes until she had gained her little room and closed the door and then turning to the dwarf said abruptly harkee mr meaning me returned the dwarf quilp is my name you might remember it's not a long one daniel quilp harkee mr quilp then pursued the other you have some influence with my grandfather there some said mr quilp emphatically and are in a few of his mysteries and secrets a few replied quilp with equal dryness then let me tell him once for all through you that i will come into and go out of this place as often as i like so long as he keeps nell here and that if he wants to be quit of me he must first be quit of her what have i done to be made a bugbear of and to be shunned and dreaded as if i brought the plague he'll tell you that i have no natural affection and that i care no more for nell for her own sake than i do for him let him say so i care for the whim then of coming to and fro and reminding her of my existence i will see her when i please that's my point i came here to day to maintain it and i'll come here again fifty times with the same object and always with the same success i said i would stop till i had gained it i have done so and now my visit's ended come dick stop cried mr swiveller as his companion turned toward the door sir sir i am your humble servant said mr quilp to whom the monosyllable was addressed before i leave the gay and festive scene and halls of dazzling light sir said mr swiveller i will with your permission attempt a slight remark i came here sir this day under the impression that the old min was friendly proceed sir said daniel quilp for the orator had made a sudden stop inspired by this idea and the sentiments it awakened sir and feeling as a mutual friend that badgering baiting and bullying was not the sort of thing calculated to expand the souls and promote the social harmony of the contending parties i took upon myself to suggest a course which is the course to be adopted to the present occasion will you allow me to whisper half a syllable sir without waiting for the permission he sought mr swiveller stepped up to the dwarf and leaning on his shoulder and stooping down to get at his ear said in a voice which was perfectly audible to all present the watch word to the old min is fork is what demanded quilp is fork sir fork replied mr swiveller slapping his pocket you are awake sir the dwarf nodded mr swiveller drew back and nodded likewise then drew a little further back and nodded again and so on by these means he in time reached the door where he gave a great cough to attract the dwarf's attention and gain an opportunity of expressing in dumb show the closest confidence and most inviolable secrecy having performed the serious pantomime that was necessary for the due conveyance of these idea he cast himself upon his friend's track and vanished humph said the dwarf with a sour look and a shrug of his shoulders so much for dear relations thank god i acknowledge none nor need you either he added turning to the old man if you were not as weak as a reed and nearly as senseless what would you have me do he retorted in a kind of helpless desperation it is easy to talk and sneer what would you have me do what would i do if i was in your case said the dwarf something violent no doubt you're right there returned the little man highly gratified by the compliment for such he evidently considered it and grinning like a devil as he rubbed his dirty hands together ask mrs quilp pretty mrs quilp obedient timid loving mrs quilp but that reminds me i have left her all alone and she will be anxious and know not a moment's peace till i return i know she's always in that condition when i'm away thought she doesn't dare to say so unless i lead her on and tell her she may speak freely and i won't be angry with her oh well trained mrs quilp the creature appeared quite horrible with his monstrous head and little body as he rubbed his hands slowly round and round and round again with something fantastic even in his manner of performing this slight action and dropping his shaggy brows and cocking his chin in the air glanced upward with a stealthy look of exultation that an imp might have copied and appropriated to himself here he said putting his hand into his breast and sidling up to the old man as he spoke i brought it myself for fear of accidents as being in gold it was something large and heavy for nell to carry in her bag she need be accustomed to such loads betimes though neighbor for she will carry weight when you are dead heaven send she may i hope so said the old man with something like a groan hope so echoed the dwarf approaching close to his ear neighbour i would i knew in what good investment all these supplies are sunk but you are a deep man and keep your secret close my secret said the other with a haggard look yes you're right i i keep it close very close he said no more but taking the money turned away with a slow uncertain step and pressed his hand upon his head like a weary and dejected man the dwarf watched him sharply while he passed into the little sitting room and locked it in an iron safe above the chimney piece and after musing for a short space prepared to take his leave observing that unless he made good haste mrs quilp would certainly be in fits on his return and so neighbour he added i'll turn my face homewards leaving my love for nelly and hoping she may never lose her way again though her doing so has procured me an honour i didn't expect with that he bowed and leered at me and with a keen glance around which seemed to comprehend every object within his range of vision however small or trivial went his way i had several times essayed to go myself but the old man had always opposed it and entreated me to remain as he renewed his entreaties on our being left along and adverted with many thanks to the former occasion of our being together i willingly yielded to his persuasions and sat down pretending to examine some curious miniatures and a few old medals which he placed before me it needed no great pressing to induce me to stay for if my curiosity has been excited on the occasion of my first visit it certainly was not diminished now nell joined us before long and bringing some needle work to the table sat by the old man's side it was pleasant to observe the fresh flowers in the room the pet bird with a green bough shading his little cage the breath of freshness and youth which seemed to rustle through the old dull house and hover round the child it was curious but not so pleasant to turn from the beauty and grace of the girl to the stooping figure care worn face and jaded aspect of the old man as he grew weaker and more feeble what would become of this lonely little creature poor protector as he was say that he died what would be her fate then the old man almost answered my thoughts as he laid his hand on hers and spoke aloud i'll be of better cheer nell he said there must be good fortune in store for thee i do not ask it for myself but thee such miseries must fall on thy innocent head without it that i cannot believe but that being tempted it will come at last she looked cheerfully into his face but made no answer when i think said he of the many years many in thy short life that thou has lived with me of my monotonous existence knowing no companions of thy own age nor any childish pleasures of the solitude in which thou has grown to be what thou art and in which thou hast lived apart from nearly all thy kind but one old man i sometimes fear i have dealt hardly by thee nell grandfather cried the child in unfeigned surprise not in intention no no said he i have ever looked forward to the time that should enable thee to mix among the gayest and prettiest and take thy station with the best but i still look forward nell i still look forward and if i should be forced to leave thee meanwhile how have i fitted thee for struggles with the world the poor bird yonder is as well qualified to encounter it and be turned adrift upon its mercies hark i hear kit outside go to him nell go to him"
