frantically and all the while he roared and growled terrifically the blacks were elated for while they had not built their trap for this hairy tree man they were delighted with their catch tarzan pricked up his ears when he heard the voice of a great ape and circling quickly until he was down wind from the trap he sniffed at the air in search of the scent spoor of the prisoner nor was it long before there came to those delicate nostrils the familiar odor that told tarzan the identity of the captive as unerringly as though he had looked upon taug with his eyes yes it was taug and he was alone tarzan grinned as he approached to discover what the blacks would do to their prisoner doubtless they would slay him at once again tarzan grinned now he could have teeka for his own with none to dispute his right to her as he watched he saw the black warriors strip the screen from about the cage fasten ropes to it and drag it away along the trail in the direction of their village tarzan watched until his rival passed out of sight still beating upon the bars of his prison and growling out his anger and his threats then the ape boy turned and swung rapidly off in search of the tribe and teeka once upon the journey he surprised sheeta and his family in a little overgrown clearing the great cat lay stretched upon the ground while his mate one paw across her lord's savage face licked at the soft white fur at his throat tarzan increased his speed then until he fairly flew through the forest nor was it long before he came upon the tribe he saw them before they saw him for of all the jungle creatures none passed more quietly than tarzan of the apes he saw kamma and her mate feeding side by side their hairy bodies rubbing against each other and he saw teeka feeding by herself not for long would she feed thus in loneliness thought tarzan as with a bound he landed amongst them there was a startled rush and a chorus of angry and frightened snarls for tarzan had surprised them but there was more too than mere nervous shock to account for the bristling neck hair which remained standing long after the apes had discovered the identity of the newcomer tarzan noticed this as he had noticed it many times in the past that always his sudden coming among them left them nervous and unstrung for a considerable time and that they one and all found it necessary to satisfy themselves that he was indeed tarzan by smelling about him a half dozen or more times before they calmed down pushing through them he made his way toward teeka but as he approached her the ape drew away teeka he said it is tarzan you belong to tarzan i have come for you the ape drew closer looking him over carefully finally she sniffed at him as though to make assurance doubly sure where is taug she asked the gomangani have him replied tarzan they will kill him in the eyes of the she tarzan saw a wistful expression and a troubled look of sorrow as he told her of taug's fate but she came quite close and snuggled against him and tarzan lord greystoke put his arm about her as he did so he noticed with a start the strange incongruity of that smooth brown arm against the black and hairy coat of his lady love he recalled the paw of sheeta's mate across sheeta's face no incongruity there he thought of little manu hugging his she and how the one seemed to belong to the other even the proud male bird with his gay plumage bore a close resemblance to his quieter spouse while numa but for his shaggy mane was almost a counterpart of sabor the lioness the males and the females differed it was true but not with such differences as existed between tarzan and teeka tarzan was puzzled there was something wrong his arm dropped from the shoulder of teeka very slowly he drew away from her she looked at him with her head cocked upon one side tarzan rose to his full height and beat upon his breast with his fists he raised his head toward the heavens and opened his mouth from the depths of his lungs rose the fierce weird challenge of the victorious bull ape the tribe turned curiously to eye him he had killed nothing nor was there any antagonist to be goaded to madness by the savage scream no there was no excuse for it and they turned back to their feeding but with an eye upon the ape man lest he be preparing to suddenly run amuck as they watched him they saw him swing into a near by tree and disappear from sight then they forgot him even teeka mbonga's black warriors sweating beneath their strenuous task and resting often made slow progress toward their village always the savage beast in the primitive cage growled and roared when they moved him he beat upon the bars and slavered at the mouth his noise was hideous they had almost completed their journey and were making their final rest before forging ahead to gain the clearing in which lay their village a few more minutes would have taken them out of the forest and then doubtless the thing would not have happened which did happen a silent figure moved through the trees above them keen eyes inspected the cage and counted the number of warriors an alert and daring brain figured upon the chances of success when a certain plan should be put to the test tarzan watched the blacks lolling in the shade they were exhausted already several of them slept he crept closer pausing just above them not a leaf rustled before his stealthy advance he waited in the infinite patience of the beast of prey presently but two of the warriors remained awake and one of these was dozing tarzan of the apes gathered himself and as he did so the black who did not sleep arose and passed around to the rear of the cage the ape boy followed just above his head taug was eyeing the warrior and emitting low growls tarzan feared that the anthropoid would awaken the sleepers in a whisper which was inaudible to the ears of the negro tarzan whispered taug's name cautioning the ape to silence and taug's growling ceased the black approached the rear of the cage and examined the fastenings of the door and as he stood there the beast above him launched itself from the tree full upon his back steel fingers circled his throat choking the cry which sprang to the lips of the terrified man strong teeth fastened themselves in his shoulder and powerful legs wound themselves about his torso the black in a frenzy of terror tried to dislodge the silent thing which clung to him he threw himself to the ground and rolled about but still those mighty fingers closed more and more tightly their deadly grip the man's mouth gaped wide his swollen tongue protruded his eyes started from their sockets but the relentless fingers only increased their pressure taug was a silent witness of the struggle in his fierce little brain he doubtless wondered what purpose prompted tarzan to attack the black taug had not forgotten his recent battle with the ape boy nor the cause of it now he saw the form of the gomangani suddenly go limp there was a convulsive shiver and the man lay still tarzan sprang from his prey and ran to the door of the cage with nimble fingers he worked rapidly at the thongs which held the door in place taug could only watch he could not help presently tarzan pushed the thing up a couple of feet and taug crawled out the ape would have turned upon the sleeping blacks that he might wreak his pent vengeance but tarzan would not permit it instead the ape boy dragged the body of the black within the cage and propped it against the side bars then he lowered the door and made fast the thongs as they had been before a happy smile lighted his features as he worked for one of his principal diversions was the baiting of the blacks of mbonga's village he could imagine their terror when they awoke and found the dead body of their comrade fast in the cage where they had left the great ape safely secured but a few minutes before tarzan and taug took to the trees together the shaggy coat of the fierce ape brushing the sleek skin of the english lordling as they passed through the primeval jungle side by side go back to teeka said tarzan she is yours tarzan does not want her tarzan has found another she asked taug the ape boy shrugged for the gomangani there is another gomangani he said for numa the lion there is sabor the lioness for sheeta there is a she of his own kind for bara the deer for manu the monkey for all the beasts and the birds of the jungle is there a mate only for tarzan of the apes is there none taug is an ape teeka is an ape go back to teeka tarzan is a man he will go alone 2 the capture of tarzan the black warriors labored in the humid heat of the jungle's stifling shade with war spears they loosened the thick black loam and the deep layers of rotting vegetation with heavy nailed fingers they scooped away the disintegrated earth from the center of the age old game trail often they ceased their labors to squat resting and gossiping with much laughter at the edge of the pit they were digging against the boles of near by trees leaned their long oval shields of thick buffalo hide and the spears of those who were doing the scooping sweat glistened upon their smooth ebon skins beneath which rolled rounded muscles supple in the perfection of nature's uncontaminated health a reed buck stepping warily along the trail toward water halted as a burst of laughter broke upon his startled ears for a moment he stood statuesque but for his sensitively dilating nostrils then he wheeled and fled noiselessly from the terrifying presence of man a hundred yards away deep in the tangle of impenetrable jungle numa the lion raised his massive head numa had dined well until almost daybreak and it had required much noise to awaken him now he lifted his muzzle and sniffed the air caught the acrid scent spoor of the reed buck and the heavy scent of man but numa was well filled with a low disgusted grunt he rose and slunk away brilliantly plumaged birds with raucous voices darted from tree to tree little monkeys chattering and scolding swung through the swaying limbs above the black warriors yet they were alone for the teeming jungle with all its myriad life like the swarming streets of a great metropolis is one of the loneliest spots in god's great universe but were they alone above them lightly balanced upon a leafy tree limb a gray eyed youth watched with eager intentness their every move the fire of hate restrained smoldered beneath the lad's evident desire to know the purpose of the black men's labors such a one as these it was who had slain his beloved kala for them there could be naught but enmity yet he liked well to watch them avid as he was for greater knowledge of the ways of man he saw the pit grow in depth until a great hole yawned the width of the trail a hole which was amply large enough to hold at one time all of the six excavators tarzan could not guess the purpose of so great a labor and when they cut long stakes sharpened at their upper ends and set them at intervals upright in the bottom of the pit his wonderment but increased nor was it satisfied with the placing of the light cross poles over the pit or the careful arrangement of leaves and earth which completely hid from view the work the black men had performed when they were done they surveyed their handiwork with evident satisfaction and tarzan surveyed it too even to his practiced eye there remained scarce a vestige of evidence that the ancient game trail had been tampered with in any way so absorbed was the ape man in speculation as to the purpose of the covered pit that he permitted the blacks to depart in the direction of their village without the usual baiting which had rendered him the terror of mbonga's people and had afforded tarzan both a vehicle of revenge and a source of inexhaustible delight puzzle as he would however he could not solve the mystery of the concealed pit for the ways of the blacks were still strange ways to tarzan they had entered his jungle but a short time before the first of their kind to encroach upon the age old supremacy of the beasts which laired there to numa the lion to tantor the elephant to the great apes and the lesser apes to each and all of the myriad creatures of this savage wild the ways of man were new they had much to learn of these black hairless creatures that walked erect upon their hind paws and they were learning it slowly and always to their sorrow shortly after the blacks had departed tarzan swung easily to the trail sniffing suspiciously he circled the edge of the pit squatting upon his haunches he scraped away a little earth to expose one of the cross bars he sniffed at this touched it cocked his head upon one side and contemplated it gravely for several minutes then he carefully re covered it arranging the earth as neatly as had the blacks this done he swung himself back among the branches of the trees and moved off in search of his hairy fellows the great apes of the tribe of kerchak once he crossed the trail of numa the lion pausing for a moment to hurl a soft fruit at the snarling face of his enemy and to taunt and insult him calling him eater of carrion and brother of dango the hyena numa his yellow green eyes round and burning with concentrated hate glared up at the dancing figure above him low growls vibrated his heavy jowls and his great rage transmitted to his sinuous tail a sharp whiplike motion but realizing from past experience the futility of long distance argument with the ape man he turned presently and struck off into the tangled vegetation which hid him from the view of his tormentor with a final scream of jungle invective and an apelike grimace at his departing foe tarzan continued along his way another mile and a shifting wind brought to his keen nostrils a familiar pungent odor close at hand and a moment later there loomed beneath him a huge gray black bulk forging steadily along the jungle trail tarzan seized and broke a small tree limb and at the sudden cracking sound the ponderous figure halted great ears were thrown forward and a long supple trunk rose quickly to wave to and fro in search of the scent of an enemy while two weak little eyes peered suspiciously and futilely about in quest of the author of the noise which had disturbed his peaceful way tarzan laughed aloud and came closer above the head of the pachyderm tantor tantor he cried bara the deer is less fearful than you you tantor the elephant greatest of the jungle folk with the strength of as many numas as i have toes upon my feet and fingers upon my hands tantor who can uproot great trees trembles with fear at the sound of a broken twig a rumbling noise which might have been either a sign of contempt or a sigh of relief was tantor's only reply as the uplifted trunk and ears came down and the beast's tail dropped to normal but his eyes still roved about in search of tarzan he was not long kept in suspense however as to the whereabouts of the ape man for a second later the youth dropped lightly to the broad head of his old friend then stretching himself at full length he drummed with his bare toes upon the thick hide and as his fingers scratched the more tender surfaces beneath the great ears he talked to tantor of the gossip of the jungle as though the great beast understood every word that he said much there was which tarzan could make tantor understand and though the small talk of the wild was beyond the great gray dreadnaught of the jungle he stood with blinking eyes and gently swaying trunk as though drinking in every word of it with keenest appreciation as a matter of fact it was the pleasant friendly voice and caressing hands behind his ears which he enjoyed and the close proximity of him whom he had often borne upon his back since tarzan as a little child had once fearlessly approached the great bull assuming upon the part of the pachyderm the same friendliness which filled his own heart in the years of their association tarzan had discovered that he possessed an inexplicable power to govern and direct his mighty friend at his bidding tantor would come from a great distance as far as his keen ears could detect the shrill and piercing summons of the ape man and when tarzan was squatted upon his head tantor would lumber through the jungle in any direction which his rider bade him go it was the power of the man mind over that of the brute and it was just as effective as though both fully understood its origin though neither did for half an hour tarzan sprawled there upon tantor's back time had no meaning for either of them life as they saw it consisted principally in keeping their stomachs filled to tarzan this was a less arduous labor than to tantor for tarzan's stomach was smaller and being omnivorous food was less difficult to obtain if one sort did not come readily to hand there were always many others to satisfy his hunger he was less particular as to his diet than tantor who would eat only the bark of certain trees and the wood of others while a third appealed to him only through its leaves and these perhaps just at certain seasons of the year tantor must needs spend the better part of his life in filling his immense stomach against the needs of his mighty thews it is thus with all the lower orders their lives are so occupied either with searching for food or with the processes of digestion that they have little time for other considerations doubtless it is this handicap which has kept them from advancing as rapidly as man who has more time to give to thought upon other matters however these questions troubled tarzan but little and tantor not at all what the former knew was that he was happy in the companionship of the elephant he did not know why he did not know that because he was a human being a normal healthy human being he craved some living thing upon which to lavish his affection his childhood playmates among the apes of kerchak were now great sullen brutes they felt nor inspired but little affection the younger apes tarzan still played with occasionally in his savage way he loved them but they were far from satisfying or restful companions tantor was a great mountain of calm of poise of stability it was restful and satisfying to sprawl upon his rough pate and pour one's vague hopes and aspirations into the great ears which flapped ponderously to and fro in apparent understanding of all the jungle folk tantor commanded tarzan's greatest love since kala had been taken from him sometimes tarzan wondered if tantor reciprocated his affection it was difficult to know it was the call of the stomach the most compelling and insistent call which the jungle knows that took tarzan finally back to the trees and off in search of food while tantor continued his interrupted journey in the opposite direction for an hour the ape man foraged a lofty nest yielded its fresh warm harvest fruits berries and tender plantain found a place upon his menu in the order that he happened upon them for he did not seek such foods meat meat meat it was always meat that tarzan of the apes hunted but sometimes meat eluded him as today and as he roamed the jungle his active mind busied itself not alone with his hunting but with many other subjects he had a habit of recalling often the events of the preceding days and hours he lived over his visit with tantor he cogitated upon the digging blacks and the strange covered pit they had left behind them he wondered again and again what its purpose might be he compared perceptions and arrived at judgments he compared judgments reaching conclusions not always correct ones it is true but at least he used his brain for the purpose god intended it which was the less difficult because he was not handicapped by the second hand and usually erroneous judgment of others and as he puzzled over the covered pit there loomed suddenly before his mental vision a huge gray black bulk which lumbered ponderously along a jungle trail instantly tarzan tensed to the shock of a sudden fear decision and action usually occurred simultaneously in the life of the ape man and now he was away through the leafy branches ere the realization of the pit's purpose had scarce formed in his mind swinging from swaying limb to swaying limb he raced through the middle terraces where the trees grew close together again he dropped to the ground and sped silently and light of foot over the carpet of decaying vegetation only to leap again into the trees where the tangled undergrowth precluded rapid advance upon the surface in his anxiety he cast discretion to the winds the caution of the beast was lost in the loyalty of the man and so it came that he entered a large clearing denuded of trees without a thought of what might lie there or upon the farther edge to dispute the way with him he was half way across when directly in his path and but a few yards away there rose from a clump of tall grasses a half dozen chattering birds instantly tarzan turned aside for he knew well enough what manner of creature the presence of these little sentinels proclaimed simultaneously buto the rhinoceros scrambled to his short legs and charged furiously haphazard charges buto the rhinoceros with his weak eyes he sees but poorly even at short distances and whether his erratic rushes are due to the panic of fear as he attempts to escape or to the irascible temper with which he is generally credited it is difficult to determine nor is the matter of little moment to one whom buto charges for if he be caught and tossed the chances are that naught will interest him thereafter and today it chanced that buto bore down straight upon tarzan across the few yards of knee deep grass which separated them accident started him in the direction of the ape man and then his weak eyes discerned the enemy and with a series of snorts he charged straight for him the little rhino birds fluttered and circled about their giant ward among the branches of the trees at the edge of the clearing a score or more monkeys chattered and scolded as the loud snorts of the angry beast sent them scurrying affrightedly to the upper terraces tarzan alone appeared indifferent and serene directly in the path of the charge he stood there had been no time to seek safety in the trees beyond the clearing nor had tarzan any mind to delay his journey because of buto he had met the stupid beast before and held him in fine contempt and now buto was upon him the massive head lowered and the long heavy horn inclined for the frightful work for which nature had designed it but as he struck upward his weapon raked only thin air for the ape man had sprung lightly aloft with a catlike leap that carried him above the threatening horn to the broad back of the rhinoceros another spring and he was on the ground behind the brute and racing like a deer for the trees buto angered and mystified by the strange disappearance of his prey wheeled and charged frantically in another direction which chanced to be not the direction of tarzan's flight and so the ape man came in safety to the trees and continued on his swift way through the forest some distance ahead of him tantor moved steadily along the well worn elephant trail and ahead of tantor a crouching black warrior listened intently in the middle of the path presently he heard the sound for which he had been hoping the cracking snapping sound which heralded the approach of an elephant to his right and left in other parts of the jungle other warriors were watching a low signal passed from one to another apprised the most distant that the quarry was afoot rapidly they converged toward the trail taking positions in trees down wind from the point at which tantor must pass them silently they waited and presently were rewarded by the sight of a mighty tusker carrying an amount of ivory in his long tusks that set their greedy hearts to palpitating no sooner had he passed their positions than the warriors clambered from their perches no longer were they silent but instead clapped their hands and shouted as they reached the ground for an instant tantor the elephant paused with upraised trunk and tail with great ears up pricked and then he swung on along the trail at a rapid shuffling pace straight toward the covered pit with its sharpened stakes upstanding in the ground behind him came the yelling warriors urging him on in the rapid flight which would not permit a careful examination of the ground before him tantor the elephant who could have turned and scattered his adversaries with a single charge fled like a frightened deer fled toward a hideous torturing death and behind them all came tarzan of the apes racing through the jungle forest with the speed and agility of a squirrel for he had heard the shouts of the warriors and had interpreted them correctly once he uttered a piercing call that reverberated through the jungle but tantor in the panic of terror either failed to hear or hearing dared not pause to heed now the giant pachyderm was but a few yards from the hidden death lurking in his path and the blacks certain of success were screaming and dancing in his wake waving their war spears and celebrating in advance the acquisition of the splendid ivory carried by their prey and the surfeit of elephant meat which would be theirs this night so intent were they upon their gratulations that they entirely failed to note the silent passage of the man beast above their heads nor did tantor either see or hear him even though tarzan called to him to stop a few more steps would precipitate tantor upon the sharpened stakes tarzan fairly flew through the trees until he had come abreast of the fleeing animal and then had passed him at the pit's verge the ape man dropped to the ground in the center of the trail tantor was almost upon him before his weak eyes permitted him to recognize his old friend stop cried tarzan and the great beast halted to the upraised hand tarzan turned and kicked aside some of the brush which hid the pit instantly tantor saw and understood fight growled tarzan they are coming behind you but tantor the elephant is a huge bunch of nerves and now he was half panic stricken by terror before him yawned the pit how far he did not know but to right and left lay the primeval jungle untouched by man with a squeal the great beast turned suddenly at right angles and burst his noisy way through the solid wall of matted vegetation that would have stopped any but him tarzan standing upon the edge of the pit smiled as he watched tantor's undignified flight soon the blacks would come it was best that tarzan of the apes faded from the scene he essayed a step from the pit's edge and as he threw the weight of his body upon his left foot the earth crumbled away tarzan made a single herculean effort to throw himself forward but it was too late backward and downward he went toward the sharpened stakes in the bottom of the pit when a moment later the blacks came they saw even from a distance that tantor had eluded them for the size of the hole in the pit covering was too small to have accommodated the huge bulk of an elephant at first"
