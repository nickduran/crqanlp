"1" "jack between his feet against the rolling of the boat wilbur looked fearfully at the mess in the pan recalling the chocolate and stuffed olives that had been his last luncheon well he muttered clinching his teeth i've got to come to it sooner or later his penknife was in the pocket of his waist coat underneath his oilskin coat he opened the big blade harpooned a cube of pork and deposited it on his tin plate he ate it slowly and with savage determination but the black jack was more than he could bear i'm not hungry enough for that just now he told himself say jim he said turning to the chinaman next him on the bunk ledge say what kind of boat is this what you do where you go the other moved away impatiently no sabe no sabe he answered shaking his head and frowning throughout the whole of that strange meal these were the only words spoken when wilbur came on deck again he noted that the bertha millner had already left the whistling buoy astern off to the east her sails just showing above the waves was a pilot boat with the number 7 on her mainsail the evening was closing in the farallones were in plain sight dead ahead far behind in a mass of shadow just bluer than the sky he could make out a few twinkling lights san francisco half an hour later kitchell came on deck from his supper in the cabin aft he glanced in the direction of the mainland now almost out of sight then took the wheel from one of the chinamen and commanded ease off y'r fore an main sheets the hands eased away and the schooner played off before the wind the staysail was set the bertha millner headed to southwest bowling easily ahead of a good eight knot breeze next came the order all hands aft and wilbur and his mates betook themselves to the quarterdeck charlie took the wheel and he and kitchell began to choose the men for their watches just as wilbur remembered to have chosen sides for baseball during his school days sonny i'll choose you you're on my watch said the captain to wilbur and i will assoom the ree sponsibility of your nautical eddoocation i may as well tell you at once began wilbur that i'm no sailor but you will be soon answered the captain at once soothing and threatening you will be mister lilee of the vallee you kin lay to it as how you will be one of the best sailormen along the front as our dear friend jim says before i git throo with you you'll be a sailorman or shark bait i can promise you you're on my watch step over here son the watches were divided charlie and three other chinamen on the port kitchell wilbur and two chinamen on the starboard the men trooped forward again the tiny world of the schooner had lapsed to quiet the bertha millner was now clear of the land that lay like a blur of faintest purple smoke ever growing fainter low in the east the farallones showed but their shoulders above the horizon the schooner was standing well out from shore even beyond the track of the coasters and passenger steamers to catch the trades from the northwest the sun was setting royally and the floor of the ocean shimmered like mosaic the sea had gone down and the fury of the bar was a thing forgotten it was perceptibly warmer on board the two watches mingled forward smoking opium and playing a game that looked like checkers three of them were washing down the decks with kaiar brooms for the first time since he had come on board wilbur heard the sound of their voices the evening was magnificent never to wilbur's eyes had the pacific appeared so vast so radiant so divinely beautiful a star or two burned slowly through that part of the sky where the pink began to fade into the blue charlie went forward and set the side lights red on the port rigging green on the starboard as he passed wilbur who was leaning over the rail and watching the phosphorus flashing just under the surface he said hey you go talkee talk one piecey boss savvy boss chin chin wilbur went aft and came up on the poop where kitchell stood at the wheel smoking an inverted tarrier's delight now son began kitchell i natch'ly love you so that i'm goin to do you a reel favor do you twig i'm goin to allow you to berth aft in the cabin long o me an charlie an beesides you can make free of my quarterdeck mebbee you ain't used to the ways of sailormen just yet but you can lay to it that those two are reel concessions savvy i ain't a mush head like mee dear friend jim you ain't no water front swine i can guess that with one hand tied beehind me you're a toff that's what you are and your lines has been laid for toffs i ain't askin you no

this cruise as easy as how do you do you don't an i'll manhandle you till y'r bones come throo y'r hide i've no choice in the matter said wilbur i've got to make the best of a bad situation i ree marked as how you had brains muttered the captain but there's one thing continued wilbur if i'm to have my head a little as you say you'll find we can get along better if you put me to rights about this whole business why was i brought aboard why are there only chinese along where are we going what are we going to do and how long are we going to be gone kitchell spat over the side and then sucked the nicotine from his mustache well he said resuming his pipe it's like this son this ship belongs to one of the six chinese companies of chinatown in frisco charlie here is one of the shareholders in the business we go down here twice a year off cape sain lucas lower california an fish for blue sharks or white if we kin ketch em we get the livers of these an try out the oil an we bring back that same oil an the chinamen sell it all over san francisco as simon pure cod liver oil savvy an it pays like a nitrate bed i come in because it's a custom house regulation that no coolie can take a boat out of frisco and how do i come in asked wilbur mee dear friend jim put a knock me out drop into your manhattan cocktail it's a capsule filled with a drug you were shanghaied son said the captain blandly about an hour later wilbur turned in kitchell showed him his bunk with its donkey's breakfast and single ill smelling blanket it was located under the companionway that led down into the cabin kitchell bunked on one side charlie on the other a hacked deal table covered with oilcloth and ironed to the floor a swinging lamp two chairs a rack of books a chest or two and a flaring picture cut from the advertisement of a ballet was the room's inventory in the matter of furniture and ornament wilbur sat on the edge of his bunk before undressing reviewing the extraordinary events of the day in a moment he was aware of a movement in one of the other two bunks and presently made out charlie lying on his side and holding in the flame of an alcohol lamp a skewer on which some brown and sticky stuff boiled and sizzled he transformed the stuff to the bowl of a huge pipe and drew on it noisily once or twice in another moment he had sunk back in his bunk nearly senseless but with a long breath of an almost blissful contentment beast muttered wilbur with profound disgust he threw off his oilskin coat and felt in the pocket of his waistcoat which he had retained when he had changed his clothes in the fo'c'sle for his watch he drew it out it was just nine o'clock all at once an idea occurred to him he fumbled in another pocket of the waistcoat and brought out one of his calling cards for a moment wilbur remained motionless seated on the bunk ledge smiling grimly while his glance wandered now to the sordid cabin of the bertha millner and the opium drugged coolie sprawled on the donkey's breakfast and now to the card in his hand on which a few hours ago he had written first waltz jo iii the lady letty another day passed then two before wilbur knew it he had settled himself to his new life and woke one morning to the realization that he was positively enjoying himself daily the weather grew warmer the fifth day out from san francisco it was actually hot the pitch grew soft in the bertha millner's deck seams the masts sweated resin the chinamen went about the decks wearing but their jeans and blouses kitchell had long since abandoned his coat and vest wilbur's oilskins became intolerable and he was at last constrained to trade his pocket knife to charlie for a suit of jeans and wicker sandals such as the coolies wore and odd enough he looked in them the captain instructed him in steering and even promised to show him the use of the sextant and how to take an observation in the fake short and easy coasting style of navigation furthermore he showed him how to read the log and the manner of keeping the dead reckoning during most of his watches wilbur was engaged in painting the inside of the cabin door panels lintels and the few scattered moldings and toward the middle of the first week out when the bertha millner was in the latitude of point conception he and three chinamen under kitchell's directions ratlined down the forerigging and affixed the crow's nest upon the for'mast the next morning during charlie's watch on deck a chinaman was sent up into the crow's nest and from that time on there was always a lookout maintained from the masthead more than once wilbur looked around him at the empty coruscating indigo of the ocean floor wondering at the necessity of the lookout and finally expressed his curiosity to kitchell the captain had now taken not a little to wilbur at first for the sake of a white man's company and afterward because he began to place a certain vague reliance upon wilbur's judgment kitchell had reemarked as how he had brains well you see son kitchell had explained to wilbur os tensiblee we are after shark liver oil and so we are but also we are on any lay that turns up ready for any game from wrecking to barratry strike me if i haven't thought of scuttling the dough dish for her insoorance there's regular trade son to be done in ships and then there's pickin's an pickin's an pickin's lord the ocean's rich with pickin's do you know there's millions made out of the day bree and refuse of a big city how about an ocean's day bree just chew on that notion a turn an as fur a lookout lemmee tell you son cast your eye out yon and he swept the sea with a forearm nothin hey so it looks but lemmee tell you son there ain't no manner of place on the ball of dirt where you're likely to run up afoul of so many things unexpected things as at sea when you're clear o land lay to this here pree cep a million to one on the unexpected the next day fell almost dead calm the hale lusty lunged nor'wester that had snorted them forth from the golden gate had lapsed to a zephyr the schooner rolled lazily southward with the leisurely nonchalance of a grazing ox at noon just after dinner a few cat's paws curdled the milky blue whiteness of the glassy surface and the water once more began to talk beneath the bow sprit it was very hot the sun spun silently like a spinning brass discus over the mainmast on the fo'c'sle head the chinamen were asleep or smoking opium it was charlie's watch kitchell dozed in his hammock in the shadow of the mainsheet wilbur was below tinkering with his paint pot about the cabin the stillness was profound it was the stillness of the summer sea at high noon the lookout in the crow's nest broke the quiet hy yah hy yah he cried leaning from the barrel and calling through an arched palm hy yah one two plenty many tortle topside wattah hy yah all same tortle hello hello cried the captain rolling from his hammock turtle where away i tink um bout quallah mile mebbee four piecee tortle all same weatha bow turtle hey down y'r wheel jim haul y'r jib to win'ward he commanded the man at the wheel then to the men forward get the dory overboard son charlie and you wing tumble in wake up now and see you stay so the dory was swung over the side and the men dropped into her and took their places at the oars give way cried the captain settling himself in the bow with the gaff in his hand hey jim he shouted to the lookout far above hey lay our course for us the lookout nodded the oars fell and the dory shot forward in the direction indicated by the lookout kin you row son asked kitchell with sudden suspicion wilbur smiled you ask charlie and wing to ship their oars and give me a pair the captain complied hesitating now what he said grimly now what do you think you're going to do sonny i'm going to show you the bob cook stroke we used in our boat in 95 when we beat harvard answered wilbur kitchell gazed doubtfully at the first few strokes then with growing interest watched the tremendous reach the powerful knee drive the swing the easy catch and the perfect recover the dory was cutting the water like a gasoline launch and between strokes there was the least possible diminishing of the speed i'm a bit out of form just now remarked wilbur and i'm used to the sliding seat but i guess it'll do kitchell glanced at the human machine that once was no 5 in the yale boat and then at the water hissing from the dory's bows my gawd he said under his breath he spat over the bows and sucked the nicotine from his mustache thoughtfully i ree marked he observed as how you had brains my son a few minutes later the captain who was standing in the dory's bow and alternately conning the ocean's surface and looking back to the chinaman standing on the schooner's masthead uttered an exclamation steady ship your oars quiet now quiet you damn fools we're right on em four by gawd an big as dinin tables the oars were shipped the dory's speed dwindled out your paddles sit on the gun'l and paddle ee asy the hands obeyed the captain's voice dropped to a whisper his back was toward them and he gestured with one free hand looking out over the water from his seat on the gun'l wilbur could make out a round greenish mass like a patch of floating seaweed just under the surface some sixty yards ahead easy sta'board whispered the captain under his elbow go ahead port e e easy all steady steady the affair began to assume the intensity of a little drama a little drama of midocean in spite of himself wilbur was excited he even found occasion to observe that the life was not so bad after all this was as good fun as stalking deer the dory moved forward by inches kitchell's whisper was as faint as a dying infant's steady all s stead ee sh stead he lunged forward sharply with the gaff and shouted aloud i got him grab holt his tail flippers you fool swabs grab holt quick don't you leggo got him there charlie if he gets away you swine i'll rip y open with the gaff heave now heave there there soh stand clear his nippers strike me he's a whacker i thought he was going to get away saw me just as i swung the gaff an ducked his nut over the side bundled without ceremony into the boat clawing thrashing clattering and blowing like the exhaust of a donkey engine tumbled the great green turtle his wet green shield of shell three feet from edge to edge the gaff firmly transfixed in his body just under the fore flipper from under his shell protruded his snake like head and neck withered like that of an old man he was waving his head from side to side the jaws snapping like a snapped silk handkerchief kitchell thrust him away with a paddle the turtle craned his neck and catching the bit of wood in his jaw bit it in two in a single grip i tol you so i tol you to stand clear his snapper if that had been your shin now eh hello what's that faintly across the water came a prolonged hallooing from the schooner kitchell stood up in the dory shading his eyes with his hat what's biting em now he muttered with the uneasiness of a captain away from his ship oughta left charlie on board or you son who's doin that yellin i can't make out up in the crow's nest exclaimed wilbur it's jim see he's waving his arms well whaduz he wave his dam fool arms for growled kitchell angry because something was going forward he did not understand there he's shouting again listen i can't make out what he's yelling he'll yell to a different pipe when i get my grip of him i'll twist the head of that swab till he'll have to walk back'ard to see where he's goin whaduz he wave his arms for whaduz he yell like a dam philly loo bird for what's him say charlie jim heap sing no can tell mebbee tinkum sing come back chop chop we'll see oars out men give way now son put a little o that yale stingo in the stroke in the crow's nest jim still yelled and waved like one distraught while the dory returned at a smart clip toward the schooner kitchell lathered with fury oh h he murmured softly through his gritted teeth jess lemmee lay mee two hands afoul of you wunst you gibbering yellow philly loo bird believe me you'll dance shut up he roared shut up you crazy do do ain't we coming fast as we can the dory bumped alongside and the captain was over the rail like quicksilver the hands were all in the bow looking and pointing to the west jim slid down the ratlines bubbling over with suppressed news before his feet had touched the deck kitchell had kicked him into the stays again fulminating blasphemies sing he shouted as the chinaman clambered away like a bewildered ape sing a little more i would if i were you why don't you sing and wave you dam fool philly loo bird yas sah answered the coolie what you yell for charlie ask him whaffo him sing i tink um ship answered charlie calmly looking out over the starboard quarter ship him velly sick hazarded the chinaman from the ratlines adding a sentence in chinese to charlie he says he tink um ship sick all same ask um something ship velly sick by this time the captain wilbur and all on board could plainly make out a sail some eight miles off the starboard bow even at that distance and to eyes so inexperienced as those of wilbur it needed but a glance to know that something was wrong with her it was not that she failed to ride the waves with even keel it was not that her rigging was in disarray nor that her sails were disordered her distance was too great to make out such details but in precisely the same manner as a trained physician glances at a doomed patient and from that indefinable look in the face of him and the eyes of him pronounces the verdict death so kitchell took in the stranger with a single comprehensive glance and exclaimed wreck yas sah i tink um velly sick oh go to ll or go below and fetch up my glass hustle the glass was brought son exclaimed kitchell where is that man with the brains son come aloft here with me the two clambered up the ratlines to the crow's nest kitchell adjusted the glass she's a bark he muttered iron built about seven hundred tons i guess in distress there's her ensign upside down at the mizz'nhead looks like norway an her distress signals on the spanker gaff take a blink at her son what do you make her out lord she's ridin high wilbur took the glass catching the stranger after several clumsy attempts she was as captain kitchell had announced a bark and to judge by her flag evidently norwegian how she rolls muttered wilbur that's what i can't make out answered kitchell a bark such as she ain't ought to roll thata way her ballast'd steady her what's the flags on that boom aft one's red and white and square shaped and the other's the same color only swallow tail in shape that's h b meanin i am in need of assistance well where's the crew i don't see anybody on board oh they're there right enough then they're pretty well concealed about the premises turned wilbur as he passed the glass to the captain she does seem kinda empty said the captain in a moment with a sudden show of interest that wilbur failed to understand an where's her boats continued kitchell i don't just quite make out any boats at all there was a long silence seems to be a sort of haze over her observed wilbur i noticed that air kinda quivers oily like no boats no boats an i can't see anybody aboard suddenly kitchell lowered the glass and turned to wilbur he was a different man there was a new shine in his eyes a wicked line appeared over the nose the jaw grew salient prognathous son he exclaimed gimleting wilbur with his contracted eyes i have reemarked as how you had brains i kin fool the coolies but i can't fool you it looks to me as if that bark yonder was a derelict an do you know what that means to us chaw on it a turn a derelict if there's a crew on board they're concealed from the public gaze an where are the boats then i figger she's an abandoned derelict do you know what that means for us for you and i it means and gripping wilbur by the shoulders he spoke the word into his face with a savage intensity it means salvage do you savvy salvage salvage do you figger what salvage on a seven hundred tonner would come to well just lemmee drop it into your think tank an lay to what i say it's all the ways from fifty to seventy thousand dollars whatever her cargo is call it sixty thousand thirty thou apiece oh i don't know he exclaimed lapsing to landman's slang wha'd i say about a million to one on the unexpected at sea thirty thousand exclaimed wilbur without thought as yet now y'r singin songs cried the captain listen to me son he went on rapidly shutting up the glass and thrusting it back in the case my name's kitchell and i'm hog right through he emphasized the words with a leveled forefinger his eyes flashing h o g spells very truly yours alvinza kitchell ninety nine swine an me make a hundred swine i'm a shoat with both feet in the trough first last an always if that bark's abandoned an i says she is she's ours i'm out for anything that there's stuff in i guess i'm more of a beach comber by nature than anything else if she's abandoned she belongs to us to ll with this coolie game we'll go beach combin you and i we'll board that bark and work her into the nearest port san diego i guess and get the salvage on her if we have to swim in her are you with me he held out his hand the man was positively trembling from head to heel it was impossible to resist the excitement of the situation its novelty the high crow's nest of the schooner the keen salt air the chinamen grouped far below the indigo of the warm ocean and out yonder the forsaken derelict rolling her light hull till the garboard streak flashed in the sun well of course i'm with you cap exclaimed wilbur gripping kitchell's hand when there's thirty thousand to be had for the asking i guess i'm a na'chel bawn beach comber myself now nothing about this to the coolies but how will you make out with your owners the six companies aren't you bound to bring the bertha in rot my owners exclaimed kitchell i ain't a skipper of no oil boat any longer i'm a beach comber he fixed the wallowing bark with glistening eyes gawd strike me he murmured ain't she a daisy it's a little klondike come on son the two went down the ratlines and kitchell ordered a couple of the hands into the dory that had been rowing astern he and wilbur followed charlie was left on board with directions to lay the schooner to the dory flew over the water wilbur setting the stroke in a few moments she was well up with the bark though a larger boat than the bertha millner she was rolling in lamentable fashion and every laboring heave showed her bottom incrusted with barnacles and seaweed her fore and main tops'ls and to'gallants'ls were set as also were her lower stays'ls and royals but the braces seemed to have parted and the yards were swinging back and forth in their ties the spanker was brailed up and the spanker boom thrashed idly over the poop as the bark rolled and rolled and rolled the mainmast was working in its shoe the rigging and backstays sagged an air of abandonment of unspeakable loneliness of abomination hung about her never had wilbur seen anything more utterly alone within three lengths the captain rose in his place and shouted bark ahoy there was no answer thrice he repeated the call and thrice the dismal thrashing of the spanker boom and the flapping of the sails was the only answer kitchell turned to wilbur in triumph i guess she's ours he whispered they were now close enough to make out the bark's name upon her counter lady letty and wilbur was in the act of reading it aloud when a huge brown dorsal fin like the triangular sail of a lugger cut the water between the dory and the bark shark said kitchell and there's another he exclaimed in the next instant and another strike me the water's alive with em there's a stiff on the bark you can lay to that and at that acting on some strange impulse he called again bark ahoy there was no response the dory was now well up to the derelict and pretty soon a prolonged and vibratory hissing noise strident insistent smote upon their ears what's that exclaimed wilbur perplexed the captain shook his head and just then as the bark rolled almost to her scuppers in their direction a glimpse of the deck was presented to their view it was only a glimpse gone on the instant as the bark rolled back to port but it was time enough for wilbur and the captain to note the parted and open seams and the deck bulging and in one corner blown up and splintered the captain smote a thigh coal he cried anthracite coal the coal he't up and generated gas of course no fire y'understand just gas gas blew up the deck no way of stopping combustion naturally they had to cut for it smell the gas can't you no wonder she's hissing no wonder she rolled cargo goes off in gas and what's to weigh her down i was wondering what could a wrecked her in this weather lord it's as plain as billy b'damn the dory was alongside kitchell watched his chance and as the bark rolled down caught the mainyard brace hanging in a bight over the rail and swung himself to the deck look sharp he called as wilbur followed it won't do for you to fall among them shark son just look at the hundreds of em there's a stiff on board sure wilbur steadied himself on the swaying broken deck choking against the reek of coal gas that"
