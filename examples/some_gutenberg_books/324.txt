"1" "claiming the right undisputed because they were the only two places in the county where there was enough level land for the court house to stand on let no man think this a trivial issue there had been a similar one over on the virginia side once and the opposing factions agreed to decide the question by the ancient wager of battle fist and skull two hundred men on each side and the women of the county with difficulty prevented the fight just now mr budd was on his way to the pocket the voting place of one faction where he had never been where the hostility against him was most bitter and that day he knew he was up against waterloo the crossing of the rubicon holding the pass at thermopylae or any other historical crisis in the history of man i was saddling the mules when the cackling of geese in the creek announced the coming of the hon samuel budd coming with his chin on his breast deep in thought still his eyes beamed cheerily he lifted his slouched hat gallantly to the blight and the little sister and he would wait for us to jog along with him i told him of our troubles meanwhile the wild dog had restored our mules and the hon sam beamed he's a wonder where is he he never waited even for thanks again the hon sam beamed ah just like him he's gone ahead to help me well how did he happen to be here i asked he's everywhere said the hon sam how did he know the mules were ours easy that boy knows everything well why did he bring them back and then leave so mysteriously the hon sam silently pointed a finger at the laughing blight ahead and i looked incredulous just the same that's another reason i told you to warn marston he's already got it in his head that marston is his rival pshaw i said for it was too ridiculous all right said the hon sam placidly then why doesn't he want to see her how do you know he ain't watchin her now for all we know mark me he added you won't see him at the speakin but i'll bet fruit cake agin gingerbread he'll be somewhere around so we went on the two girls leading the way and the hon sam now telling his political troubles to me half a mile down the road a solitary horseman stood waiting and mr budd gave a low whistle one o my rivals he said from the corner of his mouth mornin said the horseman lemme see you a minute he made a movement to draw aside but the hon samuel made a counter gesture of dissent this gentleman is a friend of mine he said firmly but with great courtesy and he can hear what you have to say to me the mountaineer rubbed one huge hand over his stubbly chin threw one of his long legs over the pommel of his saddle and dangled a heavy cowhide shoe to and fro would you mind tellin me whut pay a member of the house of legislatur gits a day the hon sam looked surprised i think about two dollars and a half an his meals no laughed mr budd well look ee here stranger i'm a pore man an i've got a mortgage on my farm that money don't mean nothin to you but if you'll draw out now an i win i'll tell ye whut i'll do he paused as though to make sure that the sacrifice was possible i'll just give ye half of that two dollars and a half a day as shore as you're a settin on that hoss and you won't hav to hit a durn lick to earn it i had not the heart to smile nor did the hon samuel so artless and simple was the man and so pathetic his appeal you see you'll divide my vote an ef we both run ole josh barton'll git it shore ef you git out o the way i can lick him easy mr budd's answer was kind instructive and uplifted my friend said he i'm sorry but i cannot possibly accede to your request for the following reasons first it would not be fair to my constituents secondly it would hardly be seeming to barter the noble gift of the people to which we both aspire thirdly you might lose with me out of the way and fourthly i'm going to win whether you are in the way or not the horseman slowly collapsed while the hon samuel was talking and now he threw the leg back kicked for his stirrup twice spat once and turned his horse's head i reckon you will stranger he said sadly with that gift o gab o yourn he turned without another word or nod of good by and started back up the creek whence he had come one gone said the hon samuel budd grimly and i swear i'm right sorry for him and so was i an hour later we struck the river and another hour upstream brought us to where the contest of tongues was to come about no sylvan dell in arcady could have been lovelier than the spot above the road a big spring poured a clear little stream over shining pebbles into the river above it the bushes hung thick with autumn leaves and above them stood yellow beeches like pillars of pale fire on both sides of the road sat and squatted the honest voters sour looking disgruntled a distinctly hostile crowd the blight and my little sister drew great and curious attention as they sat on a bowlder above the spring while i went with the hon samuel budd under the guidance of uncle tommie hendricks who introduced him right and left the hon samuel was cheery but he was plainly nervous there were two lanky youths whose names oddly enough were budd as they gave him their huge paws in lifeless fashion the hon samuel slapped one on the shoulder with the true democracy of the politician and said jocosely well we budds may not be what you call great people but thank god none of us have ever been in the penitentiary and he laughed loudly thinking that he had scored a great and jolly point the two young men looked exceedingly grave and uncle tommie panic stricken he plucked the hon sam by the sleeve and led him aside i reckon you made a leetle mistake thar them two fellers daddy died in the penitentiary last spring the hon sam whistled mournfully but he looked game enough when his opponent rose to speak uncle josh barton who had short thick upright hair little sharp eyes and a rasping voice uncle josh wasted no time feller citizens he shouted this man is a lawyer he's a corporation lawyer the fearful name pronounced lie yer rang through the crowd like a trumpet and like lightning the hon sam was on his feet the man who says that is a liar he said calmly and i demand your authority for the statement if you won't give it i shall hold you personally responsible sir it was a strike home and under the flashing eyes that stared unwaveringly through the big goggles uncle josh halted and stammered and admitted that he might have been misinformed then i advise you to be more careful cautioned the hon samuel sharply feller citizens said uncle josh if he ain't a corporation lawyer who is this man where did he come from i have been born and raised among you you all know me do you know him whut's he a doin now he's a fine haired furriner an he's come down hyeh from the settlemints to tell ye that you hain't got no man in yo own deestrict that's fittin to represent ye in the legislatur look at him look at him he's got four eyes look at his hair hit's parted in the middle there was a storm of laughter uncle josh had made good and if the hon samuel could straightway have turned bald headed and sightless he would have been a happy man he looked sick with hopelessness but uncle tommie hendricks his mentor was vigorously whispering something in his ear and gradually his face cleared indeed the hon samuel was smilingly confident when he rose like his rival he stood in the open road and the sun beat down on his parted yellow hair so that the eyes of all could see and the laughter was still running round who is your uncle josh he asked with threatening mildness i know i was not born here but my friends i couldn't help that and just as soon as i could get away from where i was born i came here and he paused with lips parted and long finger outstretched and i came because i wanted to come and not because i had to now it seems that uncle josh too was not a native and that he had left home early in life for his state's good and for his own uncle tommie had whispered this and the hon samuel raised himself high on both toes while the expectant crowd on the verge of a roar waited as did uncle joshua with a sickly smile why did your uncle josh come among you because he was hoop poled away from home then came the roar and the hon samuel had to quell it with uplifted hand and did your uncle joshua marry a mountain wife no i he didn't think any of your mountain women were good enough for him so he slips down into the settlemints and steals one and now fellow citizens that is just what i'm here for i'm looking for a nice mountain girl and i'm going to have her again the hon samuel had to still the roar and then he went on quietly to show how they must lose the court house site if they did not send him to the legislature and how while they might not get it if they did send him it was their only hope to send only him the crowd had grown somewhat hostile again and it was after one telling period when the hon samuel stopped to mop his brow that a gigantic mountaineer rose in the rear of the crowd talk on stranger you're talking sense i'll trust ye you've got big ears now the hon samuel possessed a primordial talent that is rather rare in these physically degenerate days he said nothing but stood quietly in the middle of the road the eyes of the crowd on either side of the road began to bulge the lips of all opened with wonder and a simultaneous burst of laughter rose around the hon samuel budd a dozen men sprang to their feet and rushed up to him looking at those remarkable ears as they gravely wagged to and fro that settled things and as we left the hon sam was having things his own way and on the edge of the crowd uncle tommie hendricks was shaking his head i tell ye boys he ain't no jackass even if he can flop his ears at the river we started upstream and some impulse made me turn in my saddle and look back all the time i had had an eye open for the young mountaineer whose interest in us seemed to be so keen and now i saw standing at the head of a gray horse on the edge of the crowd a tall figure with his hands on his hips and looking after us i couldn't be sure but it looked like the wild dog iv close quarters two hours up the river we struck buck buck was sitting on the fence by the roadside barefooted and hatless how dye do i said purty well said buck any fish in this river several said buck now in mountain speech several means simply a good many any minnows in these branches i seed several in the branch back o our house how far away do you live oh bout one whoop an a holler if he had spoken greek the blight could not have been more puzzled he meant he lived as far as a man's voice would carry with one yell and a holla will you help me catch some buck nodded all right i said turning my horse up to the fence get on behind the horse shied his hind quarters away and i pulled him back now you can get on if you'll be quick buck sat still yes he said imperturbably but i ain't quick the two girls laughed aloud and buck looked surprised around a curving cornfield we went and through a meadow which buck said was a nigh cut from the limb of a tree that we passed hung a piece of wire with an iron ring swinging at its upturned end a little farther was another tree and another ring and farther on another and another for heaven's sake buck what are these things mart's a gittin ready fer a tourneyment a what that's whut mart calls hit he was over to the gap last fourth o july an he says fellers over thar fix up like kuklux and go a chargin on hosses and takin off them rings with a ash stick spear mart calls hit he come back an he says he's a goin to win that ar tourneyment next fourth o july he's got the best hoss up this river and on sundays him an dave branham goes a chargin along here a picking off these rings jus a flyin an mart can do hit i'm tellin ye dave's mighty good hisself but he ain't nowhar longside o mart this was strange i had told the blight about our fourth of july and how on the virginia side the ancient custom of the tournament still survived it was on the last fourth of july that she had meant to come to the gap truly civilization was spreading throughout the hills who's mart mart's my brother said little buck he was over to the gap not long ago an he come back mad as hops he stopped suddenly and in such a way that i turned my head knowing that caution had caught buck what about oh nothin said buck carelessly only he's been quar ever since my sisters says he's got a gal over thar an he's a pickin off these rings more'n ever now he's going to win or bust a belly band well who's dave branham buck grinned you jes axe my sister mollie thar she is before us was a white framed house of logs in the porch of which stood two stalwart good looking girls could we stay all night we could there was no hesitation and straight in we rode where's your father both girls giggled and one said with frank unembarrassment pap's tight that did not look promising but we had to stay just the same buck helped me to unhitch the mules helped me also to catch minnows and in half an hour we started down the river to try fishing before dark came buck trotted along have you got a wagon buck what fer to bring the fish back buck was not to be caught napping we got that sled thar but hit won't be big enough he said gravely an our two hoss wagon's out in the cornfield we'll have to string the fish leave em in the river and go fer em in the mornin all right buck the blight was greatly amused at buck two hundred yards down the road stood his sisters over the figure of a man outstretched in the road unashamed they smiled at us the man in the road was pap tight and they were trying to get him home we cast into a dark pool farther down and fished most patiently not a bite not a nibble are there any fish in here buck dunno used ter be the shadows deepened we must go back to the house is there a dam below here buck yes thar's a dam about a half mile down the river i was disgusted no wonder there were no bass in that pool why didn't you tell me that before you never axed me said buck placidly i began winding in my line ain't no bottom to that pool said buck now i never saw any rural community where there was not a bottomless pool and i suddenly determined to shake one tradition in at least one community so i took an extra fish line tied a stone to it and climbed into a canoe buck watching me but not asking a word get in buck silently he got in and i pushed off to the centre this the deepest part buck i reckon so i dropped in the stone and the line reeled out some fifty feet and began to coil on the surface of the water i guess that's on the bottom isn't it buck buck looked genuinely distressed but presently he brightened yes he said ef hit ain't on a turtle's back literally i threw up both hands and back we trailed fishless reckon you won't need that two hoss wagon said buck no buck i think not buck looked at the blight and gave himself the pleasure of his first chuckle a big crackling cheerful fire awaited us through the door i could see outstretched on a bed in the next room the limp figure of pap in alcoholic sleep the old mother big kind faced explained and there was a heaven of kindness and charity in her drawling voice dad didn often git that a way she said but he'd been out a huntin hawgs that mornin and had met up with some teamsters and gone to a political speakin and had tuk a dram or two of their mean whiskey and not havin nothin on his stummick hit had all gone to his head no pap didn't git that a way often and he'd be all right jes as soon as he slept it off a while the old woman moved about with a cane and the sympathetic blight merely looked a question at her yes she'd fell down a year ago and had sort o hurt herself didn't do nothin though cept break one hip she added in her kind patient old voice did many people stop there oh yes sometimes fifteen at a time they never turned nobody away and she had a big family little cindy and the two big girls and buck and mart who was out somewhere and the hired man and yes thar was another boy but he was fitified said one of the big sisters i beg your pardon said the wondering blight but she knew that phrase wouldn't do so she added politely what did you say fitified tom has fits he's in a asylum in the settlements tom come back once an he was all right said the old mother but he worried so much over them gals workin so hard that it plum throwed him off ag'in and we had to send him back do you work pretty hard i asked presently then a story came that was full of unconscious pathos because there was no hint of complaint simply a plain statement of daily life they got up before the men in order to get breakfast ready then they went with the men into the fields those two girls and worked like men at dark they got supper ready and after the men went to bed they worked on washing dishes and clearing up the kitchen they took it turn about getting supper and sometimes one said she was so plumb tuckered out that she'd drap on the bed and go to sleep ruther than eat her own supper no wonder poor tom had to go back to the asylum all the while the two girls stood by the fire looking politely but minutely at the two strange girls and their curious clothes and their boots and the way they dressed their hair their hard life seemed to have hurt them none for both were the pictures of health whatever that phrase means after supper pap came in perfectly sober with a big ruddy face giant frame and twinkling gray eyes he was the man who had risen to speak his faith in the hon samuel budd that day on the size of the hon samuel's ears he too was unashamed and as he explained his plight again he did it with little apology i seed ye at the speakin to day that man budd is a good man he done somethin fer a boy o mine over at the gap like little buck he too stopped short he's a good man an i'm a goin to help him yes he repeated quite irrelevantly it was hunting hogs all day with nothing to eat and only mean whiskey to drink mart had not come in yet he was workin out now he's the best worker in these mountains said the old woman mart works too hard the hired man appeared and joined us at the fire bedtime came and i whispered jokingly to the blight i believe i'll ask that good looking one to set up with me settin up is what courting is called in the hills the couple sit up in front of the fire after everybody else has gone to bed the man puts his arm around the girl's neck and whispers then she puts her arm around his neck and whispers so that the rest may not hear this i had related to the blight and now she withered me you just do now i turned to the girl in question whose name was mollie buck told me to ask you who dave branham was mollie wheeled blushing and angry but buck had darted cackling out the door oh i said and i changed the subject what time do you get up oh bout crack o day i was tired and that was discouraging do you get up that early every morning no was the quick answer a mornin later a morning later mollie got up each morning the blight laughed pretty soon the two girls were taken into the next room which was a long one with one bed in one dark corner one in the other and a third bed in the middle the feminine members of the family all followed them out on the porch and watched them brush their teeth for they had never seen tooth brushes before they watched them prepare for bed and i could hear much giggling and comment and many questions all of which culminated by and by in a chorus of shrieking laughter that climax as i learned next morning was over the blight's hot water bag never had their eyes rested on an article of more wonder and humor than that water bag by and by the feminine members came back and we sat around the fire still mart did not appear though somebody stepped into the kitchen and from the warning glance that mollie gave buck when she left the room i guessed that the newcomer was her lover dave pretty soon the old man yawned well mammy i reckon this stranger's about ready to lay down if you've got a place fer him git a light buck said the old woman buck got a light a chimneyless smoking oil lamp and led me into the same room where the blight and my little sister were their heads were covered up but the bed in the gloom of one corner was shaking with their smothered laughter buck pointed to the middle bed i can get along without that light buck i said and i must have been rather haughty and abrupt for a stifled shriek came from under the bedclothes in the corner and buck disappeared swiftly preparations for bed are simple in the mountains they were primitively simple for me that night being in knickerbockers i merely took off my coat and shoes presently somebody else stepped into the room and the bed in the other corner creaked silence for a while then the door opened and the head of the old woman was thrust in mart she said coaxingly git up thar now an climb over inter bed with that ar stranger that was mart at last over in the corner mart turned grumbled and to my great pleasure swore that he wouldn't the old woman waited a moment mart she said again with gentle imperiousness git up thar now i tell ye you've got to sleep with that thar stranger she closed the door and with a snort mart piled into bed with me i gave him plenty of room and did not introduce myself a little more dark silence the shaking of the bed under the hilarity of those astonished bethrilled but thoroughly unfrightened young women in the dark corner on my left ceased and again the door opened this time it was the hired man and i saw that the trouble was either that neither mart nor buck wanted to sleep with the hired man or that neither wanted to sleep with me a long silence and then the boy buck slipped in the hired man delivered himself with the intonation somewhat of a circuit rider i've been a watchin that star thar through the winder sometimes hit moves then hit stands plum still an ag'in hit gits to pitchin the hired man must have been touching up mean whiskey himself meanwhile mart seemed to be having spells of troubled slumber he would snore gently accentuate said snore with a sudden quiver of his body and then wake up with a climacteric snort and start that would shake the bed this was repeated several times and i began to think of the unfortunate tom who was fitified mart seemed on the verge of a fit himself and i waited apprehensively for each snorting climax to see if fits were a family failing they were not peace overcame mart and he slept deeply but not i the hired man began to show symptoms he would roll and groan dreaming of feuds _quorum pars magna fuit_ it seemed and of religious conversion in which he feared he was not so great twice he said aloud an i tell you thar wouldn't a one of em have said a word if i'd been killed stone dead twice he said it almost weepingly and now and then he would groan appealingly o lawd have mercy on my pore soul fortunately those two tired girls slept i could hear their breathing but sleep there was little for me once the troubled soul with the hoe got up and stumbled out to the water bucket on the porch to soothe the fever or whatever it was that was burning him and after that he was quiet i awoke before day the dim light at the window showed an empty bed buck and the hired man were gone mart was slipping out of the side of my bed but the girls still slept on i watched mart for i guessed i might now see what perhaps is the distinguishing trait of american civilization down to its bed rock as you find it through the west and in the southern hills a chivalrous respect for women mart thought i was asleep over in the corner were two creatures the like of which i supposed he had never seen and would not see since he came in too late the night before and was going away too early now and two angels straight from heaven could not have stirred my curiosity any more than they already must have stirred his but not once did mart turn his eyes much less his face toward the corner where they were not once for i watched him closely and when he went out he sent his little sister back for his shoes which the night walking hired man had accidentally kicked toward the foot of the strangers bed in a minute i was out after him but he was gone behind me the two girls opened their eyes on a room that was empty save for them then the blight spoke this i was told later dear she said have our room mates gone breakfast at dawn the mountain girls were ready to go to work all looked sorry to have us leave they asked us to come back again and they meant it we said we would like to come back and we meant it to see them the kind old mother the pioneer like old man sturdy little buck shy little cindy the elusive hard working unconsciously shivery mart and the two big sisters as we started back up the river the sisters started for the fields and i thought of their stricken brother in the settlements who must have been much like mart back up the big black mountain we toiled and late in the afternoon we were on the state line that runs the crest of the big black right on top and bisected by that state line sat a dingy little shack and there with one leg thrown over the pommel of his saddle sat marston drinking water from a gourd i was coming over to meet you he said smiling at the blight who greatly pleased"
