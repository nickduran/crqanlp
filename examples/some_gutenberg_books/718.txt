"1" "fool to boot when she was spoken to she had a way of acknowledging your poor tinkle of utterance with a voluminous scornful haw that made you want to burn her alive she also had a way of saying indade with a droop of the eyelids mrs booch was a smaller woman brown haired with queer little curls on either side of her face large blue eyes and a small set of stereotyped remarks that constituted her entire mental range mrs latude fernay has left oddly enough no memory at all except her name and the effect of a green grey silk dress all set with gold and blue buttons i fancy she was a large blonde then there was miss fison the maid who served both lady drew and miss somerville and at the end of the table opposite my mother sat rabbits the butler rabbits for a butler was an unassuming man and at tea he was not as you know butlers but in a morning coat and a black tie with blue spots still he was large with side whiskers even if his clean shaven mouth was weak and little i sat among these people on a high hard early gregorian chair trying to exist like a feeble seedling amidst great rocks and my mother sat with an eye upon me resolute to suppress the slightest manifestation of vitality it was hard on me but perhaps it was also hard upon these rather over fed ageing pretending people that my youthful restlessness and rebellious unbelieving eyes should be thrust in among their dignities tea lasted for nearly three quarters of an hour and i sat it out perforce and day after day the talk was exactly the same sugar mrs mackridge my mother used to ask sugar mrs latude fernay the word sugar would stir the mind of mrs mackridge they say she would begin issuing her proclamation at least half her sentences began they say sugar is fatt an ing nowadays many of the best people do not take it at all not with their tea ma'am said rabbits intelligently not with anything said mrs mackridge with an air of crushing repartee and drank what won't they say next said miss fison they do say such things said mrs booch they say said mrs mackridge inflexibly the doctors are not recomm an ding it now my mother no ma'am mrs mackridge no ma'am then to the table at large poor sir roderick before he died consumed great quan ta ties of sugar i have sometimes fancied it may have hastened his end this ended the first skirmish a certain gloom of manner and a pause was considered due to the sacred memory of sir roderick george said my mother don't kick the chair then perhaps mrs booch would produce a favourite piece from her repertoire the evenings are drawing out nicely she would say or if the season was decadent how the evenings draw in it was an invaluable remark to her i do not know how she would have got along without it my mother who sat with her back to the window would always consider it due to mrs booch to turn about and regard the evening in the act of elongation or contraction whichever phase it might be a brisk discussion of how long we were to the longest or shortest day would ensue and die away at last exhausted mrs mackridge perhaps would reopen she had many intelligent habits among others she read the paper the morning post the other ladies would at times tackle that sheet but only to read the births marriages and deaths on the front page it was of course the old morning post that cost threepence not the brisk coruscating young thing of to day they say she would open that lord tweedums is to go to canada ah said mr rabbits dew they isn't he said my mother the earl of slumgold's cousin she knew he was it was an entirely irrelevant and unnecessary remark but still something to say the same ma'am said mrs mackridge they say he was extremelay popular in new south wales they looked up to him greatlay i knew him ma'am as a young man a very nice pleasant young fella interlude of respect is predecessor said rabbits who had acquired from some clerical model a precise emphatic articulation without acquiring at the same time the aspirates that would have graced it got into trouble at sydney haw said mrs mackridge scornfully so am tawled e came to templemorton after e came back and i remember them talking im over after e'd gone again haw said mrs mackridge interrogatively is fuss was quotin poetry ma'am e said what was it e said they lef their country for their country's good which in some way was took to remind them of their being originally convic's though now reformed every one i eard speak agreed it was takless of im sir roderick used to say said mrs mackridge that the first thing here mrs mackridge paused and looked dreadfully at me and the second thing here she fixed me again and the third thing now i was released needed in a colonial governor is tact she became aware of my doubts again and added predominantly it has always struck me that that was a singularly true remark i resolved that if ever i found this polypus of tact growing up in my soul i would tear it out by the roots throw it forth and stamp on it they're queer people colonials said rabbits very queer when i was at templemorton i see something of em queer fellows some of em very respectful of course free with their money in a spasammy sort of way but some of em i must confess make me nervous they have an eye on you they watch you as you wait they let themselves appear to be lookin at you my mother said nothing in that discussion the word colonies always upset her she was afraid i think that if she turned her mind in that direction my errant father might suddenly and shockingly be discovered no doubt conspicuously bigamic and altogether offensive and revolutionary she did not want to rediscover my father at all it is curious that when i was a little listening boy i had such an idea of our colonies that i jeered in my heart at mrs mackridge's colonial ascendancy these brave emancipated sunburnt english of the open i thought suffer these aristocratic invaders as a quaint anachronism but as for being gratified i don't jeer now i'm not so sure v it is a little difficult to explain why i did not come to do what was the natural thing for any one in my circumstances to do and take my world for granted a certain innate scepticism i think explains it and a certain inaptitude for sympathetic assimilation my father i believe was a sceptic my mother was certainly a hard woman i was an only child and to this day i do not know whether my father is living or dead he fled my mother's virtues before my distincter memories began he left no traces in his flight and she in her indignation destroyed every vestige that she could of him never a photograph nor a scrap of his handwriting have i seen and it was i know only the accepted code of virtue and discretion that prevented her destroying her marriage certificate and me and so making a clean sweep of her matrimonial humiliation i suppose i must inherit something of the moral stupidity that would enable her to make a holocaust of every little personal thing she had of him there must have been presents made by him as a lover for example books with kindly inscriptions letters perhaps a flattened flower a ring or such like gage she kept her wedding ring of course but all the others she destroyed she never told me his christian name or indeed spoke a word to me of him though at times i came near daring to ask her add what i have of him it isn't much i got from his brother my hero my uncle ponderevo she wore her ring her marriage certificate she kept in a sealed envelope in the very bottom of her largest trunk and me she sustained at a private school among the kentish hills you must not think i was always at bladesover even in my holidays if at the time these came round lady drew was vexed by recent company or for any other reason wished to take it out of my mother then she used to ignore the customary reminder my mother gave her and i stayed on at the school but such occasions were rare and i suppose that between ten and fourteen i averaged fifty days a year at bladesover don't imagine i deny that was a fine thing for me bladesover in absorbing the whole countryside had not altogether missed greatness the bladesover system has at least done one good thing for england it has abolished the peasant habit of mind if many of us still live and breathe pantry and housekeeper's room we are quit of the dream of living by economising parasitically on hens and pigs about that park there were some elements of a liberal education there was a great space of greensward not given over to manure and food grubbing there was mystery there was matter for the imagination it was still a park of deer i saw something of the life of these dappled creatures heard the belling of stags came upon young fawns among the bracken found bones skulls and antlers in lonely places there were corners that gave a gleam of meaning to the word forest glimpses of unstudied natural splendour there was a slope of bluebells in the broken sunlight under the newly green beeches in the west wood that is now precious sapphire in my memory it was the first time that i knowingly met beauty and in the house there were books the rubbish old lady drew read i never saw stuff of the maria monk type i have since gathered had a fascination for her but back in the past there had been a drew of intellectual enterprise sir cuthbert the son of sir matthew who built the house and thrust away neglected and despised in an old room upstairs were books and treasures of his that my mother let me rout among during a spell of wintry wet sitting under a dormer window on a shelf above great stores of tea and spices i became familiar with much of hogarth in a big portfolio with raphael there was a great book of engravings from the stanzas of raphael in the vatican and with most of the capitals of europe as they had looked about 1780 by means of several pig iron moulded books of views there was also a broad eighteenth century atlas with huge wandering maps that instructed me mightily it had splendid adornments about each map title holland showed a fisherman and his boat russia a cossack japan remarkable people attired in pagodas i say it deliberately pagodas there were terrae incognitae in every continent then poland sarmatia lands since lost and many a voyage i made with a blunted pin about that large incorrect and dignified world the books in that little old closet had been banished i suppose from the saloon during the victorian revival of good taste and emasculated orthodoxy but my mother had no suspicion of their character so i read and understood the good sound rhetoric of tom paine's rights of man and his common sense excellent books once praised by bishops and since sedulously lied about gulliver was there unexpurgated strong meat for a boy perhaps but not too strong i hold i have never regretted that i escaped niceness in these affairs the satire of traldragdubh made my blood boil as it was meant to do but i hated swift for the houyhnhnms and never quite liked a horse afterwards then i remember also a translation of voltaire's candide and rasselas and vast book though it was i really believe i read in a muzzy sort of way of course from end to end and even with some reference now and then to the atlas gibbon in twelve volumes these readings whetted my taste for more and surreptitiously i raided the bookcases in the big saloon i got through quite a number of books before my sacrilegious temerity was discovered by ann the old head housemaid i remember that among others i tried a translation of plato's republic then and found extraordinarily little interest in it i was much too young for that but vathek vathek was glorious stuff that kicking affair when everybody had to kick the thought of vathek always brings back with it my boyish memory of the big saloon at bladesover it was a huge long room with many windows opening upon the park and each window there were a dozen or more reaching from the floor up had its elaborate silk or satin curtains heavily fringed a canopy is it above its completely white shutters folding into the deep thickness of the wall at either end of that great still place was an immense marble chimney piece the end by the bookcase showed the wolf and romulus and remus with homer and virgil for supporters the design of the other end i have forgotten frederick prince of wales swaggered flatly over the one twice life size but mellowed by the surface gleam of oil and over the other was an equally colossal group of departed drews as sylvan deities scantily clad against a storm rent sky down the centre of the elaborate ceiling were three chandeliers each bearing some hundreds of dangling glass lustres and over the interminable carpet it impressed me as about as big as sarmatia in the store room atlas were islands and archipelagoes of chintz covered chairs and couches tables great sevres vases on pedestals a bronze man and horse somewhere in this wilderness one came i remember upon a big harp beside a lyre shaped music stand and a grand piano the book borrowing raid was one of extraordinary dash and danger one came down the main service stairs that was legal and illegality began in a little landing when very cautiously one went through a red baize door a little passage led to the hall and here one reconnoitered for ann the old head housemaid the younger housemaids were friendly and did not count ann located came a dash across the open space at the foot of that great staircase that has never been properly descended since powder went out of fashion and so to the saloon door a beast of an oscillating chinaman in china as large as life grimaced and quivered to one's lightest steps that door was the perilous place it was double with the thickness of the wall between so that one could not listen beforehand for the whisk of the feather brush on the other side oddly rat like is it not this darting into enormous places in pursuit of the abandoned crumbs of thought and i found langhorne's plutarch too i remember on those shelves it seems queer to me now to think that i acquired pride and self respect the idea of a state and the germ of public spirit in such a furtive fashion queer too that it should rest with an old greek dead these eighteen hundred years to teach that vi the school i went to was the sort of school the bladesover system permitted the public schools that add comic into existence in the brief glow of the renascence had been taken possession of by the ruling class the lower classes were not supposed to stand in need of schools and our middle stratum got the schools it deserved private schools schools any unqualified pretender was free to establish mine was kept by a man who had had the energy to get himself a college of preceptors diploma and considering how cheap his charges were i will readily admit the place might have been worse the building was a dingy yellow brick residence outside the village with the schoolroom as an outbuilding of lath and plaster i do not remember that my school days were unhappy indeed i recall a good lot of fine mixed fun in them but i cannot without grave risk of misinterpretation declare that we were at all nice and refined we fought much not sound formal fighting but scrapping of a sincere and murderous kind into which one might bring one's boots it made us tough at any rate and several of us were the sons of london publicans who distinguished scraps where one meant to hurt from ordered pugilism practising both arts and having moreover precocious linguistic gifts our cricket field was bald about the wickets and we played without style and disputed with the umpire and the teaching was chiefly in the hands of a lout of nineteen who wore ready made clothes and taught despicably the head master and proprietor taught us arithmetic algebra and euclid and to the older boys even trigonometry himself he had a strong mathematical bias and i think now that by the standard of a british public school he did rather well by us we had one inestimable privilege at that school and that was spiritual neglect we dealt with one another with the forcible simplicity of natural boys we cheeked and punched and clouted we thought ourselves red indians and cowboys and such like honourable things and not young english gentlemen we never felt the strain of onward christian soldiers nor were swayed by any premature piety in the cold oak pew of our sunday devotions all that was good we spent our rare pennies in the uncensored reading matter of the village dame's shop on the boys of england and honest penny dreadfuls ripping stuff stuff that anticipated haggard and stevenson badly printed and queerly illustrated and very very good for us on our half holidays we were allowed the unusual freedom of rambling in twos and threes wide and far about the land talking experimentally dreaming wildly there was much in those walks to this day the landscape of the kentish world with its low broad distances its hop gardens and golden stretches of wheat its oasts and square church towers its background of downland and hangers has for me a faint sense of adventure added to the pleasure of its beauty we smoked on occasion but nobody put us up to the proper boyish things to do we never robbed an orchard for example though there were orchards all about us we thought stealing was sinful we stole incidental apples and turnips and strawberries from the fields indeed but in a criminal inglorious fashion and afterwards we were ashamed we had our days of adventure but they were natural accidents our own adventures there was one hot day when several of us walking out towards maidstone were incited by the devil to despise ginger beer and we fuddled ourselves dreadfully with ale and a time when our young minds were infected to the pitch of buying pistols by the legend of the wild west young roots from highbury came back with a revolver and cartridges and we went off six strong to live a free wild life one holiday afternoon we fired our first shot deep in the old flint mine at chiselstead and nearly burst our ear drums then we fired in a primrose studded wood by pickthorn green and i gave a false alarm of keeper and we fled in disorder for a mile after which roots suddenly shot at a pheasant in the high road by chiselstead and then young barker told lies about the severity of the game laws and made roots sore afraid and we hid the pistol in a dry ditch outside the school field a day or so after we got in again and ignoring a certain fouling and rusting of the barrel tried for a rabbit at three hundred yards young roots blew a molehill at twenty paces into a dust cloud burnt his fingers and scorched his face and the weapon having once displayed this strange disposition to flame back upon the shooter was not subsequently fired one main source of excitement for us was cheeking people in vans and carts upon the goudhurst road and getting myself into a monstrous white mess in the chalk pits beyond the village and catching yellow jaundice as a sequel to bathing stark naked with three other adamites old ewart leading that function in the rivulet across hickson's meadows are among my memorabilia those free imaginative afternoons how much they were for us how much they did for us all streams came from the then undiscovered sources of the nile in those days all thickets were indian jungles and our best game i say it with pride i invented i got it out of the bladesover saloon we found a wood where trespassing was forbidden and did the retreat of the ten thousand through it from end to end cutting our way bravely through a host of nettle beds that barred our path and not forgetting to weep and kneel when at last we emerged within sight of the high road sea so we have burst at times weeping and rejoicing upon startled wayfarers usually i took the part of that distinguished general xenophen and please note the quantity of the o i have all my classical names like that socrates rhymes with bates for me and except when the bleak eye of some scholar warns me of his standards of judgment i use those dear old mispronunciations still the little splash into latin made during my days as a chemist washed off nothing of the habit well if i met those great gentlemen of the past with their accents carelessly adjusted i did at least meet them alive as an equal and in a living tongue altogether my school might easily have been worse for me and among other good things it gave me a friend who has lasted my life out this was ewart who is now a monumental artist at woking after many vicissitudes dear chap how he did stick out of his clothes to be sure he was a longlimbed lout ridiculously tall beside my more youth full compactness and except that there was no black moustache under his nose blob he had the same round knobby face as he has to day the same bright and active hazel brown eyes the stare the meditative moment the insinuating reply surely no boy ever played the fool as bob ewart used to play it no boy had a readier knack of mantling the world with wonder commonness vanished before ewart at his expository touch all things became memorable and rare from him i first heard tell of love but only after its barbs were already sticking in my heart he was i know now the bastard of that great improvident artist rickmann ewart he brought the light of a lax world that at least had not turned its back upon beauty into the growing fermentation of my mind i won his heart by a version of vathek and after that we were inseparable yarning friends we merged our intellectual stock so completely that i wonder sometimes how much i did not become ewart how much ewart is not vicariously and derivatively me vii and then when i had newly passed my fourteenth birthday came my tragic disgrace it was in my midsummer holidays that the thing happened and it was through the honourable beatrice normandy she had come into my life as they say before i was twelve she descended unexpectedly into a peaceful interlude that followed the annual going of those three great women she came into the old nursery upstairs and every day she had tea with us in the housekeeper's room she was eight and she came with a nurse called nannie and to begin with i did not like her at all nobody liked this irruption into the downstairs rooms the two gave trouble a dire offence nannie's sense of duty to her charge led to requests and demands that took my mother's breath away eggs at unusual times the reboiling of milk the rejection of an excellent milk pudding not negotiated respectfully but dictated as of right nannie was a dark longfeatured taciturn woman in a grey dress she had a furtive inflexibility of manner that finally dismayed and crushed and overcame she conveyed she was under orders like a greek tragedy she was that strange product of the old time a devoted trusted servant she had as it were banked all her pride and will with the greater more powerful people who employed her in return for a life long security of servitude the bargain was nonetheless binding for being implicit finally they were to pension her and she would die the hated treasure of a boarding house she had built up in herself an enormous habit of reference to these upstairs people she had curbed down all discordant murmurings of her soul her very instincts were perverted or surrendered she was sexless her personal pride was all transferred she mothered another woman's child with a hard joyless devotion that was at least entirely compatible with a stoical separation she treated us all as things that counted for nothing save to fetch and carry for her charge but the honourable beatrice could condescend the queer chances of later years come between me and a distinctly separated memory of that childish face when i think of beatrice i think of her as i came to know her at a later time when at last i came to know her so well that indeed now i could draw her and show a hundred little delicate things you would miss in looking at her but even then i remember how i noted the infinite delicacy of her childish skin and the fine eyebrow finer than the finest feather that ever one felt on the breast of a bird she was one of those elfin rather precocious little girls quick coloured with dark hair naturally curling dusky hair that was sometimes astray over her eyes and eyes that were sometimes impishly dark and sometimes a clear brown yellow and from the very outset after a most cursory attention to rabbits she decided that the only really interesting thing at the tea table was myself the elders talked in their formal dull way telling nannie the trite old things about the park and the village that they told every one and beatrice watched me across the table with a pitiless little curiosity that made me uncomfortable nannie she said pointing and nannie left a question of my mother's disregarded to attend to her is he a servant boy s s sh said nannie he's master ponderevo is he a servant boy repeated beatrice he's a schoolboy said my mother then may i talk to him nannie nannie surveyed me with brutal inhumanity you mustn't talk too much she said to her charge and cut cake into fingers for her no she added decisively as beatrice made to speak beatrice became malignant her eyes explored me with unjustifiable hostility he's got dirty hands she said stabbing at the forbidden fruit and there's a fray to his collar then she gave herself up to cake with an appearance of entire forgetfulness of me that filled me with hate and a passionate desire to compel her to admire me and the next day before tea i did for the first time in my life freely without command or any compulsion wash my hands so our acquaintance began and presently was deepened by a whim of hers she had a cold and was kept indoors and confronted nannie suddenly with the alternative of being hopelessly naughty which in her case involved a generous amount of screaming unsuitable for the ears of an elderly shaky rich aunt or having me up to the nursery to play with her all the afternoon nannie came downstairs and borrowed me in a careworn manner and i was handed over to the little creature as if i was some large variety of kitten i had never had anything to do with a little girl before i thought she was more beautiful and wonderful and bright than anything else could possibly be in life and she found me the gentlest of slaves though at the same time as i made evident fairly strong and nannie was amazed to find the afternoon slip cheerfully and rapidly away she praised my manners to lady drew and to my mother who said she was glad to hear well of me and after that i played with beatrice several times the toys she had remain in my memory still as great splendid things gigantic to all my previous experience of toys and we even went to the great doll's house on the nursery landing to play discreetly with that the great doll's house that the prince regent had given sir harry drew's first born who died at five that was a not ineffectual model of bladesover itself and contained eighty five dolls and had cost hundreds of pounds i played under imperious direction with that toy of glory i went back to school when that holiday was over dreaming of beautiful things and got ewart to talk to me of love and"
