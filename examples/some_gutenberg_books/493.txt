"1" "them some of my adventures such as they were and they marvelled greatly at the extent of my experience hermann would translate what he thought the most striking passages getting up on his legs and as if delivering a lecture on a phenomenon he addressed himself with gestures to the two women who would let their sewing sink slowly on their laps meantime i sat before a glass of hermann's beer trying to look modest mrs hermann would glance at me quickly emit slight ach's the girl never made a sound never but she too would sometimes raise her pale eyes to look at me in her unseeing gentle way her glance was by no means stupid it beamed out soft and diffuse as the moon beams upon a landscape quite differently from the scrutinising inspection of the stars you were drowned in it and imagined yourself to appear blurred and yet this same glance when turned upon christian falk must have been as efficient as the searchlight of a battle ship falk was the other assiduous visitor on board but from his behaviour he might have been coming to see the quarter deck capstan he certainly used to stare at it a good deal when keeping us company outside the cabin door with one muscular arm thrown over the back of the chair and his big shapely legs in very tight white trousers extended far out and ending in a pair of black shoes as roomy as punts on arrival he would shake hermann's hand with a mutter bow to the women and take up his careless and misanthropic attitude by our side he departed abruptly with a jump going through the performance of grunts handshakes bow as if in a panic sometimes with a sort of discreet and convulsive effort he approached the women and exchanged a few low words with them half a dozen at most on these occasions hermann's usual stare became positively glassy and mrs hermann's kind countenance would colour up the girl herself never turned a hair falk was a dane or perhaps a norwegian i can't tell now at all events he was a scandinavian of some sort and a bloated monopolist to boot it is possible he was unacquainted with the word but he had a clear perception of the thing itself his tariff of charges for towing ships in and out was the most brutally inconsiderate document of the sort i had ever seen he was the commander and owner of the only tug boat on the river a very trim white craft of 150 tons or more as elegantly neat as a yacht with a round wheel house rising like a glazed turret high above her sharp bows and with one slender varnished pole mast forward i daresay there are yet a few shipmasters afloat who remember falk and his tug very well he extracted his pound and a half of flesh from each of us merchant skippers with an inflexible sort of indifference which made him detested and even feared schomberg used to remark i won't talk about the fellow i don't think he has six drinks from year's end to year's end in my place but my advice is gentlemen don't you have anything to do with him if you can help it this advice apart from unavoidable business relations was easy to follow because falk intruded upon no one it seems absurd to compare a tugboat skipper to a centaur but he reminded me somehow of an engraving in a little book i had as a boy which represented centaurs at a stream and there was one especially in the foreground prancing bow and arrows in hand with regular severe features and an immense curled wavy beard flowing down his breast falk's face reminded me of that centaur besides he was a composite creature not a man horse it is true but a man boat he lived on board his tug which was always dashing up and down the river from early morn till dewy eve in the last rays of the setting sun you could pick out far away down the reach his beard borne high up on the white structure foaming up stream to anchor for the night there was the white clad man's body and the rich brown patch of the hair and nothing below the waist but the thwart ship white lines of the bridge screens that lead the eye to the sharp white lines of the bows cleaving the muddy water of the river separated from his boat to me at least he seemed incomplete the tug herself without his head and torso on the bridge looked mutilated as it were but he left her very seldom all the time i remained in harbour i saw him only twice on shore on the first occasion it was at my charterers where he came in misanthropically to get paid for towing out a french barque the day before the second time i could hardly believe my eyes for i beheld him reclining under his beard in a cane bottomed chair in the billiard room of schomberg's hotel it was very funny to see schomberg ignoring him pointedly the artificiality of it contrasted strongly with falk's natural unconcern the big alsatian talked loudly with his other customers going from one little table to the other and passing falk's place of repose with his eyes fixed straight ahead falk sat there with an untouched glass at his elbow he must have known by sight and name every white man in the room but he never addressed a word to anybody he acknowledged my presence by a drop of his eyelids and that was all sprawling there in the chair he would now and again draw the palms of both his hands down his face giving at the same time a slight almost imperceptible shudder it was a habit he had and of course i was perfectly familiar with it since you could not remain an hour in his company without being made to wonder at such a movement breaking some long period of stillness it was a passionate and inexplicable gesture he used to make it at all sorts of times as likely as not after he had been listening to little lena's chatter about the suffering doll for instance the hermann children always besieged him about his legs closely though in a gentle way he shrank from them a little he seemed however to feel a great affection for the whole family for hermann himself especially he sought his company in this case for instance he must have been waiting for him because as soon as he appeared falk rose hastily and they went out together then schomberg expounded in my hearing to three or four people his theory that falk was after captain hermann's niece and asserted confidently that nothing would come of it it was the same last year when captain hermann was loading here he said naturally i did not believe schomberg but i own that for a time i observed closely what went on all i discovered was some impatience on hermann's part at the sight of falk stepping over the gangway the excellent man would begin to mumble and chew between his teeth something that sounded like german swear words however as i've said i'm not familiar with the language and hermann's soft round eyed countenance remained unchanged staring stolidly ahead he greeted him with wie gehts or in english how are you with a throaty enunciation the girl would look up for an instant and move her lips slightly mrs hermann let her hands rest on her lap to talk volubly to him for a minute or so in her pleasant voice before she went on with her sewing again falk would throw himself into a chair stretch his big legs as like as not draw his hands down his face passionately as to myself he was not pointedly impertinent it was rather as though he could not be bothered with such trifles as my existence and the truth is that being a monopolist he was under no necessity to be amiable he was sure to get his own extortionate terms out of me for towage whether he frowned or smiled as a matter of fact he did neither but before many days elapsed he managed to astonish me not a little and to set schomberg's tongue clacking more than ever it came about in this way there was a shallow bar at the mouth of the river which ought to have been kept down but the authorities of the state were piously busy gilding afresh the great buddhist pagoda just then and i suppose had no money to spare for dredging operations i don't know how it may be now but at the time i speak of that sandbank was a great nuisance to the shipping one of its consequences was that vessels of a certain draught of water like hermann's or mine could not complete their loading in the river after taking in as much as possible of their cargo they had to go outside to fill up the whole procedure was an unmitigated bore when you thought you had as much on board as your ship could carry safely over the bar you went and gave notice to your agents they in their turn notified falk that so and so was ready to go out then falk ostensibly when it fitted in with his other work but if the truth were known simply when his arbitrary spirit moved him after ascertaining carefully in the office that there was enough money to meet his bill would come along unsympathetically glaring at you with his yellow eyes from the bridge and would drag you out dishevelled as to rigging lumbered as to the decks with unfeeling haste as if to execution and he would force you too to take the end of his own wire hawser for the use of which there was of course an extra charge to your shouted remonstrances against that extortion this towering trunk with one hand on the engine room telegraph only shook its bearded head above the splash the racket and the clouds of smoke in which the tug backing and filling in the smother of churning paddle wheels behaved like a ferocious and impatient creature he had her manned by the cheekiest gang of lascars i ever did see whom he allowed to bawl at you insolently and once fast he plucked you out of your berth as if he did not care what he smashed eighteen miles down the river you had to go behind him and then three more along the coast to where a group of uninhabited rocky islets enclosed a sheltered anchorage there you would have to lie at single anchor with your naked spars showing to seaward over these barren fragments of land scattered upon a very intensely blue sea there was nothing to look at besides but a bare coast the muddy edge of the brown plain with the sinuosities of the river you had left traced in dull green and the great pagoda uprising lonely and massive with shining curves and pinnacles like the gorgeous and stony efflorescence of tropical rocks you had nothing to do but to wait fretfully for the balance of your cargo which was sent out of the river with the greatest irregularity and it was open to you to console yourself with the thought that after all this stage of bother meant that your departure from these shores was indeed approaching at last we both had to go through that stage hermann and i and there was a sort of tacit emulation between the ships as to which should be ready first we kept on neck and neck almost to the finish when i won the race by going personally to give notice in the forenoon whereas hermann who was very slow in making up his mind to go ashore did not get to the agents office till late in the day they told him there that my ship was first on turn for next morning and i believe he told them he was in no hurry it suited him better to go the day after that evening on board the diana he sat with his plump knees well apart staring and puffing at the curved mouthpiece of his pipe presently he spoke with some impatience to his niece about putting the children to bed mrs hermann who was talking to falk stopped short and looked at her husband uneasily but the girl got up at once and drove the children before her into the cabin in a little while mrs hermann had to leave us to quell what from the sounds inside must have been a dangerous mutiny at this hermann grumbled to himself for half an hour longer falk left alone with us fidgeted on his chair sighed lightly then at last after drawing his hands down his face got up and as if renouncing the hope of making himself understood he hadn't opened his mouth once he said in english well good night captain hermann he stopped for a moment before my chair and looked down fixedly i may even say he glared and he went so far as to make a deep noise in his throat there was in all this something so marked that for the first time in our limited intercourse of nods and grunts he excited in me something like interest but next moment he disappointed me for he strode away hastily without a nod even his manner was usually odd it is true and i certainly did not pay much attention to it but that sort of obscure intention which seemed to lurk in his nonchalance like a wary old carp in a pond had never before come so near the surface he had distinctly aroused my expectations i would have been unable to say what it was i expected but at all events i did not expect the absurd developments he sprung upon me no later than the break of the very next day i remember only that there was on that evening enough point in his behaviour to make me after he had fled wonder audibly what he might mean to this hermann crossing his legs with a swing and settling himself viciously away from me in his chair said that fellow don't know himself what he means there might have been some insight in such a remark i said nothing and still averted he added when i was here last year he was just the same an eruption of tobacco smoke enveloped his head as if his temper had exploded like gunpowder i had half a mind to ask him point blank whether he at least didn't know why falk a notoriously unsociable man had taken to visiting his ship with such assiduity after all i reflected suddenly it was a most remarkable thing i wonder now what hermann would have said as it turned out he didn't let me ask forgetting all about falk apparently he started a monologue on his plans for the future the selling of the ship the going home and falling into a reflective and calculating mood he mumbled between regular jets of smoke about the expense the necessity of disbursing passage money for all his tribe seemed to disturb him in a manner that was the more striking because otherwise he gave no signs of a miserly disposition and yet he fussed over the prospect of that voyage home in a mail boat like a sedentary grocer who has made up his mind to see the world he was racially thrifty i suppose and for him there must have been a great novelty in finding himself obliged to pay for travelling for sea travelling which was the normal state of life for the family from the very cradle for most of them i could see he grudged prospectively every single shilling which must be spent so absurdly it was rather funny he would become doleful over it and then again with a fretful sigh he would suppose there was nothing for it now but to take three second class tickets and there were the four children to pay for besides a lot of money that to spend at once a big lot of money i sat with him listening not for the first time to these heart searchings till i grew thoroughly sleepy and then i left him and turned in on board my ship at daylight i was awakened by a yelping of shrill voices accompanied by a great commotion in the water and the short bullying blasts of a steam whistle falk with his tug had come for me i began to dress it was remarkable that the answering noise on board my ship together with the patter of feet above my head ceased suddenly but i heard more remote guttural cries which seemed to express surprise and annoyance then the voice of my mate reached me howling expostulations to somebody at a distance other voices joined apparently indignant a chorus of something that sounded like abuse replied now and then the steam whistle screeched altogether that unnecessary uproar was distracting but down there in my cabin i took it calmly in another moment i thought i should be going down that wretched river and in another week at the most i should be totally quit of the odious place and all the odious people in it greatly cheered by the idea i seized the hair brushes and looking at myself in the glass began to use them suddenly a hush fell upon the noise outside and i heard the ports of my cabin were thrown open i heard a deep calm voice not on board my ship however hailing resolutely in english but with a strong foreign twang go ahead there may be tides in the affairs of men which taken at the flood and so on personally i am still on the look out for that important turn i am however afraid that most of us are fated to flounder for ever in the dead water of a pool whose shores are arid indeed but i know that there are often in men's affairs unexpectedly even irrationally illuminating moments when an otherwise insignificant sound perhaps only some perfectly commonplace gesture suffices to reveal to us all the unreason all the fatuous unreason of our complacency go ahead are not particularly striking words even when pronounced with a foreign accent yet they petrified me in the very act of smiling at myself in the glass and then refusing to believe my ears but already boiling with indignation i ran out of the cabin and up on deck it was incredibly true it was perfectly true i had no eyes for anything but the diana it was she then was being taken away she was already out of her berth and shooting athwart the river the way this loonatic plucked that ship out is a caution said the awed voice of my mate close to my ear hey hallo falk hermann what's this infernal trick i yelled in a fury nobody heard me falk certainly could not hear me his tug was turning at full speed away under the other bank the wire hawser between her and the diana stretched as taut as a harp string vibrated alarmingly the high black craft careened over to the awful strain a loud crack came out of her followed by the tearing and splintering of wood there said the awed voice in my ear he's carried away their towing chock and then with enthusiasm oh look look sir look at them dutchmen skipping out of the way on the forecastle i hope to goodness he'll break a few of their shins before he's done with em i yelled my vain protests the rays of the rising sun coursing level along the plain warmed my back but i was hot enough with rage i could not have believed that a simple towing operation could suggest so plainly the idea of abduction of rape falk was simply running off with the diana the white tug careered out into the middle of the river the red floats of her paddle wheels revolving with mad rapidity tore up the whole reach into foam the diana in mid stream waltzed round with as much grace as an old barn and flew after her ravisher through the ragged fog of smoke driving headlong upon the water i had a glimpse of falk's square motionless shoulders under a white hat as big as a cart wheel of his red face his yellow staring eyes his great beard instead of keeping a lookout ahead he was deliberately turning his back on the river to glare at his tow the tall heavy craft never so used before in her life seemed to have lost her senses she took a wild sheer against her helm and for a moment came straight at us menacing and clumsy like a runaway mountain she piled up a streaming hissing boiling wave half way up her blunt stem my crew let out one great howl and then we held our breaths it was a near thing but falk had her he had her in his clutch i fancied i could hear the steel hawser ping as it surged across the diana's forecastle with the hands on board of her bolting away from it in all directions it was a near thing hermann with his hair rumpled in a snuffy flannel shirt and a pair of mustard coloured trousers had rushed to help with the wheel i saw his terrified round face i saw his very teeth uncovered by a sort of ghastly fixed grin and in a great leaping tumult of water between the two ships the diana whisked past so close that i could have flung a hair brush at his head for it seems i had kept them in my hands all the time meanwhile mrs hermann sat placidly on the skylight with a woollen shawl on her shoulders the excellent woman in response to my indignant gesticulations fluttered a handkerchief nodding and smiling in the kindest way imaginable the boys only half dressed were jumping about the poop in great glee displaying their gaudy braces and lena in a short scarlet petticoat with peaked elbows and thin bare arms nursed the rag doll with devotion the whole family passed before my sight as if dragged across a scene of unparalleled violence the last i saw was hermann's niece with the baby hermann in her arms standing apart from the others magnificent in her close fitting print frock she displayed something so commanding in the manifest perfection of her figure that the sun seemed to be rising for her alone the flood of light brought out the opulence of her form and the vigour of her youth in a glorifying way she went by perfectly motionless and as if lost in meditation only the hem of her skirt stirred in the draught the sun rays broke on her sleek tawny hair that bald headed ruffian nicholas was whacking her on the shoulder i saw his tiny fat arm rise and fall in a workmanlike manner and then the four cottage windows of the diana came into view retreating swiftly down the river the sashes were up and one of the white calico curtains was fluttered straight out like a streamer above the agitated water of the wake to be thus tricked out of one's turn was an unheard of occurrence in my agent's office where i went to complain at once they protested with apologies they couldn't understand how the mistake arose but schomberg when i dropped in later to get some tiffin though surprised to see me was perfectly ready with an explanation i found him seated at the end of a long narrow table facing his wife a scraggy little woman with long ringlets and a blue tooth who smiled abroad stupidly and looked frightened when you spoke to her between them a waggling punkah fanned twenty cane bottomed chairs and two rows of shiny plates three chinamen in white jackets loafed with napkins in their hands around that desolation schomberg's pet table d'hote was not much of a success that day he was feeding himself ferociously and seemed to overflow with bitterness he began by ordering in a brutal voice the chops to be brought back for me and turning in his chair mistake they told you not a bit of it don't you believe it for a moment captain falk isn't a man to make mistakes unless on purpose his firm conviction was that falk had been trying all along to curry favour on the cheap with hermann on the cheap mind you it doesn't cost him a cent to put that insult upon you and captain hermann gets in a day ahead of your ship time's money eh you are very friendly with captain hermann i believe but a man is bound to be pleased at any little advantage he may get captain hermann is a good business man and there's no such thing as a friend in business is there he leaned forward and began to cast stealthy glances as usual but falk is and always was a miserable fellow i would despise him i muttered grumpily that i had no particular respect for falk i would despise him he insisted with an appearance of anxiety which would have amused me if i had not been fathoms deep in discontent to a young man fairly conscientious and as well meaning as only the young man can be the current ill usage of life comes with a peculiar cruelty youth that is fresh enough to believe in guilt in innocence and in itself will always doubt whether it have not perchance deserved its fate sombre of mind and without appetite i struggled with the chop while mrs schomberg sat with her everlasting stupid grin and schomberg's talk gathered way like a slide of rubbish let me tell you it's all about that girl i don't know what captain hermann expects but if he asked me i could tell him something about falk he's a miserable fellow that man is a perfect slave that's what i call him a slave last year i started this table d'hote and sent cards out you know you think he had one meal in the house give the thing a trial not once he has got hold now of a madras cook a blamed fraud that i hunted out of my cookhouse with a rattan he was not fit to cook for white men no not for the white men's dogs either but see any damned native that can boil a pot of rice is good enough for mr falk rice and a little fish he buys for a few cents from the fishing boats outside is what he lives on you would hardly credit it eh a white man too he wiped his lips using the napkin with indignation and looking at me it flashed through my mind in the midst of my depression that if all the meat in the town was like these table d'hote chops falk wasn't so far wrong i was on the point of saying this but schomberg's stare was intimidating he's a vegetarian perhaps i murmured instead he's a miser a miserable miser affirmed the hotel keeper with great force the meat here is not so good as at home of course and dear too but look at me i only charge a dollar for the tiffin and one dollar and fifty cents for the dinner show me anything cheaper why am i doing it there's little profit in this game falk wouldn't look at it i do it for the sake of a lot of young white fellows here that hadn't a place where they could get a decent meal and eat it decently in good company there's first rate company always at my table the convinced way he surveyed the empty chairs made me feel as if i had intruded upon a tiffin of ghostly presences a white man should eat like a white man dash it all he burst out impetuously ought to eat meat must eat meat i manage to get meat for my patrons all the year round don't i i am not catering for a dam lot of coolies have another chop captain no you boy take away he threw himself back and waited grimly for the curry the half closed jalousies darkened the room pervaded by the smell of fresh whitewash a swarm of flies buzzed and settled in turns and poor mrs schomberg's smile seemed to express the quintessence of all the imbecility that had ever spoken had ever breathed had ever been fed on infamous buffalo meat within these bare walls schomberg did not open his lips till he was ready to thrust therein a spoonful of greasy rice he rolled his eyes ridiculously before he swallowed the hot stuff and only then broke out afresh it is the most degrading thing they take the dish up to the wheelhouse for him with a cover on it and he shuts both the doors before he begins to eat fact must be ashamed of himself ask the engineer he can't do without an engineer don't you see and as no respectable man can be expected to put up with such a table he allows them fifteen dollars a month extra mess money i assure you it is so you just"
