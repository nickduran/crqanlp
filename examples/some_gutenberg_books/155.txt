"1" "waste of good writing paper what's to be done now nothing that i know of except for you to keep your temper and for me to begin it all over again for the third time chapter iii the question of how i am to start the story properly i have tried to settle in two ways first by scratching my head which led to nothing second by consulting my daughter penelope which has resulted in an entirely new idea penelope's notion is that i should set down what happened regularly day by day beginning with the day when we got the news that mr franklin blake was expected on a visit to the house when you come to fix your memory with a date in this way it is wonderful what your memory will pick up for you upon that compulsion the only difficulty is to fetch out the dates in the first place this penelope offers to do for me by looking into her own diary which she was taught to keep when she was at school and which she has gone on keeping ever since in answer to an improvement on this notion devised by myself namely that she should tell the story instead of me out of her own diary penelope observes with a fierce look and a red face that her journal is for her own private eye and that no living creature shall ever know what is in it but herself when i inquire what this means penelope says fiddlesticks i say sweethearts beginning then on penelope's plan i beg to mention that i was specially called one wednesday morning into my lady's own sitting room the date being the twenty fourth of may eighteen hundred and forty eight gabriel says my lady here is news that will surprise you franklin blake has come back from abroad he has been staying with his father in london and he is coming to us to morrow to stop till next month and keep rachel's birthday if i had had a hat in my hand nothing but respect would have prevented me from throwing that hat up to the ceiling i had not seen mr franklin since he was a boy living along with us in this house he was out of all sight as i remember him the nicest boy that ever spun a top or broke a window miss rachel who was present and to whom i made that remark observed in return that she remembered him as the most atrocious tyrant that ever tortured a doll and the hardest driver of an exhausted little girl in string harness that england could produce i burn with indignation and i ache with fatigue was the way miss rachel summed it up when i think of franklin blake hearing what i now tell you you will naturally ask how it was that mr franklin should have passed all the years from the time when he was a boy to the time when he was a man out of his own country i answer because his father had the misfortune to be next heir to a dukedom and not to be able to prove it in two words this was how the thing happened my lady's eldest sister married the celebrated mr blake equally famous for his great riches and his great suit at law how many years he went on worrying the tribunals of his country to turn out the duke in possession and to put himself in the duke's place how many lawyer's purses he filled to bursting and how many otherwise harmless people he set by the ears together disputing whether he was right or wrong is more by a great deal than i can reckon up his wife died and two of his three children died before the tribunals could make up their minds to show him the door and take no more of his money when it was all over and the duke in possession was left in possession mr blake discovered that the only way of being even with his country for the manner in which it had treated him was not to let his country have the honour of educating his son how can i trust my native institutions was the form in which he put it after the way in which my native institutions have behaved to me add to this that mr blake disliked all boys his own included and you will admit that it could only end in one way master franklin was taken from us in england and was sent to institutions which his father could trust in that superior country germany mr blake himself you will observe remaining snug in england to improve his fellow countrymen in the parliament house and to publish a statement on the subject of the duke in possession which has remained an unfinished statement from that day to this there thank god that's told neither you nor i need trouble our heads any more about mr blake senior leave him to the dukedom and let you and i stick to the diamond the diamond takes us back to mr franklin who was the innocent means of bringing that unlucky jewel into the house our nice boy didn't forget us after he went abroad he wrote every now and then sometimes to my lady sometimes to miss rachel and sometimes to me we had had a transaction together before he left which consisted in his borrowing of me a ball of string a four bladed knife and seven and sixpence in money the colour of which last i have not seen and never expect to see again his letters to me chiefly related to borrowing more i heard however from my lady how he got on abroad as he grew in years and stature after he had learnt what the institutions of germany could teach him he gave the french a turn next and the italians a turn after that they made him among them a sort of universal genius as well as i could understand it he wrote a little he painted a little he sang and played and composed a little borrowing as i suspect in all these cases just as he had borrowed from me his mother's fortune seven hundred a year fell to him when he came of age and ran through him as it might be through a sieve the more money he had the more he wanted there was a hole in mr franklin's pocket that nothing would sew up wherever he went the lively easy way of him made him welcome he lived here there and everywhere his address as he used to put it himself being post office europe to be left till called for twice over he made up his mind to come back to england and see us and twice over saving your presence some unmentionable woman stood in the way and stopped him his third attempt succeeded as you know already from what my lady told me on thursday the twenty fifth of may we were to see for the first time what our nice boy had grown to be as a man he came of good blood he had a high courage and he was five and twenty years of age by our reckoning now you know as much of mr franklin blake as i did before mr franklin blake came down to our house the thursday was as fine a summer's day as ever you saw and my lady and miss rachel not expecting mr franklin till dinner time drove out to lunch with some friends in the neighbourhood when they were gone i went and had a look at the bedroom which had been got ready for our guest and saw that all was straight then being butler in my lady's establishment as well as steward at my own particular request mind and because it vexed me to see anybody but myself in possession of the key of the late sir john's cellar then i say i fetched up some of our famous latour claret and set it in the warm summer air to take off the chill before dinner concluding to set myself in the warm summer air next seeing that what is good for old claret is equally good for old age i took up my beehive chair to go out into the back court when i was stopped by hearing a sound like the soft beating of a drum on the terrace in front of my lady's residence going round to the terrace i found three mahogany coloured indians in white linen frocks and trousers looking up at the house the indians as i saw on looking closer had small hand drums slung in front of them behind them stood a little delicate looking light haired english boy carrying a bag i judged the fellows to be strolling conjurors and the boy with the bag to be carrying the tools of their trade one of the three who spoke english and who exhibited i must own the most elegant manners presently informed me that my judgment was right he requested permission to show his tricks in the presence of the lady of the house now i am not a sour old man i am generally all for amusement and the last person in the world to distrust another person because he happens to be a few shades darker than myself but the best of us have our weaknesses and my weakness when i know a family plate basket to be out on a pantry table is to be instantly reminded of that basket by the sight of a strolling stranger whose manners are superior to my own i accordingly informed the indian that the lady of the house was out and i warned him and his party off the premises he made me a beautiful bow in return and he and his party went off the premises on my side i returned to my beehive chair and set myself down on the sunny side of the court and fell if the truth must be owned not exactly into a sleep but into the next best thing to it i was roused up by my daughter penelope running out at me as if the house was on fire what do you think she wanted she wanted to have the three indian jugglers instantly taken up for this reason namely that they knew who was coming from london to visit us and that they meant some mischief to mr franklin blake mr franklin's name roused me i opened my eyes and made my girl explain herself it appeared that penelope had just come from our lodge where she had been having a gossip with the lodge keeper's daughter the two girls had seen the indians pass out after i had warned them off followed by their little boy taking it into their heads that the boy was ill used by the foreigners for no reason that i could discover except that he was pretty and delicate looking the two girls had stolen along the inner side of the hedge between us and the road and had watched the proceedings of the foreigners on the outer side those proceedings resulted in the performance of the following extraordinary tricks they first looked up the road and down the road and made sure that they were alone then they all three faced about and stared hard in the direction of our house then they jabbered and disputed in their own language and looked at each other like men in doubt then they all turned to their little english boy as if they expected him to help them and then the chief indian who spoke english said to the boy hold out your hand on hearing those dreadful words my daughter penelope said she didn't know what prevented her heart from flying straight out of her i thought privately that it might have been her stays all i said however was you make my flesh creep nota bene women like these little compliments well when the indian said hold out your hand the boy shrunk back and shook his head and said he didn't like it the indian thereupon asked him not at all unkindly whether he would like to be sent back to london and left where they had found him sleeping in an empty basket in a market a hungry ragged and forsaken little boy this it seems ended the difficulty the little chap unwillingly held out his hand upon that the indian took a bottle from his bosom and poured out of it some black stuff like ink into the palm of the boy's hand the indian first touching the boy's head and making signs over it in the air then said look the boy became quite stiff and stood like a statue looking into the ink in the hollow of his hand so far it seemed to me to be juggling accompanied by a foolish waste of ink i was beginning to feel sleepy again when penelope's next words stirred me up the indians looked up the road and down the road once more and then the chief indian said these words to the boy see the english gentleman from foreign parts the boy said i see him the indian said is it on the road to this house and on no other that the english gentleman will travel to day the boy said it is on the road to this house and on no other that the english gentleman will travel to day the indian put a second question after waiting a little first he said has the english gentleman got it about him the boy answered also after waiting a little first yes the indian put a third and last question will the english gentleman come here as he has promised to come at the close of day the boy said i can't tell the indian asked why the boy said i am tired the mist rises in my head and puzzles me i can see no more to day with that the catechism ended the chief indian said something in his own language to the other two pointing to the boy and pointing towards the town in which as we afterwards discovered they were lodged he then after making more signs on the boy's head blew on his forehead and so woke him up with a start after that they all went on their way towards the town and the girls saw them no more most things they say have a moral if you only look for it what was the moral of this the moral was as i thought first that the chief juggler had heard mr franklin's arrival talked of among the servants out of doors and saw his way to making a little money by it second that he and his men and boy with a view to making the said money meant to hang about till they saw my lady drive home and then to come back and foretell mr franklin's arrival by magic third that penelope had heard them rehearsing their hocus pocus like actors rehearsing a play fourth that i should do well to have an eye that evening on the plate basket fifth that penelope would do well to cool down and leave me her father to doze off again in the sun that appeared to me to be the sensible view if you know anything of the ways of young women you won't be surprised to hear that penelope wouldn't take it the moral of the thing was serious according to my daughter she particularly reminded me of the indian's third question has the english gentleman got it about him oh father says penelope clasping her hands don't joke about this what does it mean we'll ask mr franklin my dear i said if you can wait till mr franklin comes i winked to show i meant that in joke penelope took it quite seriously my girl's earnestness tickled me what on earth should mr franklin know about it i inquired ask him says penelope and see whether he thinks it a laughing matter too with that parting shot my daughter left me i settled it with myself when she was gone that i really would ask mr franklin mainly to set penelope's mind at rest what was said between us when i did ask him later on that same day you will find set out fully in its proper place but as i don't wish to raise your expectations and then disappoint them i will take leave to warn you here before we go any further that you won't find the ghost of a joke in our conversation on the subject of the jugglers to my great surprise mr franklin like penelope took the thing seriously how seriously you will understand when i tell you that in his opinion it meant the moonstone chapter iv i am truly sorry to detain you over me and my beehive chair a sleepy old man in a sunny back yard is not an interesting object i am well aware but things must be put down in their places as things actually happened and you must please to jog on a little while longer with me in expectation of mr franklin blake's arrival later in the day before i had time to doze off again after my daughter penelope had left me i was disturbed by a rattling of plates and dishes in the servants hall which meant that dinner was ready taking my own meals in my own sitting room i had nothing to do with the servants dinner except to wish them a good stomach to it all round previous to composing myself once more in my chair i was just stretching my legs when out bounced another woman on me not my daughter again only nancy the kitchen maid this time i was straight in her way out and i observed as she asked me to let her by that she had a sulky face a thing which as head of the servants i never allow on principle to pass me without inquiry what are you turning your back on your dinner for i asked what's wrong now nancy nancy tried to push by without answering upon which i rose up and took her by the ear she is a nice plump young lass and it is customary with me to adopt that manner of showing that i personally approve of a girl what's wrong now i said once more rosanna's late again for dinner says nancy and i'm sent to fetch her in all the hard work falls on my shoulders in this house let me alone mr betteredge the person here mentioned as rosanna was our second housemaid having a kind of pity for our second housemaid why you shall presently know and seeing in nancy's face that she would fetch her fellow servant in with more hard words than might be needful under the circumstances it struck me that i had nothing particular to do and that i might as well fetch rosanna myself giving her a hint to be punctual in future which i knew she would take kindly from me where is rosanna i inquired at the sands of course says nancy with a toss of her head she had another of her fainting fits this morning and she asked to go out and get a breath of fresh air i have no patience with her go back to your dinner my girl i said i have patience with her and i'll fetch her in nancy who has a fine appetite looked pleased when she looks pleased she looks nice when she looks nice i chuck her under the chin it isn't immorality it's only habit well i took my stick and set off for the sands no it won't do to set off yet i am sorry again to detain you but you really must hear the story of the sands and the story of rosanna for this reason that the matter of the diamond touches them both nearly how hard i try to get on with my statement without stopping by the way and how badly i succeed but there persons and things do turn up so vexatiously in this life and will in a manner insist on being noticed let us take it easy and let us take it short we shall be in the thick of the mystery soon i promise you rosanna to put the person before the thing which is but common politeness was the only new servant in our house about four months before the time i am writing of my lady had been in london and had gone over a reformatory intended to save forlorn women from drifting back into bad ways after they had got released from prison the matron seeing my lady took an interest in the place pointed out a girl to her named rosanna spearman and told her a most miserable story which i haven't the heart to repeat here for i don't like to be made wretched without any use and no more do you the upshot of it was that rosanna spearman had been a thief and not being of the sort that get up companies in the city and rob from thousands instead of only robbing from one the law laid hold of her and the prison and the reformatory followed the lead of the law the matron's opinion of rosanna was in spite of what she had done that the girl was one in a thousand and that she only wanted a chance to prove herself worthy of any christian woman's interest in her my lady being a christian woman if ever there was one yet said to the matron upon that rosanna spearman shall have her chance in my service in a week afterwards rosanna spearman entered this establishment as our second housemaid not a soul was told the girl's story excepting miss rachel and me my lady doing me the honour to consult me about most things consulted me about rosanna having fallen a good deal latterly into the late sir john's way of always agreeing with my lady i agreed with her heartily about rosanna spearman a fairer chance no girl could have had than was given to this poor girl of ours none of the servants could cast her past life in her teeth for none of the servants knew what it had been she had her wages and her privileges like the rest of them and every now and then a friendly word from my lady in private to encourage her in return she showed herself i am bound to say well worthy of the kind treatment bestowed upon her though far from strong and troubled occasionally with those fainting fits already mentioned she went about her work modestly and uncomplainingly doing it carefully and doing it well but somehow she failed to make friends among the other women servants excepting my daughter penelope who was always kind to rosanna though never intimate with her i hardly know what the girl did to offend them there was certainly no beauty about her to make the others envious she was the plainest woman in the house with the additional misfortune of having one shoulder bigger than the other what the servants chiefly resented i think was her silent tongue and her solitary ways she read or worked in leisure hours when the rest gossiped and when it came to her turn to go out nine times out of ten she quietly put on her bonnet and had her turn by herself she never quarrelled she never took offence she only kept a certain distance obstinately and civilly between the rest of them and herself add to this that plain as she was there was just a dash of something that wasn't like a housemaid and that was like a lady about her it might have been in her voice or it might have been in her face all i can say is that the other women pounced on it like lightning the first day she came into the house and said which was most unjust that rosanna spearman gave herself airs having now told the story of rosanna i have only to notice one of the many queer ways of this strange girl to get on next to the story of the sands our house is high up on the yorkshire coast and close by the sea we have got beautiful walks all round us in every direction but one that one i acknowledge to be a horrid walk it leads for a quarter of a mile through a melancholy plantation of firs and brings you out between low cliffs on the loneliest and ugliest little bay on all our coast the sand hills here run down to the sea and end in two spits of rock jutting out opposite each other till you lose sight of them in the water one is called the north spit and one the south between the two shifting backwards and forwards at certain seasons of the year lies the most horrible quicksand on the shores of yorkshire at the turn of the tide something goes on in the unknown deeps below which sets the whole face of the quicksand shivering and trembling in a manner most remarkable to see and which has given to it among the people in our parts the name of the shivering sand a great bank half a mile out nigh the mouth of the bay breaks the force of the main ocean coming in from the offing winter and summer when the tide flows over the quicksand the sea seems to leave the waves behind it on the bank and rolls its waters in smoothly with a heave and covers the sand in silence a lonesome and a horrid retreat i can tell you no boat ever ventures into this bay no children from our fishing village called cobb's hole ever come here to play the very birds of the air as it seems to me give the shivering sand a wide berth that a young woman with dozens of nice walks to choose from and company to go with her if she only said come should prefer this place and should sit and work or read in it all alone when it's her turn out i grant you passes belief it's true nevertheless account for it as you may that this was rosanna spearman's favourite walk except when she went once or twice to cobb's hole to see the only friend she had in our neighbourhood of whom more anon it's also true that i was now setting out for this same place to fetch the girl in to dinner which brings us round happily to our former point and starts us fair again on our way to the sands i saw no sign of the girl in the plantation when i got out through the sand hills on to the beach there she was in her little straw bonnet and her plain grey cloak that she always wore to hide her deformed shoulder as much as might be there she was all alone looking out on the quicksand and the sea she started when i came up with her and turned her head away from me not looking me in the face being another of the proceedings which as head of the servants i never allow on principle to pass without inquiry i turned her round my way and saw that she was crying my bandanna handkerchief one of six beauties given to me by my lady was handy in my pocket i took it out and i said to rosanna come and sit down my dear on the slope of the beach along with me i'll dry your eyes for you first and then i'll make so bold as to ask what you have been crying about when you come to my age you will find sitting down on the slope of a beach a much longer job than you think it now by the time i was settled rosanna had dried her own eyes with a very inferior handkerchief to mine cheap cambric she looked very quiet and very wretched but she sat down by me like a good girl when i told her when you want to comfort a woman by the shortest way take her on your knee i thought of this golden rule but there rosanna wasn't nancy and that's the truth of it now tell me my dear i said what are you crying about about the years that are gone mr betteredge says rosanna quietly my past life still comes back to me sometimes come come my girl i said your past life is all sponged out why can't you forget it she took me by one of the lappets of my coat i am a slovenly old man and a good deal of my meat and drink gets splashed about on my clothes sometimes one of the women and sometimes another cleans me of my grease the day before rosanna had taken out a spot for me on the lappet of my coat with a new composition warranted to remove anything the grease was gone but there was a little dull place left on the nap of the cloth where the grease had been the girl pointed to that place and shook her head the stain is taken off she said"
