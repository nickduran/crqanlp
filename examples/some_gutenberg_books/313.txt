"1" "that sounded half confused and half amazed he dodged and i have never seen him since for a book by thomas hardy with searching feet through dark circuitous ways i plunged and stumbled round me far and near quaint hordes of eyeless phantoms did appear twisting and turning in a bootless chase when like an exile given by god's grace to feel once more a human atmosphere i caught the world's first murmur large and clear flung from a singing river's endless race then through a magic twilight from below i heard its grand sad song as in a dream life's wild infinity of mirth and woe it sang me and with many a changing gleam across the music of its onward flow i saw the cottage lights of wessex beam thomas hood the man who cloaked his bitterness within this winding sheet of puns and pleasantries god never gave to look with common eyes upon a world of anguish and of sin his brother was the branded man of lynn and there are woven with his jollities the nameless and eternal tragedies that render hope and hopelessness akin we laugh and crown him but anon we feel a still chord sorrow swept a weird unrest and thin dim shadows home to midnight steal as if the very ghost of mirth were dead as if the joys of time to dreams had fled or sailed away with ines to the west the miracle dear brother dearest friend when i am dead and you shall see no more this face of mine let nothing but red roses be the sign of the white life i lost for him she said no do not curse him pity him instead forgive him forgive me god's anodyne for human hate is pity and the wine that makes men wise forgiveness i have read love's message in love's murder and i die and so they laid her just where she would lie under red roses red they bloomed and fell but when flushed autumn and the snows went by and spring came lo from every bud's green shell burst a white blossom can love reason why horace to leuconoe i pray you not leuconoe to pore with unpermitted eyes on what may be appointed by the gods for you and me nor on chaldean figures any more t were infinitely better to implore the present only whether jove decree more winters yet to come or whether he make even this whose hard wave eaten shore shatters the tuscan seas to day the last be wise withal and rack your wine nor fill your bosom with large hopes for while i sing the envious close of time is narrowing so seize the day or ever it be past and let the morrow come for what it will reuben bright because he was a butcher and thereby did earn an honest living and did right i would not have you think that reuben bright was any more a brute than you or i for when they told him that his wife must die he stared at them and shook with grief and fright and cried like a great baby half that night and made the women cry to see him cry and after she was dead and he had paid the singers and the sexton and the rest he packed a lot of things that she had made most mournfully away in an old chest of hers and put some chopped up cedar boughs in with them and tore down the slaughter house the altar alone remote nor witting where i went i found an altar builded in a dream a fiery place whereof there was a gleam so swift so searching and so eloquent of upward promise that love's murmur blent with sorrow's warning gave but a supreme unending impulse to that human stream whose flood was all for the flame's fury bent alas i said the world is in the wrong but the same quenchless fever of unrest that thrilled the foremost of that martyred throng thrilled me and i awoke and was the same bewildered insect plunging for the flame that burns and must burn somehow for the best the tavern whenever i go by there nowadays and look at the rank weeds and the strange grass the torn blue curtains and the broken glass i seem to be afraid of the old place and something stiffens up and down my face for all the world as if i saw the ghost of old ham amory the murdered host with his dead eyes turned on me all aglaze the tavern has a story but no man can tell us what it is we only know that once long after midnight years ago a stranger galloped up from tilbury town who brushed and scared and all but overran that skirt crazed reprobate john evereldown sonnet oh for a poet for a beacon bright to rift this changeless glimmer of dead gray to spirit back the muses long astray and flush parnassus with a newer light to put these little sonnet men to flight who fashion in a shrewd mechanic way songs without souls that flicker for a day to vanish in irrevocable night what does it mean this barren age of ours here are the men the women and the flowers the seasons and the sunset as before what does it mean shall not one bard arise to wrench one banner from the western skies and mark it with his name forevermore george crabbe give him the darkest inch your shelf allows hide him in lonely garrets if you will but his hard human pulse is throbbing still with the sure strength that fearless truth endows in spite of all fine science disavows of his plain excellence and stubborn skill there yet remains what fashion cannot kill though years have thinned the laurel from his brows whether or not we read him we can feel from time to time the vigor of his name against us like a finger for the shame and emptiness of what our souls reveal in books that are as altars where we kneel to consecrate the flicker not the flame credo i cannot find my way there is no star in all the shrouded heavens anywhere and there is not a whisper in the air of any living voice but one so far that i can hear it only as a bar of lost imperial music played when fair and angel fingers wove and unaware dead leaves to garlands where no roses are no there is not a glimmer nor a call for one that welcomes welcomes when he fears the black and awful chaos of the night for through it all above beyond it all i know the far sent message of the years i feel the coming glory of the light on the night of a friend's wedding if ever i am old and all alone i shall have killed one grief at any rate for then thank god i shall not have to wait much longer for the sheaves that i have sown the devil only knows what i have done but here i am and here are six or eight good friends who most ingenuously prate about my songs to such and such a one but everything is all askew to night as if the time were come or almost come for their untenanted mirage of me to lose itself and crumble out of sight like a tall ship that floats above the foam a little while and then breaks utterly sonnet the master and the slave go hand in hand though touch be lost the poet is a slave and there be kings do sorrowfully crave the joyance that a scullion may command but ah the sonnet slave must understand the mission of his bondage or the grave may clasp his bones or ever he shall save the perfect word that is the poet's wand the sonnet is a crown whereof the rhymes are for thought's purest gold the jewel stones but shapes and echoes that are never done will haunt the workshop as regret sometimes will bring with human yearning to sad thrones the crash of battles that are never won verlaine why do you dig like long clawed scavengers to touch the covered corpse of him that fled the uplands for the fens and rioted like a sick satyr with doom's worshippers come let the grass grow there and leave his verse to tell the story of the life he led let the man go let the dead flesh be dead and let the worms be its biographers song sloughs away the sin to find redress in art's complete remembrance nothing clings for long but laurel to the stricken brow that felt the muse's finger nothing less than hell's fulfilment of the end of things can blot the star that shines on paris now sonnet when we can all so excellently give the measure of love's wisdom with a blow why can we not in turn receive it so and end this murmur for the life we live and when we do so frantically strive to win strange faith why do we shun to know that in love's elemental over glow god's wholeness gleams with light superlative oh brother men if you have eyes at all look at a branch a bird a child a rose or anything god ever made that grows nor let the smallest vision of it slip till you can read as on belshazzar's wall the glory of eternal partnership supremacy there is a drear and lonely tract of hell from all the common gloom removed afar a flat sad land it is where shadows are whose lorn estate my verse may never tell i walked among them and i knew them well men i had slandered on life's little star for churls and sluggards and i knew the scar upon their brows of woe ineffable but as i went majestic on my way into the dark they vanished one by one till with a shaft of god's eternal day the dream of all my glory was undone and with a fool's importunate dismay i heard the dead men singing in the sun the night before look you dominie look you and listen look in my face first search every line there mark every feature chin lip and forehead look in my eyes and tell me the lesson you read there measure my nose and tell me where i am wanting a man's nose dominie is often the cast of his inward spirit so mark mine well but why do you smile so pity or what is it written all over this face of mine with a brute's confession nothing but sin there nothing but hell scars or is it because there is something better a glimmer of good maybe or a shadow of something that's followed me down from childhood followed me all these years and kept me spite of my slips and sins and follies spite of my last red sin my murder just out of hell yes something of that kind and you smile for that you're a good man dominie the one good man in the world who knows me my one good friend in a world that mocks me here in this hard stone cage but i leave it to morrow to morrow my god am i crying are these things tears tears what am i frightened i who swore i should go to the scaffold with big strong steps and no more i thank you but no i am all right now no listen i am here to be hanged to be hanged to morrow at six o'clock when the sun is rising and why am i here not a soul can tell you but this poor shivering thing before you this fluttering wreck of the man god made him for god knows what wild reason hear me and learn from my lips the truth of my story there's nothing strange in what i shall tell you nothing mysterious nothing unearthly but damnably human and you shall hear it not one of those little black lawyers had guessed it the judge with his big bald head never knew it and the jury god rest their poor souls never dreamed it once there were three in the world who could tell it now there are two there'll be two to morrow you my friend and but there's the story when i was a boy the world was heaven i never knew then that the men and the women who petted and called me a brave big fellow were ever less happy than i but wisdom which comes with the years you know soon showed me the secret of all my glittering childhood the broken key to the fairies castle that held my life in the fresh glad season when i was the king of the earth then slowly and yet so swiftly there came the knowledge that the marvellous life i had lived was my life that the glorious world i had loved was my world and that every man and every woman and every child was a different being wrought with a different heat and fired with passions born of a single spirit that the pleasure i felt was not their pleasure nor my sorrow a kind of nameless pity for something i knew not what their sorrow and thus was i taught my first hard lesson the lesson we suffer the most in learning that a happy man is a man forgetful of all the torturing ills around him when or where i first met the woman i cherished and made my wife no matter enough to say that i found her and kept her here in my heart with as pure a devotion as ever christ felt for his brothers forgive me for naming his name in your patient presence but i feel my words and the truth i utter is god's own truth i loved that woman not for her face but for something fairer something diviner i thought than beauty i loved the spirit the human something that seemed to chime with my own condition and make soul music when we were together and we were never apart from the moment my eyes flashed into her eyes the message that swept itself in a quivering answer back through my strange lost being my pulses leapt with an aching speed and the measure of this great world grew small and smaller till it seemed the sky and the land and the ocean closed at last in a mist all golden around us two and we stood for a season like gods outflung from chaos dreaming that we were the king and the queen of the fire that reddened the clouds of love that held us blind to the new world soon to be ours ours to seize and sway the passion of that great love was a nameless passion bright as the blaze of the sun at noonday wild as the flames of hell but mark you never a whit less pure for its fervor the baseness in me for i was human burned like a worm and perished and nothing was left me then but a soul that mingled itself with hers and swayed and shuddered in fearful triumph when i consider that helpless love and the cursed folly that wrecked my life for the sake of a woman who broke with a laugh the chains of her marriage whatever the word may mean i wonder if all the woe was her sin or whether the chains themselves were enough to lead her in love's despite to break them sinners and saints i say are rocked in the cradle but never are known till the will within them speaks in its own good time so i foster even to night for the woman who wronged me nothing of hate nor of love but a feeling of still regret for the man but hear me and judge for yourself for a time the seasons changed and passed in a sweet succession that seemed to me like an endless music life was a rolling psalm and the choirs of god were glad for our love i fancied all this and more than i dare to tell you to night yes more than i dare to remember and then well the music stopped there are moments in all men's lives when it stops i fancy or seems to stop till it comes to cheer them again with a larger sound the curtain of life just then is lifted a little to give to their sight new joys new sorrows or nothing at all sometimes i was watching the slow sweet scenes of a golden picture flushed and alive with a long delusion that made the murmur of home when i shuddered and felt like a knife that awful silence that comes when the music goes forever the truth came over my life like a darkness over a forest where one man wanders worse than alone for a time i staggered and stumbled on with a weak persistence after the phantom of hope that darted and dodged like a frightened thing before me to quit me at last and vanish nothing was left me then but the curse of living and bearing through all my days the fever and thirst of a poisoned love were i stronger or weaker perhaps my scorn had saved me given me strength to crush my sorrow with hate for her and the world that praised her to have left her then and there to have conquered that old false life with a new and a wiser such things are easy in words you listen and frown i suppose that i never mention that beautiful word forgive i forgave her first of all and i praised kind heaven that i was a brave clean man to do it and then i tried to forget forgiveness what does it mean when the one forgiven shivers and weeps and clings and kisses the credulous fool that holds her and tells him a thousand things of a good man's mercy and then slips off with a laugh and plunges back to the sin she has quit for a season to tell him that hell and the world are better for her than a prophet's heaven believe me the love that dies ere its flames are wasted in search of an alien soul is better better by far than the lonely passion that burns back into the heart that feeds it for i loved her still and the more she mocked me fooled with her endless pleading promise of future faith the more i believed her the penitent thing she seemed and the stronger her choking arms and her small hot kisses bound me and burned my brain to pity the more she grew to the heavenly creature that brightened the life i had lost forever the truth was gone somehow for the moment the curtain fell for a time and i fancied we were again like gods together loving again with the old glad rapture but scenes like these too often repeated failed at last and her guile was wasted i made an end of her shrewd caresses and told her a few straight words she took them full at their worth and the farce was over at first my dreams of the past upheld me but they were a short support the present pushed them away and i fell the mission of life whatever it was was blasted my game was lost and i met the winner of that foul deal as a sick slave gathers his painful strength at the sight of his master and when he was past i cursed him fearful of that strange chance which makes us mighty or mean or both i cursed him and hated the stones he pressed with his heel i followed his easy march with a backward envy and cursed myself for the beast within me but pride is the master of love and the vision of those old days grew faint and fainter the counterfeit wife my mercy sheltered was nothing now but a woman a woman out of my way and out of my nature my battle with blinded love was over my battle with aching pride beginning if i was the loser at first i wonder if i am the winner now i doubt it my life is a losing game and to morrow to morrow christ did i say to morrow is your brandy good for death there listen when love goes out and a man is driven to shun mankind for the scars that make him a joke for all chattering tongues he carries a double burden the woes i suffered after that hard betrayal made me pity at first all breathing creatures on this bewildered earth i studied their faces and made for myself the story of all their scattered lives like brothers and sisters they seemed to me then and i nourished a stranger friendship wrought in my fancy between those people and me but somehow as time went on there came queer glances out of their eyes and the shame that stung me harassed my pride with a crazed impression that every face in the surging city was turned to me and i saw sly whispers now and then as i walked and wearied my wasted life twice over in bearing with all my sorrow the sorrows of others till i found myself their fool then i trembled a poor scared thing and their prying faces told me the ghastly truth they were laughing at me and my fate my god i could feel it that laughter and then the children caught it and i like a struck dog crept and listened and then when i met the man who had weakened a woman's love to his own desire it seemed to me that all hell were laughing in fiendish concert i was their victim and his and hate's and there was the struggle as long as the earth we tread holds something a tortured heart can love the meaning of life is not wholly blurred but after the last loved thing in the world has left us we know the triumph of hate the glory of good goes out forever the beacon of sin is the light that leads us downward down to the fiery end the road runs right through hell and the souls that follow the cursed ways where its windings lead them suffer enough i say to merit all grace that a god can give the fashion of our belief is to lift all beings born for a life that knows no struggle in sin's tight snares to eternal glory all apart from the branded millions who carry through life their faces graven with sure brute scars that tell the story of their foul fated passions science has yet no salve to smooth or soften the cradle scars of a tyrant's visage no drug to purge from the vital essence of souls the sleeping venom virtue may flower in hell when its roots are twisted and wound with the roots of vice but the stronger never is known till there comes that battle with sin to prove the victor perilous things are these demons we call our passions slaves are we of their roving fancies fools of their devilish glee you think me i know in this maundering way designing to lighten the load of my guilt and cast it half on the shoulders of god but hear me i'm partly a man for all my weakness if weakness it were to stand and murder before men's eyes the man who had murdered me and driven my burning forehead with horns for the world to laugh at trust me and try to believe my words but a portion of what god's purpose made me the coward within me cries for this and i beg you now as i come to the end to remember that women and men are on earth to travel all on a different road hereafter the roads may meet i trust in something i know not what well this was the way of it stung with the shame and the secret fury that comes to the man who has thrown his pittance of self at a traitor's feet i wandered weeks and weeks in a baffled frenzy till at last the devil spoke i heard him and laughed at the love that strove to touch me the dead lost love and i gripped the demon close to my breast and held him praising the fates and the furies that gave me the courage to follow his wild command forgetful of all to come when the work was over there came to me then no stony vision of these three hundred days i cherished an awful joy in my brain i pondered and weighed the thing in my mind and gloried in life to think that i was to conquer death at his own dark door and chuckled to think of it done so cleanly one evening i knew that my time had come i shuddered a little but rather for doubt than terror and followed him led by the nameless devil i worshipped and called my brother the city shone like a dream that night the windows flashed with a piercing flame and the pavements pulsed and swayed with a warmth or something that seemed so then to my feet and thrilled me with a quick dizzy joy and the women and men like marvellous things of magic floated and laughed and sang by my shoulder sent with a wizard motion through it and over and under it all there sounded a murmur of life like bees and i listened and laughed again to think of the flower that grew blood red for me this fellow was one of the popular sort who flourish unruffled where gods would fall for a conscience he carried a snug deceit that made him the man of the time and the place whatever the time or the place might be were he sounding with a genial craft that cloaked its purpose nigh to itself the depth of a woman fooled with his brainless art or sending the midnight home with songs and bottles the cad was there and his ease forever shone with the smooth and slippery polish that tells the snake that night he drifted into an up town haunt and ordered whatever it was with a soft assurance that made me mad as i stood behind him gripping his death and waited coward i think is the name the world has given to men like me but i'll swear i never thought of my own disgrace when i shot him yes in the back i know it i know it now but what if i do as i watched him lying there dead in the scattered sawdust wet with a day's blown froth i noted that things were still that the walnut tables where men but a moment before were sitting were gone that a screen of something around me shut them out of my sight but the gilded signs of a hundred beers and whiskeys flashed from the walls above and the mirrors and glasses behind the bar were lighted in some strange way and into my spirit a thousand shafts of terrible fire burned like death and i fell the story of what came then you know but tell me what does the whole thing mean what are we slaves of an awful ignorance puppets pulled by a fiend or gods without knowing it do we shut from ourselves our own salvation or what do we do i tell you dominie there are times in the lives of us poor devils when heaven and hell get mixed though conscience may come like a whisper of christ to warn us away from our sins it is lost or laughed at and then we fall and for all who have fallen even for him i hold no malice nor much compassion a mightier mercy than mine must shrive him and i i am going into the light or into the darkness why do i sit through these sickening hours and hope good god are they hours hours yes i am done with days and to morrow we two may meet to morrow to morrow walt whitman the master songs are ended and the man that sang them is a name and so is god a name and so is love and life and death and everything but we who are too blind to read what we have written or what faith has written for us do not understand we only blink and wonder last night it was the song that was the man but now it is the man that is the song we do not hear him very much to day his piercing and eternal cadence rings too pure for us too powerfully pure too lovingly triumphant and too large but there are some that hear him and they know that he shall sing to morrow for all men and that all time shall listen the master songs are ended rather say no songs are ended that are ever sung and that no names are dead names when we write men's letters on proud marble or on sand we write them there forever the chorus of old men in aegeus ye gods that have a home beyond the world ye that have eyes for all man's agony"
