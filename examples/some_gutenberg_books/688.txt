"1" "one comes to the stretch of heavy sand that lies between pass christian proper and henderson's point this is a hard pull for the mules and the more ambitious riders get out and walk then after a final strain through the shifting sands bravo the shell road is reached and one goes cheering through the pine trees to henderson's point if ever you go to pass christian you must have a fish fry at henderson's point it is the pine thicketed white beached peninsula jutting out from the land with one side caressed by the waters of the sound and the other purred over by the blue waves of the bay of st louis here is the beginning of the great three mile trestle bridge to the town of bay st louis and to night from the beach could be seen the lights of the villas glittering across the bay like myriads of unsleeping eyes here upon a firm stretch of white sand camped the merry makers soon a great fire of driftwood and pine cones tossed its flames defiantly at a radiant moon in the sky and the fishers were casting their nets in the sea the more daring of the girls waded bare legged in the water holding pine torches spearing flounders and peering for soft shell crabs annette had wandered farther in the shallow water than the rest suddenly she stumbled against a stone the torch dropped and spluttered at her feet with a little helpless cry she looked at the stretch of unfamiliar beach and water to find herself all alone pardon me mademoiselle said a voice at her elbow you are in distress it was her fisherman and with a scarce conscious sigh of relief annette put her hand into the outstretched one at her side i was looking for soft shells she explained and lost the crowd and now my torch is out where is the crowd there was some amusement in the tone and annette glanced up quickly prepared to be thoroughly indignant at this fisherman who dared make fun at her but there was such a kindly look about his mouth that she was reassured and said meekly at henderson's point you have wandered a half mile away he mused and have nothing to show for your pains but very wet skirts if mademoiselle will permit me i will take her to her friends but allow me to suggest that mademoiselle will leave the water and walk on the sands but i am barefoot wailed annette and i am afraid of the fiddlers fiddler crabs you know aren't pleasant things to be dangling around one's bare feet and they are more numerous than sand fleas down at henderson's point true assented the fisherman then we shall have to wade back the fishing was over when they rounded the point and came in sight of the cheery bonfire with its rembrandt like group and the air was savoury with the smell of frying fish and crabs the fisherman was not to be tempted by appeals to stay but smilingly disappeared down the sands the red glare of his torch making a glowing track in the water ah mees annette whispered natalie between mouthfuls of a rich croaker you have found a beau in the water and the fisherman of the pass too laughed her cousin ida annette tossed her head for philip had growled audibly do you know philip cried annette a few days after rudely shaking him from his siesta on the gallery do you know that i have found my fisherman's hut hum was the only response yes and it's the quaintest most delightful spot imaginable philip do come with me and see it hum oh philip you are so lazy do come with me yes but my dear annette protested philip this is a warm day and i am tired still his curiosity being aroused he went grumbling it was not a very long drive back from the beach across the railroad and through the pine forest to the bank of a dark slow flowing bayou the fisherman's hut was small two roomed whitewashed pine boarded with the traditional mud chimney acting as a sort of support to one of its uneven sides within was a weird assortment of curios from every uncivilized part of the globe also were there fishing tackle and guns in reckless profusion the fisherman in the kitchen of the mud chimney was sardonically waging war with a basket of little bayou crabs entrez mademoiselle et monsieur he said pleasantly grabbing a vicious crab by its flippers and smiling at its wild attempts to bite you see i am busy but make yourself at home well how on earth began philip sh sh whispered annette i was driving out in the woods this morning and stumbled on the hut he asked me in but i came right over after you the fisherman having succeeded in getting the last crab in the kettle of boiling water came forward smiling and began to explain the curios then you have not always lived at pass christian said philip mais non monsieur i am spending a summer here and he spends his winters doubtless selling fish in the french market spitefully soliloquised philip the fisherman was looking unutterable things into annette's eyes and it seemed to philip taking an unconscionably long time explaining the use of an east indian stiletto oh wouldn't it be delightful came from annette at last what asked philip why monsieur leconte says he'll take six of us out in his catboat tomorrow for a fishing trip on the gulf hum drily and i'll get natalie and her cousins yes still more drily annette chattered on entirely oblivious of the strainedness of the men's adieux and still chattered as they drove through the pines i did not know that you were going to take fishermen and marchands into the bosom of your social set when you came here growled philip at last but cousin phil can't you see he is a gentleman the fact that he makes no excuses or protestations is a proof you are a fool was the polite response still at six o'clock next morning there was a little crowd of seven upon the pier laughing and chatting at the little virginie dipping her bows in the water and flapping her sails in the brisk wind natalie's pink bonnet blushed in the early sunshine and natalie's mamma comely and portly did chaperonage duty it was not long before the sails gave swell into the breeze and the little boat scurried to the sound past the lighthouse on its gawky iron stalls she flew and now rounded the white sands of cat island bravo the gulf sang a voice on the lookout the little boat dipped halted an instant then rushed fast into the blue gulf waters we will anchor here said the host have luncheon and fish philip could not exactly understand why the fisherman should sit so close to annette and whisper so much into her ears he chafed at her acting the part of hostess and was possessed of a murderous desire to throw the pink sun bonnet and its owner into the sea when natalie whispered audibly to one of her cousins that mees annette act nice wit her lovare the sun was banking up flaming pillars of rose and gold in the west when the little virginie rounded cat island on her way home and the quick southern twilight was fast dying into darkness when she was tied up to the pier and the merry makers sprang off with baskets of fish annette had distinguished herself by catching one small shark and had immediately ceased to fish and devoted her attention to her fisherman and his line philip had angled fiercely landing trout croakers sheepshead snappers in bewildering luck he had broken each hopeless captive's neck savagely as though they were personal enemies he did not look happy as they landed though paeans of praise were being sung in his honour as the days passed on the fisherman of the pass began to dance attendance on annette what had seemed a joke became serious aunt nina urged by philip remonstrated and even the mamma of the pink sunbonnet began to look grave it was all very well for a city demoiselle to talk with a fisherman and accept favours at his hands provided that the city demoiselle understood that a vast and bridgeless gulf stretched between her and the fisherman but when the demoiselle forgot the gulf and the fisherman refused to recognise it why it was time to take matters in hand to all of aunt nina's remonstrances philip's growlings and the averted glances of her companions annette was deaf you are narrow minded she said laughingly i am interested in monsieur leconte simply as a study he is entertaining he talks well of his travels and as for refusing to recognise the difference between us why he never dreamed of such a thing suddenly a peremptory summons home from annette's father put an end to the fears of philip annette pouted but papa must be obeyed she blamed philip and aunt nina for telling tales but aunt nina was uncommunicative and philip too obviously cheerful to derive much satisfaction from that night she walked with the fisherman hand in hand on the sands the wind from the pines bore the scarcely recognisable subtle freshness of early autumn and the waters had a hint of dying summer in their sob on the beach you will remember said the fisherman that i have told you nothing about myself yes murmured annette and you will keep your promises to me yes let me hear you repeat them again i promise you that i will not forget you i promise you that i will never speak of you to anyone until i see you again i promise that i will then clasp your hand wherever you may be and mademoiselle will not be discouraged but will continue her studies yes it was all very romantic by the waves of the sound under a harvest moon that seemed all sympathy for these two despite the fact that it was probably looking down upon hundreds of other equally romantic couples annette went to bed with glowing cheeks and a heart whose pulsations would have caused a physician to prescribe unlimited digitalis it was still hot in new orleans when she returned home and it seemed hard to go immediately to work but if one is going to be an opera singer some day and capture the world with one's voice there is nothing to do but to study study sing practise even though one's throat be parched one's head a great ache and one's heart a nest of discouragement and sadness at what seems the uselessness of it all annette had now a new incentive to work the fisherman had once praised her voice when she hummed a barcarole on the sands and he had insisted that there was power in its rich notes though the fisherman had showed no cause why he should be accepted as a musical critic annette had somehow respected his judgment and been accordingly elated it was the night of the opening of the opera there was the usual crush the glitter and confusing radiance of the brilliant audience annette with papa aunt nina and philip was late reaching her box the curtain was up and la juive was pouring forth defiance at her angry persecutors annette listened breathlessly in fancy she too was ringing her voice out to an applauding house her head unconsciously beat time to the music and one hand half held her cloak from her bare shoulders then eleazar appeared and the house rose at the end of his song encores it gave and bravos and cheers he bowed calmly swept his eyes over the tiers until they found annette where they rested in a half smile of recognition philip gasped annette nervously raising her glasses my fisherman yes an opera singer is better than a marchand drawled philip the curtain fell on the first act the house was won by the new tenor it called and recalled him before the curtain clearly he had sung his way into the hearts of his audience at once papa aunt nina said annette you must come behind the scenes with me i want you to meet him he is delightful you must come philip was bending ostentatiously over the girl in the next box papa and aunt nina consented to be dragged behind the scenes annette was well known for in hopes of some day being an occupant of one of the dressing rooms she had made friends with everyone connected with the opera eleazar received them still wearing his brown garb and patriarchal beard how you deceived me she laughed when the greetings and introductions were over i came to america early he smiled back at her and thought i'd try a little incognito at the pass i was not well you see it has been of great benefit to me i kept my promise she said in a lower tone thank you that also has helped me annette's teacher began to note a wonderful improvement in his pupil's voice never did a girl study so hard or practise so faithfully it was truly wonderful now and then annette would say to papa as if to reassure herself and when monsieur cherbart says i am ready to go to paris i may go papa and papa would say a certainly that would send her back to the piano with renewed ardour as for monsieur leconte he was the idol of new orleans seldom had there been a tenor who had sung himself so completely into the very hearts of a populace when he was billed the opera displayed standing room signs no matter what the other attractions in the city might be sometimes monsieur leconte delighted small audiences in annette's parlour when the hostess was in a perfect flutter of happiness not often you know for the leading tenor was in great demand at the homes of society queens do you know said annette petulantly one evening i wish for the old days at pass christian so do i he answered tenderly will you repeat them with me next summer if i only could she gasped still she might have been happy had it not been for madame dubeau madame dubeau the flute voiced leading soprano who wore the single dainty curl on her forehead and thrilled her audiences oftentimes more completely than the fisherman madame dubeau was la juive to his eleazar leonore to his manfred elsa to his lohengrin aida to his rhadames marguerite to his faust in brief madame dubeau was his opposite she caressed him as mignon pleaded with him as michaela died for him in les huguenots broke her heart for love of him in la favorite how could he help but love her annette asked herself how could he madame dubeau was beautiful and gifted and charming once she whispered her fears to him when there was the meagrest bit of an opportunity he laughed you don't understand little one he said tenderly the relations of professional people to each other are peculiar after you go to paris you will know still new orleans had built up its romance and gossiped accordingly have you heard the news whispered lola to annette leaning from her box at the opera one night the curtain had just gone up on herodias and for some reason or other the audience applauded with more warmth than usual there was a noticeable number of good humoured benignant smiles on the faces of the applauders no answered annette breathlessly no indeed lola i am going to paris next week i am so delighted i can't stop to think yes that is excellent said lola but all new orleans is smiling at the romance monsieur leconte and madame dubeau were quietly married last night but it leaked out this afternoon see all the applause she's receiving annette leaned back in her chair very white and still her box was empty after the first act and a quiet little tired voice that was almost too faint to be heard in the carriage on the way home said papa i don't think i care to go to paris after all m'sieu fortier's violin slowly one by one the lights in the french opera go out until there is but a single glimmer of pale yellow flickering in the great dark space a few moments ago all a glitter with jewels and the radiance of womanhood and a clash with music darkness now and silence and a great haunted hush over all save for the distant cheery voice of a stage hand humming a bar of the opera the glimmer of gas makes a halo about the bowed white head of a little old man putting his violin carefully away in its case with aged trembling nervous fingers old m'sieu fortier was the last one out every night outside the air was murky foggy gas and electricity were but faint splotches of light on the thick curtain of fog and mist around the opera was a mighty bustle of carriages and drivers and footmen with a car gaining headway in the street now and then a howling of names and numbers the laughter and small talk of cloaked society stepping slowly to its carriages and the more bourgeoisie vocalisation of the foot passengers who streamed along and hummed little bits of music the fog's denseness was confusing too and at one moment it seemed that the little narrow street would become inextricably choked and remain so until some mighty engine would blow the crowd into atoms it had been a crowded night from around toulouse street where led the entrance to the troisiemes from the grand stairway from the entrance to the quatriemes the human stream poured into the street nearly all with a song on their lips m'sieu fortier stood at the corner blinking at the beautiful ladies in their carriages he exchanged a hearty salutation with the saloon keeper at the corner then tenderly carrying his violin case he trudged down bourbon street a little old bent withered figure with shoulders shrugged up to keep warm as though the faded brown overcoat were not thick enough down on bayou road not so far from claiborne street was a house little and old and queer but quite large enough to hold m'sieu fortier a wrinkled dame and a white cat he was home but little for on nearly every day there were rehearsals then on tuesday thursday and saturday nights and twice sundays there were performances so ma'am jeanne and the white cat kept house almost always alone then when m'sieu fortier was at home why it was practice practice all the day and smoke snore sleep at night altogether it was not very exhilarating m'sieu fortier had played first violin in the orchestra ever since well no one remembered his not playing there sometimes there would come breaks in the seasons and for a year the great building would be dark and silent then m'sieu fortier would do jobs of playing here and there one night for this ball another night for that soiree dansante and in the day work at his trade that of a cigar maker but now for seven years there had been no break in the season and the little old violinist was happy there is nothing sweeter than a regular job and good music to play music into which one can put some soul some expression and which one must study to understand dance music of the frivolous frothy kind deemed essential to soirees is trivial easy uninteresting so m'sieu fortier ma'am jeanne and the white cat lived a peaceful uneventful existence out on bayou road when the opera season was over in february m'sieu went back to cigar making and the white cat purred none the less contentedly it had been a benefit to night for the leading tenor and he had chosen roland a ronceveaux a favourite this season for his farewell and mon dieu mused the little m'sieu but how his voice had rung out bell like piercing above the chorus of the first act encore after encore was given and the bravos of the troisiemes were enough to stir the most sluggish of pulses superbes pyrenees qui dressez dans le ciel vos cimes couronnees d'un hiver eternelle pour nous livrer passage ouvrez vos larges flancs faites faire l'orage voici venir les francs m'sieu quickened his pace down bourbon street as he sang the chorus to himself in a thin old voice and then before he could see in the thick fog he had run into two young men i i beg your pardon messieurs he stammered most certainly was the careless response then the speaker taking a second glance at the object of the rencontre cried joyfully oh m'sieu fortier is it you why you are so happy singing your love sonnet to your lady's eyebrow that you didn't see a thing but the moon did you and who is the fair one who should clog your senses so there was a deprecating shrug from the little man ma foi but monsieur must know fo sho dat i am too old for love songs i know nothing save that i want that violin of yours when is it to be mine m'sieu fortier nevare nevare exclaimed m'sieu gripping on as tightly to the case as if he feared it might be wrenched from him me a lovere and to sell mon violon ah so ver foolish martel said the first speaker to his companion as they moved on up town i wish you knew that little frenchman he's a unique specimen he has the most exquisite violin i've seen in years beautiful and mellow as a genuine cremona and he can make the music leap sing laugh sob skip wail anything you like from under his bow when he wishes it's something wonderful we are good friends picked him up in my french town rambles i've been trying to buy that instrument since to throw it aside a week later lazily inquired martel you are like the rest of these nineteenth century vandals you can see nothing picturesque that you do not wish to deface for a souvenir you cannot even let simple happiness alone but must needs destroy it in a vain attempt to make it your own or parade it as an advertisement as for m'sieu fortier he went right on with his song and turned into bayou road his shoulders still shrugged high as though he were cold and into the quaint little house where ma'am jeanne and the white cat who always waited up for him at nights were both nodding over the fire it was not long after this that the opera closed and m'sieu went back to his old out of season job but somehow he did not do as well this spring and summer as always there is a certain amount of cunning and finesse required to roll a cigar just so that m'sieu seemed to be losing whether from age or deterioration it was hard to tell nevertheless there was just about half as much money coming in as formerly and the quaint little pucker between m'sieu's eyebrows which served for a frown came oftener and stayed longer than ever before minesse he said one day to the white cat he told all his troubles to her it was of no use to talk to ma'am jeanne she was too deaf to understand minesse we are gettin po you pere git h'old an hees han's dey go no mo rapidement an dere be no mo soirees dese day minesse eef la saison don hurry up we shall eat ver lil meat and minesse curled her tail and purred before the summer had fairly begun strange rumours began to float about in musical circles m mauge would no longer manage the opera but it would be turned into the hands of americans a syndicate bah these english speaking people could do nothing unless there was a trust a syndicate a company immense and dishonest it was going to be a guarantee business with a strictly financial basis but worse than all this the new manager who was now in france would not only procure the artists but a new orchestra a new leader m'sieu fortier grew apprehensive at this for he knew what the loss of his place would mean to him september and october came and the papers were filled with accounts of the new artists from france and of the new orchestra leader too he was described as a most talented progressive energetic young man m'sieu fortier's heart sank at the word progressive he was anything but that the new orleans creole blood flowed too sluggishly in his old veins november came the opera reopened m'sieu fortier was not re engaged minesse he said with a catch in his voice that strongly resembled a sob minesse we mus go hongry sometime ah mon pauvre violon ah mon dieu dey put us h'out an dey will not have us nev min we will sing anyhow and drawing his bow across the strings he sang in his thin quavering voice salut demeure chaste et pure it is strange what a peculiar power of fascination former haunts have for the human mind the criminal after he has fled from justice steals back and skulks about the scene of his crime the employee thrown from work hangs about the place of his former industry the schoolboy truant or expelled peeps in at the school gate and taunts the good boys within m'sieu fortier was no exception night after night of the performances he climbed the stairs of the opera and sat an attentive listener to the orchestra with one ear inclined to the stage and a quizzical expression on his wrinkled face then he would go home and pat minesse and fondle the violin ah minesse dose new player not one bit can dey play such tones minesse such tones all the time portemento oh so ver bad ah mon chere violon we can play and he would play and sing a romance and smile tenderly to himself at first it used to be into the deuxiemes that m'sieu fortier went into the front seats but soon they were too expensive and after all one could hear just as well in the fourth row as in the first after a while even the rear row of the deuxiemes was too costly and the little musician wended his way with the plebeians around on toulouse street and climbed the long tedious flight of stairs into the troisiemes it makes no difference to be one row higher it was more to the liking after all one felt more at home up here among the people if one was thirsty one could drink a glass of wine or beer being passed about by the libretto boys and the music sounded just as well but it happened one night that m'sieu could not even afford to climb the toulouse street stairs to be sure there was yet another gallery the quatriemes where the peanut boys went for a dime but m'sieu could not get down to that yet so he stayed outside until all the beautiful women in their warm wraps a bright hued chattering throng came down the grand staircase to their carriages it was on one of these nights that courcey and martel found him shivering at the corner hello m'sieu fortier cried courcey are you ready to let me have that violin yet for shame interrupted martel fifty dollars you know continued courcey taking no heed of his friend's interpolation m'sieu fortier made a courtly bow eef monsieur will call at my ouse on de morrow he may have mon violon he said huskily then turned abruptly on his heel and went down bourbon street his shoulders drawn high as though he were cold when courcey and martel entered the gate of the little house on bayou road the next day there floated out to their ears a wordless song thrilling from the violin a song that told more than speech or tears or gestures could have done of the utter sorrow and desolation of the little old man they walked softly up the short red brick walk and tapped at the door within m'sieu fortier was caressing the violin with silent tears streaming down his wrinkled gray face there was not much said on either side courcey came away with the instrument leaving the money behind while martel grumbled at the essentially sordid mercenary spirit of the world m'sieu fortier turned back into the room after bowing his visitors out with old time french courtliness and turning to the sleepy white cat said with a dry sob minesse dere's only me an you now about six days later courcey's morning dreams were disturbed by the announcement of a visitor hastily doing a toilet he descended the stairs to find m'sieu fortier nervously pacing the hall floor i come fo bring back you money yaas i cannot sleep i cannot eat i only cry and t'ink and weesh fo mon violon and minesse an de ol woman too dey mope an look bad too all for mon violon i try fo to use dat money but eet burn an sting lak blood money i feel lak i done sol my child i cannot go at l'opera no mo i t'ink of mon violon i starve befo"
