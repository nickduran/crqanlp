"1" "tippet's mangled remains from the powerful jaws the men working for the most part silently it was the work of the banshee all right muttered brady it warned poor tippet it did hit killed him that's wot hit did hand hit'll kill some more of us said james his lower lip trembling if it was a ghost interjected sinclair and i don't say as it was but if it was why it could take on any form it wanted to it might have turned itself into this thing which ain't no natural thing at all just to get poor tippet if it had of been a lion or something else humanlike it wouldn't look so strange but this here thing ain't humanlike there ain't no such thing an never was bullets don't kill ghosts said bradley so this couldn't have been a ghost furthermore there are no such things i've been trying to place this creature just succeeded it's a tyrannosaurus saw picture of skeleton in magazine there's one in new york natural history museum seems to me it said it was found in place called hell creek somewhere in western north america supposed to have lived about six million years ago hell creek's in montana said sinclair i used to punch cows in wyoming an i've heard of hell creek do you s'pose that there thing's six million years old his tone was skeptical no replied bradley but it would indicate that the island of caprona has stood almost without change for more than six million years the conversation and bradley's assurance that the creature was not of supernatural origin helped to raise a trifle the spirits of the men and then came another diversion in the form of ravenous meat eaters attracted to the spot by the uncanny sense of smell which had apprised them of the presence of flesh killed and ready for the eating it was a constant battle while they dug a grave and consigned all that was mortal of john tippet to his last lonely resting place nor would they leave then but remained to fashion a rude headstone from a crumbling out cropping of sandstone and to gather a mass of the gorgeous flowers growing in such great profusion around them and heap the new made grave with bright blooms upon the headstone sinclair scratched in rude characters the words here lies john tippet englishman killed by tyrannosaurus 10 sept a.d 1916 r.i.p and bradley repeated a short prayer before they left their comrade forever for three days the party marched due south through forests and meadow land and great park like areas where countless herbivorous animals grazed deer and antelope and bos and the little ecca the smallest species of caspakian horse about the size of a rabbit there were other horses too but all were small the largest being not above eight hands in height preying continually upon the herbivora were the meat eaters large and small wolves hyaenodons panthers lions tigers and bears as well as several large and ferocious species of reptilian life on september twelfth the party scaled a line of sandstone cliffs which crossed their route toward the south but they crossed them only after an encounter with the tribe that inhabited the numerous caves which pitted the face of the escarpment that night they camped upon a rocky plateau which was sparsely wooded with jarrah and here once again they were visited by the weird nocturnal apparition that had already filled them with a nameless terror as on the night of september ninth the first warning came from the sentinel standing guard over his sleeping companions a terror stricken cry punctuated by the crack of a rifle brought bradley sinclair and brady to their feet in time to see james with clubbed rifle battling with a white robed figure that hovered on widespread wings on a level with the englishman's head as they ran shouting forward it was obvious to them that the weird and terrible apparition was attempting to seize james but when it saw the others coming to his rescue it desisted flapping rapidly upward and away its long ragged wings giving forth the peculiarly dismal notes which always characterized the sound of its flying bradley fired at the vanishing menacer of their peace and safety but whether he scored a hit or not none could tell though following the shot there was wafted back to them the same piercing wail that had on other occasions frozen their marrow then they turned toward james who lay face downward upon the ground trembling as with ague for a time he could not even speak but at last regained sufficient composure to tell them how the thing must have swooped silently upon him from above and behind as the first premonition of danger he had received was when the long clawlike fingers had clutched him beneath either arm in the melee his rifle had been discharged and he had broken away at the same instant and turned to defend himself with the butt the rest they had seen from that instant james was an absolutely broken man he maintained with shaking lips that his doom was sealed that the thing had marked him for its own and that he was as good as dead nor could any amount of argument or raillery convince him to the contrary he had seen tippet marked and claimed and now he had been marked nor were his constant reiterations of this belief without effect upon the rest of the party even bradley felt depressed though for the sake of the others he managed to hide it beneath a show of confidence he was far from feeling and on the following day william james was killed by a saber tooth tiger september 13 1916 beneath a jarrah tree on the stony plateau on the northern edge of the sto lu country in the land that time forgot he lies in a lonely grave marked by a rough headstone southward from his grave marched three grim and silent men to the best of bradley's reckoning they were some twenty five miles north of fort dinosaur and that they might reach the fort on the following day they plodded on until darkness overtook them with comparative safety fifteen miles away they made camp at last but there was no singing now and no joking in the bottom of his heart each prayed that they might come safely through just this night for they knew that during the morrow they would make the final stretch yet the nerves of each were taut with strained anticipation of what gruesome thing might flap down upon them from the black sky marking another for its own who would be the next as was their custom they took turns at guard each man doing two hours and then arousing the next brady had gone on from eight to ten followed by sinclair from ten to twelve then bradley had been awakened brady would stand the last guard from two to four as they had determined to start the moment that it became light enough to insure comparative safety upon the trail the snapping of a twig aroused brady out of a dead sleep and as he opened his eyes he saw that it was broad daylight and that at twenty paces from him stood a huge lion as the man sprang to his feet his rifle ready in his hand sinclair awoke and took in the scene in a single swift glance the fire was out and bradley was nowhere in sight for a long moment the lion and the men eyed one another the latter had no mind to fire if the beast minded its own affairs they were only too glad to let it go its way if it would but the lion was of a different mind suddenly the long tail snapped stiffly erect and as though it had been attached to two trigger fingers the two rifles spoke in unison for both men knew this signal only too well the immediate forerunner of a deadly charge as the brute's head had been raised his spine had not been visible and so they did what they had learned by long experience was best to do each covered a front leg and as the tail snapped aloft fired with a hideous roar the mighty flesh eater lurched forward to the ground with both front legs broken it was an easy accomplishment in the instant before the beast charged after it would have been well nigh an impossible feat brady stepped close in and finished him with a shot in the base of the brain lest his terrific roarings should attract his mate or others of their kind then the two men turned and looked at one another where is lieutenant bradley asked sinclair they walked to the fire only a few smoking embers remained a few feet away lay bradley's rifle there was no evidence of a struggle the two men circled about the camp twice and on the last lap brady stooped and picked up an object which had lain about ten yards beyond the fire it was bradley's cap again the two looked questioningly at one another and then simultaneously both pairs of eyes swung upward and searched the sky a moment later brady was examining the ground about the spot where bradley's cap had lain it was one of those little barren sandy stretches that they had found only upon this stony plateau brady's own footsteps showed as plainly as black ink upon white paper but his was the only foot that had marred the smooth windswept surface there was no sign that bradley had crossed the spot upon the surface of the ground and yet his cap lay well toward the center of it breakfastless and with shaken nerves the two survivors plunged madly into the long day's march both were strong courageous resourceful men but each had reached the limit of human nerve endurance and each felt that he would rather die than spend another night in the hideous open of that frightful land vivid in the mind of each was a picture of bradley's end for though neither had witnessed the tragedy both could imagine almost precisely what had occurred they did not discuss it they did not even mention it yet all day long the thing was uppermost in the mind of each and mingled with it a similar picture with himself as victim should they fail to make fort dinosaur before dark and so they plunged forward at reckless speed their clothes their hands their faces torn by the retarding underbrush that reached forth to hinder them again and again they fell but be it to their credit that the one always waited and helped the other and that into the mind of neither entered the thought or the temptation to desert his companion they would reach the fort together if both survived or neither would reach it they encountered the usual number of savage beasts and reptiles but they met them with a courageous recklessness born of desperation and by virtue of the very madness of the chances they took they came through unscathed and with the minimum of delay shortly after noon they reached the end of the plateau before them was a drop of two hundred feet to the valley beneath to the left in the distance they could see the waters of the great inland sea that covers a considerable portion of the area of the crater island of caprona and at a little lesser distance to the south of the cliffs they saw a thin spiral of smoke arising above the tree tops the landscape was familiar each recognized it immediately and knew that that smoky column marked the spot where dinosaur had stood was the fort still there or did the smoke arise from the smoldering embers of the building they had helped to fashion for the housing of their party who could say thirty precious minutes that seemed as many hours to the impatient men were consumed in locating a precarious way from the summit to the base of the cliffs that bounded the plateau upon the south and then once again they struck off upon level ground toward their goal the closer they approached the fort the greater became their apprehension that all would not be well they pictured the barracks deserted or the small company massacred and the buildings in ashes it was almost in a frenzy of fear that they broke through the final fringe of jungle and stood at last upon the verge of the open meadow a half mile from fort dinosaur lord ejaculated sinclair they are still there and he fell to his knees sobbing brady trembled like a leaf as he crossed himself and gave silent thanks for there before them stood the sturdy ramparts of dinosaur and from inside the inclosure rose a thin spiral of smoke that marked the location of the cook house all was well then and their comrades were preparing the evening meal across the clearing they raced as though they had not already covered in a single day a trackless primeval country that might easily have required two days by fresh and untired men within hailing distance they set up such a loud shouting that presently heads appeared above the top of the parapet and soon answering shouts were rising from within fort dinosaur a moment later three men issued from the inclosure and came forward to meet the survivors and listen to the hurried story of the eleven eventful days since they had set out upon their expedition to the barrier cliffs they heard of the deaths of tippet and james and of the disappearance of lieutenant bradley and a new terror settled upon dinosaur olson the irish engineer with whitely and wilson constituted the remnants of dinosaur's defenders and to brady and sinclair they narrated the salient events that had transpired since bradley and his party had marched away on september 4th they told them of the infamous act of baron friedrich von schoenvorts and his german crew who had stolen the u 33 breaking their parole and steaming away toward the subterranean opening through the barrier cliffs that carried the waters of the inland sea into the open pacific beyond and of the cowardly shelling of the fort they told of the disappearance of miss la rue in the night of september 11th and of the departure of bowen tyler in search of her accompanied only by his airedale nobs thus of the original party of eleven allies and nine germans that had constituted the company of the u 33 when she left english waters after her capture by the crew of the english tug there were but five now to be accounted for at fort dinosaur benson tippet james and one of the germans were known to be dead it was assumed that bradley tyler and the girl had already succumbed to some of the savage denizens of caspak while the fate of the germans was equally unknown though it might readily be believed that they had made good their escape they had had ample time to provision the ship and the refining of the crude oil they had discovered north of the fort could have insured them an ample supply to carry them back to germany chapter 2 when bradley went on guard at midnight september 14th his thoughts were largely occupied with rejoicing that the night was almost spent without serious mishap and that the morrow would doubtless see them all safely returned to fort dinosaur the hopefulness of his mood was tinged with sorrow by recollection of the two members of his party who lay back there in the savage wilderness and for whom there would never again be a homecoming no premonition of impending ill cast gloom over his anticipations for the coming day for bradley was a man who while taking every precaution against possible danger permitted no gloomy forebodings to weigh down his spirit when danger threatened he was prepared but he was not forever courting disaster and so it was that when about one o'clock in the morning of the fifteenth he heard the dismal flapping of giant wings overhead he was neither surprised nor frightened but idly prepared for an attack he had known might reasonably be expected the sound seemed to come from the south and presently low above the trees in that direction the man made out a dim shadowy form circling slowly about bradley was a brave man yet so keen was the feeling of revulsion engendered by the sight and sound of that grim uncanny shape that he distinctly felt the gooseflesh rise over the surface of his body and it was with difficulty that he refrained from following an instinctive urge to fire upon the nocturnal intruder better far better would it have been had he given in to the insistent demand of his subconscious mentor but his almost fanatical obsession to save ammunition proved now his undoing for while his attention was riveted upon the thing circling before him and while his ears were filled with the beating of its wings there swooped silently out of the black night behind him another weird and ghostly shape with its huge wings partly closed for the dive and its white robe fluttering in its wake the apparition swooped down upon the englishman so great was the force of the impact when the thing struck bradley between the shoulders that the man was half stunned his rifle flew from his grasp he felt clawlike talons of great strength seize him beneath his arms and sweep him off his feet and then the thing rose swiftly with him so swiftly that his cap was blown from his head by the rush of air as he was borne rapidly upward into the inky sky and the cry of warning to his companions was forced back into his lungs the creature wheeled immediately toward the east and was at once joined by its fellow who circled them once and then fell in behind them bradley now realized the strategy that the pair had used to capture him and at once concluded that he was in the power of reasoning beings closely related to the human race if not actually of it past experience suggested that the great wings were a part of some ingenious mechanical device for the limitations of the human mind which is always loath to accept aught beyond its own little experience would not permit him to entertain the idea that the creatures might be naturally winged and at the same time of human origin from his position bradley could not see the wings of his captor nor in the darkness had he been able to examine those of the second creature closely when it circled before him he listened for the puff of a motor or some other telltale sound that would prove the correctness of his theory however he was rewarded with nothing more than the constant flap flap presently far below and ahead he saw the waters of the inland sea and a moment later he was borne over them then his captor did that which proved beyond doubt to bradley that he was in the hands of human beings who had devised an almost perfect scheme of duplicating mechanically the wings of a bird the thing spoke to its companion and in a language that bradley partially understood since he recognized words that he had learned from the savage races of caspak from this he judged that they were human and being human he knew that they could have no natural wings for who had ever seen a human being so adorned therefore their wings must be mechanical thus bradley reasoned thus most of us reason not by what might be possible but by what has fallen within the range of our experience what he heard them say was to the effect that having covered half the distance the burden would now be transferred from one to the other bradley wondered how the exchange was to be accomplished he knew that those giant wings would not permit the creatures to approach one another closely enough to effect the transfer in this manner but he was soon to discover that they had other means of doing it he felt the thing that carried him rise to a greater altitude and below he glimpsed momentarily the second white robed figure then the creature above sounded a low call it was answered from below and instantly bradley felt the clutching talons release him gasping for breath he hurtled downward through space for a terrifying instant pregnant with horror bradley fell then something swooped for him from behind another pair of talons clutched him beneath the arms his downward rush was checked within another hundred feet and close to the surface of the sea he was again borne upward as a hawk dives for a songbird on the wing so this great human bird dived for bradley it was a harrowing experience but soon over and once again the captive was being carried swiftly toward the east and what fate he could not even guess it was immediately following his transfer in mid air that bradley made out the shadowy form of a large island far ahead and not long after he realized that this must be the intended destination of his captors nor was he mistaken three quarters of an hour from the time of his seizure his captors dropped gently to earth in the strangest city that human eye had ever rested upon just a brief glimpse of his immediate surroundings vouchsafed bradley before he was whisked into the interior of one of the buildings but in that momentary glance he saw strange piles of stone and wood and mud fashioned into buildings of all conceivable sizes and shapes sometimes piled high on top of one another sometimes standing alone in an open court way but usually crowded and jammed together so that there were no streets or alleys between them other than a few which ended almost as soon as they began the principal doorways appeared to be in the roofs and it was through one of these that bradley was inducted into the dark interior of a low ceiled room here he was pushed roughly into a corner where he tripped over a thick mat and there his captors left him he heard them moving about in the darkness for a moment and several times he saw their large luminous eyes glowing in the dark finally these disappeared and silence reigned broken only by the breathing of the creature which indicated to the englishman that they were sleeping somewhere in the same apartment it was now evident that the mat upon the floor was intended for sleeping purposes and that the rough shove that had sent him to it had been a rude invitation to repose after taking stock of himself and finding that he still had his pistol and ammunition some matches a little tobacco a canteen full of water and a razor bradley made himself comfortable upon the mat and was soon asleep knowing that an attempted escape in the darkness without knowledge of his surroundings would be predoomed to failure when he awoke it was broad daylight and the sight that met his eyes made him rub them again and again to assure himself that they were really open and that he was not dreaming a broad shaft of morning light poured through the open doorway in the ceiling of the room which was about thirty feet square or roughly square being irregular in shape one side curving outward another being indented by what might have been the corner of another building jutting into it another alcoved by three sides of an octagon while the fourth was serpentine in contour two windows let in more daylight while two doors evidently gave ingress to other rooms the walls were partially ceiled with thin strips of wood nicely fitted and finished partially plastered and the rest covered with a fine woven cloth figures of reptiles and beasts were painted without regard to any uniform scheme here and there upon the walls a striking feature of the decorations consisted of several engaged columns set into the walls at no regular intervals the capitals of each supporting a human skull the cranium of which touched the ceiling as though the latter was supported by these grim reminders either of departed relatives or of some hideous tribal rite bradley could not but wonder which yet it was none of these things that filled him with greatest wonder no it was the figures of the two creatures that had captured him and brought him hither at one end of the room a stout pole about two inches in diameter ran horizontally from wall to wall some six or seven feet from the floor its ends securely set in two of the columns hanging by their knees from this perch their heads downward and their bodies wrapped in their huge wings slept the creatures of the night before like two great horrid bats they hung asleep as bradley gazed upon them in wide eyed astonishment he saw plainly that all his intelligence all his acquired knowledge through years of observation and experience were set at naught by the simple evidence of the fact that stood out glaringly before his eyes the creatures wings were not mechanical devices but as natural appendages growing from their shoulderblades as were their arms and legs he saw too that except for their wings the pair bore a strong resemblance to human beings though fashioned in a most grotesque mold as he sat gazing at them one of the two awoke separated his wings to release his arms that had been folded across his breast placed his hands upon the floor dropped his feet and stood erect for a moment he stretched his great wings slowly solemnly blinking his large round eyes then his gaze fell upon bradley the thin lips drew back tightly against yellow teeth in a grimace that was nothing but hideous it could not have been termed a smile and what emotion it registered the englishman was at a loss to guess no expression whatever altered the steady gaze of those large round eyes there was no color upon the pasty sunken cheeks a death's head grimaced as though a man long dead raised his parchment covered skull from an old grave the creature stood about the height of an average man but appeared much taller from the fact that the joints of his long wings rose fully a foot above his hairless head the bare arms were long and sinewy ending in strong bony hands with clawlike fingers almost talonlike in their suggestiveness the white robe was separated in front revealing skinny legs and the further fact that the thing wore but the single garment which was of fine woven cloth from crown to sole the portions of the body exposed were entirely hairless and as he noted this bradley also noted for the first time the cause of much of the seeming expressionlessness of the creature's countenance it had neither eye brows or lashes the ears were small and rested flat against the skull which was noticeably round though the face was quite flat the creature had small feet beautifully arched and plump but so out of keeping with every other physical attribute it possessed as to appear ridiculous after eyeing bradley for a moment the thing approached him where from it asked england replied bradley as briefly where is england and what pursued the questioner it is a country far from here answered the englishman are your people cor sva jo or cos ata lu i do not understand you said bradley and now suppose you answer a few questions who are you what country is this why did you bring me here again the sepulchral grimace we are wieroos luata is our father caspak is ours this our country is called oo oh we brought you here for literally him who speaks for luata to gaze upon and question he would know from whence you came and why but principally if you be cos ata lu and if i am not cos whatever you call the bloomin beast what of it the wieroo raised his wings in a very human shrug and waved his bony claws toward the human skulls supporting the ceiling his gesture was eloquent but he embellished it by remarking and possibly if you are i'm hungry snapped bradley the wieroo motioned him to one of the doors which he threw open permitting bradley to pass out onto another roof on a level lower than that upon which they had landed earlier in the morning by daylight the city appeared even more remarkable than in the moonlight though less weird and unreal the houses of all shapes and sizes were piled about as a child might pile blocks of various forms and colors he saw now that there were what might be called streets or alleys but they ran in baffling turns and twists nor ever reached a destination always ending in a dead wall where some wieroo had built a house across them upon each house was a slender column supporting a human skull sometimes the columns were at one corner of the roof sometimes at another or again they rose from the center or near the center and the columns were of varying heights from that of a man to those which rose twenty feet above"
