she gone and he might never see her again he would be just as lonely there as here nay it would be much worse if he had to think that the window was nothing but a hole in the wall at the very moment when he burst out crying the old nurse who had grown to be one of the family for she had not gone away when miss coleman did not want any more nursing came to the back door which was of glass to close the shutters she thought she heard a cry and peering out with a hand on each side of her eyes like diamond's blinkers she saw something white on the lawn too old and too wise to be frightened she opened the door and went straight towards the white thing to see what it was and when diamond saw her coming he was not frightened either though mrs crump was a little cross sometimes for there is a good kind of crossness that is only disagreeable and there is a bad kind of crossness that is very nasty indeed so she came up with her neck stretched out and her head at the end of it and her eyes foremost of all like a snail's peering into the night to see what it could be that went on glimmering white before her when she did see she made a great exclamation and threw up her hands then without a word for she thought diamond was walking in his sleep she caught hold of him and led him towards the house he made no objection for he was just in the mood to be grateful for notice of any sort and mrs crump led him straight into the drawing room now from the neglect of the new housemaid the fire in miss coleman's bedroom had gone out and her mother had told her to brush her hair by the drawing room fire a disorderly proceeding which a mother's wish could justify the young lady was very lovely though not nearly so beautiful as north wind and her hair was extremely long for it came down to her knees though that was nothing at all to north wind's hair yet when she looked round with her hair all about her as diamond entered he thought for one moment that it was north wind and pulling his hand from mrs crump's he stretched out his arms and ran towards miss coleman she was so pleased that she threw down her brush and almost knelt on the floor to receive him in her arms he saw the next moment that she was not lady north wind but she looked so like her he could not help running into her arms and bursting into tears afresh mrs crump said the poor child had walked out in his sleep and diamond thought she ought to know and did not contradict her for anything he knew it might be so indeed he let them talk on about him and said nothing and when after their astonishment was over and miss coleman had given him a sponge cake it was decreed that mrs crump should take him to his mother he was quite satisfied his mother had to get out of bed to open the door when mrs crump knocked she was indeed surprised to see her boy and having taken him in her arms and carried him to his bed returned and had a long confabulation with mrs crump for they were still talking when diamond fell fast asleep and could hear them no longer chapter iii old diamond diamond woke very early in the morning and thought what a curious dream he had had but the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head until it did not look altogether like a dream and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night he came to the conclusion that if he had really been brought home to his mother by mrs crump she would say something to him about it and that would settle the matter then he got up and dressed himself but finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring he went down the ladder to the stable there he found that even old diamond was not awake yet for he as well as young diamond always got up the moment he woke and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw i'll give old diamond a surprise thought the boy and creeping up very softly before the horse knew he was astride of his back then it was young diamond's turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected for as with an earthquake with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs young diamond found himself hoisted up in the air with both hands twisted in the horse's mane the next instant old diamond lashed out with both his hind legs and giving one cry of terror young diamond found himself lying on his neck with his arms as far round it as they would go but then the horse stood as still as a stone except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back for when he heard young diamond's cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about for young diamond was a good boy and old diamond was a good horse and the one was all right on the back of the other as soon as diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place the horse began pulling at the hay and the boy began thinking he had never mounted diamond himself before and he had never got off him without being lifted down so he sat while the horse ate wondering how he was to reach the ground but while he meditated his mother woke and her first thought was to see her boy she had visited him twice during the night and found him sleeping quietly now his bed was empty and she was frightened diamond diamond where are you diamond she called out diamond turned his head where he sat like a knight on his steed in enchanted stall and cried aloud here mother where diamond she returned here mother on diamond's back she came running to the ladder and peeping down saw him aloft on the great horse come down diamond she said i can't answered diamond how did you get up asked his mother quite easily answered he but when i got up diamond would get up too and so here i am his mother thought he had been walking in his sleep again and hurried down the ladder she did not much like going up to the horse for she had not been used to horses but she would have gone into a lion's den not to say a horse's stall to help her boy so she went and lifted him off diamond's back and felt braver all her life after she carried him in her arms up to her room but afraid of frightening him at his own sleep walking as she supposed it said nothing about last night before the next day was over diamond had almost concluded the whole adventure a dream for a week his mother watched him very carefully going into the loft several times a night as often in fact as she woke every time she found him fast asleep all that week it was hard weather the grass showed white in the morning with the hoar frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade and as diamond's shoes were not good and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him she would not let him run out he played all his games over and over indoors especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby's cradle and if they did not go very fast they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world although one of them had only three legs and the other only half a back at length his mother brought home his new shoes and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour the sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage all the world was new to him a great fire of sunset burned on the top of the gate that led from the stables to the house above the fire in the sky lay a large lake of green light above that a golden cloud and over that the blue of the wintry heavens and diamond thought that next to his own home he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky for it is not fine things that make home a nice place but your mother and your father as he was looking at the lovely colours the gates were thrown open and there was old diamond and his friend in the carriage dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats and in they came diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him but careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape with a red edge to every fold he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables to be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery as he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream and once more he was almost sure that it was no dream at all events he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then he opened the door and passed through the little belt of shrubbery not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn even the brave old chrysanthemums and christmas roses had passed away before the frost what yes there was one he ran and knelt down to look at it it was a primrose a dwarfish thing but perfect in shape a baby wonder as he stooped his face to see it close a little wind began to blow and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered but the primrose lay still in the green hollow looking up at the sky and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all it was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with all at once diamond thought it was saying its prayers and he ought not to be staring at it so he ran to the stable to see his father make diamond's bed then his father took him in his arms carried him up the ladder and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea miss is very poorly said diamond's father mis'ess has been to the doctor with her to day and she looked very glum when she came out again i was a watching of them to see what doctor had said and didn't miss look glum too asked his mother not half as glum as mis'ess returned the coachman you see but he lowered his voice and diamond could not make out more than a word here and there for diamond's father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at and one of the best of drivers but one of the most discreet of servants as well therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife whom he had proved better than himself long ago and was careful that even diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family it was bed time soon and diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep he awoke all at once in the dark open the window diamond said a voice now diamond's mother had once more pasted up north wind's window are you north wind said diamond i don't hear you blowing no but you hear me talking open the window for i haven't overmuch time yes returned diamond but please north wind where's the use you left me all alone last time he had got up on his knees and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall for now that north wind spoke again he remembered all that had taken place before as distinctly as if it had happened only last night yes but that was your fault returned north wind i had work to do and besides a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting but i'm not a gentleman said diamond scratching away at the paper i hope you won't say so ten years after this i'm going to be a coachman and a coachman is not a gentleman persisted diamond we call your father a gentleman in our house said north wind he doesn't call himself one said diamond that's of no consequence every man ought to be a gentleman and your father is one diamond was so pleased to hear this that he scratched at the paper like ten mice and getting hold of the edge of it tore it off the next instant a young girl glided across the bed and stood upon the floor oh dear said diamond quite dismayed i didn't know who are you please i'm north wind are you really yes make haste but you're no bigger than me do you think i care about how big or how little i am didn't you see me this evening i was less then no where was you behind the leaves of the primrose didn't you see them blowing yes make haste then if you want to go with me but you are not big enough to take care of me i think you are only miss north wind i am big enough to show you the way anyhow but if you won't come why you must stay i must dress myself i didn't mind with a grown lady but i couldn't go with a little girl in my night gown very well i'm not in such a hurry as i was the other night dress as fast as you can and i'll go and shake the primrose leaves till you come don't hurt it said diamond north wind broke out in a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles and was gone in a moment diamond saw for it was a starlit night and the mass of hay was at a low ebb now the gleam of something vanishing down the stair and springing out of bed dressed himself as fast as ever he could then he crept out into the yard through the door in the wall and away to the primrose behind it stood north wind leaning over it and looking at the flower as if she had been its mother come along she said jumping up and holding out her hand diamond took her hand it was cold but so pleasant and full of life it was better than warm she led him across the garden with one bound she was on the top of the wall diamond was left at the foot stop stop he cried please i can't jump like that you don't try said north wind who from the top looked down a foot taller than before give me your hand again and i will try said diamond she reached down diamond laid hold of her hand gave a great spring and stood beside her this is nice he said another bound and they stood in the road by the river it was full tide and the stars were shining clear in its depths for it lay still waiting for the turn to run down again to the sea they walked along its side but they had not walked far before its surface was covered with ripples and the stars had vanished from its bosom and north wind was now tall as a full grown girl her hair was flying about her head and the wind was blowing a breeze down the river but she turned aside and went up a narrow lane and as she went her hair fell down around her i have some rather disagreeable work to do to night she said before i get out to sea and i must set about it at once the disagreeable work must be looked after first so saying she laid hold of diamond and began to run gliding along faster and faster diamond kept up with her as well as he could she made many turnings and windings apparently because it was not quite easy to get him over walls and houses once they ran through a hall where they found back and front doors open at the foot of the stair north wind stood still and diamond hearing a great growl started in terror and there instead of north wind was a huge wolf by his side he let go his hold in dismay and the wolf bounded up the stair the windows of the house rattled and shook as if guns were firing and the sound of a great fall came from above diamond stood with white face staring up at the landing surely he thought north wind can't be eating one of the children coming to himself all at once he rushed after her with his little fist clenched there were ladies in long trains going up and down the stairs and gentlemen in white neckties attending on them who stared at him but none of them were of the people of the house and they said nothing before he reached the head of the stair however north wind met him took him by the hand and hurried down and out of the house i hope you haven't eaten a baby north wind said diamond very solemnly north wind laughed merrily and went tripping on faster her grassy robe swept and swirled about her steps and wherever it passed over withered leaves they went fleeing and whirling in spirals and running on their edges like wheels all about her feet no she said at last i did not eat a baby you would not have had to ask that foolish question if you had not let go your hold of me you would have seen how i served a nurse that was calling a child bad names and telling her she was wicked she had been drinking i saw an ugly gin bottle in a cupboard and you frightened her said diamond i believe so answered north wind laughing merrily i flew at her throat and she tumbled over on the floor with such a crash that they ran in she'll be turned away to morrow and quite time if they knew as much as i do but didn't you frighten the little one she never saw me the woman would not have seen me either if she had not been wicked oh said diamond dubiously why should you see things returned north wind that you wouldn't understand or know what to do with good people see good things bad people bad things then are you a bad thing no for you see me diamond dear said the girl and she looked down at him and diamond saw the loving eyes of the great lady beaming from the depths of her falling hair i had to make myself look like a bad thing before she could see me if i had put on any other shape than a wolf's she would not have seen me for that is what is growing to be her own shape inside of her i don't know what you mean said diamond but i suppose it's all right they were now climbing the slope of a grassy ascent it was primrose hill in fact although diamond had never heard of it the moment they reached the top north wind stood and turned her face towards london the stars were still shining clear and cold overhead there was not a cloud to be seen the air was sharp but diamond did not find it cold now said the lady whatever you do do not let my hand go i might have lost you the last time only i was not in a hurry then now i am in a hurry yet she stood still for a moment chapter iv north wind and as she stood looking towards london diamond saw that she was trembling are you cold north wind he asked no diamond she answered looking down upon him with a smile i am only getting ready to sweep one of my rooms those careless greedy untidy children make it in such a mess as she spoke he could have told by her voice if he had not seen with his eyes that she was growing larger and larger her head went up and up towards the stars and as she grew still trembling through all her body her hair also grew longer and longer and lifted itself from her head and went out in black waves the next moment however it fell back around her and she grew less and less till she was only a tall woman then she put her hands behind her head and gathered some of her hair and began weaving and knotting it together when she had done she bent down her beautiful face close to his and said diamond i am afraid you would not keep hold of me and if i were to drop you i don't know what might happen so i have been making a place for you in my hair come diamond held out his arms for with that grand face looking at him he believed like a baby she took him in her hands threw him over her shoulder and said get in diamond and diamond parted her hair with his hands crept between and feeling about soon found the woven nest it was just like a pocket or like the shawl in which gipsy women carry their children north wind put her hands to her back felt all about the nest and finding it safe said are you comfortable diamond yes indeed answered diamond the next moment he was rising in the air north wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds her hair went streaming out from her till it spread like a mist over the stars she flung herself abroad in space diamond held on by two of the twisted ropes which parted and interwoven formed his shelter for he could not help being a little afraid as soon as he had come to himself he peeped through the woven meshes for he did not dare to look over the top of the nest the earth was rushing past like a river or a sea below him trees and water and green grass hurried away beneath a great roar of wild animals rose as they rushed over the zoological gardens mixed with a chattering of monkeys and a screaming of birds but it died away in a moment behind them and now there was nothing but the roofs of houses sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks chimney pots fell and tiles flew from the roofs but it looked to him as if they were left behind by the roofs and the chimneys as they scudded away there was a great roaring for the wind was dashing against london like a sea but at north wind's back diamond of course felt nothing of it all he was in a perfect calm he could hear the sound of it that was all by and by he raised himself and looked over the edge of his nest there were the houses rushing up and shooting away below him like a fierce torrent of rocks instead of water then he looked up to the sky but could see no stars they were hidden by the blinding masses of the lady's hair which swept between he began to wonder whether she would hear him if he spoke he would try please north wind he said what is that noise from high over his head came the voice of north wind answering him gently the noise of my besom i am the old woman that sweeps the cobwebs from the sky only i'm busy with the floor now what makes the houses look as if they were running away i am sweeping so fast over them but please north wind i knew london was very big but i didn't know it was so big as this it seems as if we should never get away from it we are going round and round else we should have left it long ago is this the way you sweep north wind yes i go round and round with my great besom please would you mind going a little slower for i want to see the streets you won't see much now why because i have nearly swept all the people home oh i forgot said diamond and was quiet after that for he did not want to be troublesome but she dropped a little towards the roofs of the houses and diamond could see down into the streets there were very few people about though the lamps flickered and flared again but nobody seemed to want them suddenly diamond espied a little girl coming along a street she was dreadfully blown by the wind and a broom she was trailing behind her was very troublesome it seemed as if the wind had a spite at her it kept worrying her like a wild beast and tearing at her rags she was so lonely there oh please north wind he cried won't you help that little girl no diamond i mustn't leave my work but why shouldn't you be kind to her i am kind to her i am sweeping the wicked smells away but you're kinder to me dear north wind why shouldn't you be as kind to her as you are to me there are reasons diamond everybody can't be done to all the same everybody is not ready for the same thing but i don't see why i should be kinder used than she do you think nothing's to be done but what you can see diamond you silly it's all right of course you can help her if you like you've got nothing particular to do at this moment i have oh do let me help her then but you won't be able to wait perhaps no i can't wait you must do it yourself and mind the wind will get a hold of you too don't you want me to help her north wind not without having some idea what will happen if you break down and cry that won't be much of a help to her and it will make a goose of little diamond i want to go said diamond only there's just one thing how am i to get home if you're anxious about that perhaps you had better go with me i am bound to take you home again if you do there cried diamond who was still looking after the little girl i'm sure the wind will blow her over and perhaps kill her do let me go they had been sweeping more slowly along the line of the street there was a lull in the roaring well though i cannot promise to take you home said north wind as she sank nearer and nearer to the tops of the houses i can promise you it will be all right in the end you will get home somehow have you made up your mind what to do yes to help the little girl said diamond firmly the same moment north wind dropt into the street and stood only a tall lady but with her hair flying up over the housetops she put her hands to her back took diamond and set him down in the street the same moment he was caught in the fierce coils of the blast and all but blown away north wind stepped back a step and at once towered in stature to the height of the houses a chimney pot clashed at diamond's feet he turned in terror but it was to look for the little girl and when he turned again the lady had vanished and the wind was roaring along the street as if it had been the bed of an invisible torrent the little girl was scudding before the blast her hair flying too and behind her she dragged her broom her little legs were going as fast as ever they could to keep her from falling diamond crept into the shelter of a doorway thinking"
