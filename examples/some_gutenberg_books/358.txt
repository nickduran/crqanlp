"1" "forward ahead of it across the little reed grown inlet stretched their road of escape a long wooden bridge lying white in the moonlight i don't see a soul whispered miss forbes anybody at that draw asked winthrop unconsciously his voice also had sunk to a whisper no returned fred i think the man that tends the draw goes home at night there is no light there well then said winthrop with an anxious sigh we've got to make a dash for it the car shot forward and as it leaped lightly upon the bridge there was a rapid rumble of creaking boards between it and the highway to new york lay only two hundred yards of track straight and empty in his excitement the chauffeur rose from the rear seat they'll never catch us now he muttered they'll never catch us but even as he spoke there grated harshly the creak of rusty chains on a cogged wheel the rattle of a brake the black figure of a man with waving arms ran out upon the draw and the draw gaped slowly open when the car halted there was between it and the broken edge of the bridge twenty feet of running water at the same moment from behind it came a patter of feet and winthrop turned to see racing toward them some dozen young men of fairport they surrounded him with noisy raucous belligerent cries they were as they proudly informed him members of the fairport volunteer fire department that they might purchase new uniforms they had arranged a trap for the automobiles returning in illegal haste from new haven in fines they had collected 300 and it was evident that already some of that money had been expended in bad whiskey as many as could do so crowded into the car others hung to the running boards and step others ran beside it they rejoiced over winthrop's unsuccessful flight and capture with violent and humiliating laughter for the day judge allen had made a temporary court in the clubroom of the fire department which was over the engine house and the proceedings were brief and decisive the selectman told how winthrop after first breaking the speed law had broken arrest and judge allen refusing to fine him and let him go held him and his companions for a hearing the following morning he fixed the amount of bail at 500 each failing to pay this they would for the night be locked up in different parts of the engine house which it developed contained on the ground floor the home of the fire engine on the second floor the clubroom on alternate nights of the firemen the local g a r and the knights of pythias and in its cellar the town jail winthrop and the chauffeur the learned judge condemned to the cells in the basement as a concession he granted miss forbes the freedom of the entire clubroom to herself the objections raised by winthrop to this arrangement were of a nature so violent so vigorous at one moment so specious and conciliatory and the next so abusive that his listeners were moved by awe but not to pity in his indignation judge allen rose to reply and as the better to hear him the crowd pushed forward fred gave way before it until he was left standing in sullen gloom upon its outer edge in imitation of the real firemen of the great cities the vamps of fairport had cut a circular hole in the floor of their clubroom and from the engine room below had reared a sliding pole of shining brass when leaving their clubroom it was always their pleasure to scorn the stairs and like real firemen slide down this pole it had not escaped the notice of fred and since his entrance he had been gravitating toward it as the voice of the judge rose in violent objurgation and all eyes were fixed upon him the chauffeur crooked his leg tightly about the brass pole and like the devil in the pantomime sank softly and swiftly through the floor the irate judge was shaking his finger in winthrop's face don't you try to teach me no law he shouted i know what i can do ef my darter went gallivantin around nights in one of them automobiles it would serve her right to get locked up maybe this young woman will learn to stay at home nights with her folks she ain't goin to take no harm here the constable sits up all night downstairs in the fire engine room and that sofa's as good a place to sleep as the hotel if you want me to let her go to the hotel why don't you send to your folks and bail her out you know damn well why i don't returned winthrop i don't intend to give the newspapers and you and these other idiots the chance to annoy her further this young lady's brother has been with us all day he left us only by accident and by forcing her to remain here alone you are acting outrageously if you knew anything of decency or law you'd i know this much roared the justice triumphantly pointing his spectacle case at miss forbes i know her name ain't lizzie borden and yours ain't charley ross winthrop crossed to where miss forbes stood in a corner she still wore her veil but through it though her face was pale she smiled at him his own distress was undisguised i can never forgive myself he said nonsense replied miss forbes briskly you were perfectly right if we had sent for any one it would have had to come out now we'll pay the fine in the morning and get home and no one will know anything of it excepting the family and mr peabody and they'll understand but if i ever lay hands on my brother sam she clasped her fingers together helplessly to think of his leaving you to spend the night in a cell winthrop interrupted her i will get one of these men to send his wife or sister over to stay with you he said but miss forbes protested that she did not want a companion the constable would protect her she said and she would sit up all night and read she nodded at the periodicals on the club table this is the only chance i may ever have she said to read the police gazette you ready there called the constable good night said winthrop under the eyes of the grinning yokels they shook hands good night said the girl where's your young man demanded the chief of police my what inquired winthrop the young fellow that was with you when we held you up that first time the constable or the chief of police as he called himself on the principle that if there were only one policeman he must necessarily be the chief glanced hastily over the heads of the crowd any of you holding that shoffer he called no one was holding the chauffeur the chauffeur had vanished the cell to which the constable led winthrop was in a corner of the cellar in which formerly coal had been stored this corner was now fenced off with boards and a wooden door with chain and padlock high in the wall on a level with the ground was the opening or window through which the coal had been dumped this window now was barricaded with iron bars winthrop tested the door by shaking it and landed a heavy kick on one of the hinges it gave slightly and emitted a feeble groan what you tryin to do demanded the constable that's town property in the light of the constable's lantern winthrop surveyed his cell with extreme dissatisfaction i call this a cheap cell he said it's good enough for a cheap sport returned the constable it was so overwhelming a retort that after the constable had turned the key in the padlock and taken himself and his lantern to the floor above winthrop could hear him repeating it to the volunteer firemen they received it with delighted howls for an hour on the three empty boxes that formed his bed winthrop sat with his chin on his fists planning the nameless atrocities he would inflict upon the village of fairport compared to his tortures those of neuremberg were merely reprimands also he considered the particular punishment he would mete out to sam forbes for his desertion of his sister and to fred he could not understand fred it was not like the chauffeur to think only of himself nevertheless for abandoning miss forbes in the hour of need fred must be discharged he had with some regret determined upon this discipline when from directly over his head the voice of fred hailed him cautiously mr winthrop the voice called are you there to winthrop the question seemed superfluous he jumped to his feet and peered up into the darkness where are you he demanded at the window came the answer we're in the back yard mr sam wants to speak to you on miss forbes's account winthrop gave a gasp of relief on his own one of savage satisfaction and _i_ want to speak to him he whispered the moonlight which had been faintly shining through the iron bars of the coal chute was eclipsed by a head and shoulders the comfortable voice of sam forbes greeted him in a playful whisper hullo billy you down there where the devil did you think i was winthrop answered at white heat let me tell you if i was not down here i'd be punching your head that's all right billy sam answered soothingly but i'll save you just the same it shall never be said of sam forbes he deserted a comrade stop that do you know winthrop demanded fiercely that your sister is a prisoner upstairs i do replied the unfeeling brother but she won't be long all the low comedy parts are out now arranging a rescue who are todd and those boys demanded winthrop they mustn't think of it they'll only make it worse it is impossible to get your sister out of here with those drunken firemen in the building you must wait till they've gone home do you hear me pardon me returned sam stiffly but this is my relief expedition i have sent two of the boys to hold the bridge like horatius and two to guard the motors and the others are going to entice the firemen away from the engine house entice them how demanded winthrop they're drunk and they won't leave here till morning outside the engine house suspended from a heavy cross bar was a steel rail borrowed from a railroad track and bent into a hoop when hit with a sledge hammer it proclaimed to fairport that the consuming element was at large at the moment winthrop asked his question over the village of fairport and over the bay and marshes and far out across the sound the great steel bar sent forth a shuddering boom of warning from the room above came a wild tumult of joyous yells fire shrieked the vamps fire the two men crouching by the cellar window heard the rush of feet the engine banging and bumping across the sidewalk its brass bell clanking crazily the happy vamps shouting hoarse incoherent orders through the window sam lowered a bag of tools he had taken from winthrop's car can you open the lock with any of these he asked i can kick it open yelled winthrop joyfully get to your sister quick he threw his shoulder against the door and the staples flying before him sent him sprawling in the coal dust when he reached the head of the stairs beatrice forbes was descending from the clubroom and in front of the door the two cars with their lamps unlit and numbers hidden were panting to be free and in the north reaching to the sky rose a roaring column of flame shameless in the pale moonlight dragging into naked day the sleeping village the shingled houses the clock face in the church steeple what the devil have you done gasped winthrop before he answered sam waited until the cars were rattling to safety across the bridge we have been protecting the face of nature he shouted the only way to get that gang out of the engine house was to set fire to something tommy wanted to burn up the railroad station because he doesn't like the new york and new haven and fred was for setting fire to judge allen's house because he was rude to beatrice but we finally formed the village improvement society organized to burn all advertising signs you know those that stood in the marshes and hid the view from the trains so that you could not see the sound we chopped them down and put them in a pile and poured gasolene on them and that fire is all that is left of the pickles fly screens and pills it was midnight when the cars drew up at the door of the house of forbes anxiously waiting in the library were mrs forbes and ernest peabody at last cried mrs forbes smiling her relief we thought maybe sam and you had decided to spend the night in new haven no said miss forbes there was some talk about spending the night at fairport but we pushed right on ii the trespassers with a long nervous shudder the scarlet car came to a stop and the lamps bored a round hole in the night leaving the rest of the encircling world in a chill and silent darkness the lamps showed a flickering picture of a country road between high banks covered with loose stones and overhead a fringe of pine boughs it looked like a colored photograph thrown from a stereopticon in a darkened theater from the back of the car the voice of the owner said briskly we will now sing that beautiful ballad entitled he is sleeping in the yukon vale to night what are you stopping for fred he asked the tone of the chauffeur suggested he was again upon the defensive for water sir he mumbled miss forbes in the front seat laughed and her brother in the rear seat groaned in dismay oh for water said the owner cordially i thought maybe it was for coal save a dignified silence there was no answer to this until there came a rolling of loose stones and the sound of a heavy body suddenly precipitated down the bank and landing with a thump in the road he didn't get the water said the owner sadly are you hurt fred asked the girl the chauffeur limped in front of the lamps appearing suddenly like an actor stepping into the limelight no ma'am he said in the rays of the lamp he unfolded a road map and scowled at it he shook his head aggrievedly there ought to be a house just about here he explained there ought to be a hotel and a garage and a cold supper just about here said the girl cheerfully that's the way with those houses complained the owner they never stay where they're put at night they go around and visit each other where do you think you are fred i think we're in that long woods between loon lake and stoughton on the boston pike said the chauffeur and he reiterated there ought to be a house somewhere about here where we get water well get there then and get the water commanded the owner but i can't get there sir till i get the water returned the chauffeur he shook out two collapsible buckets and started down the shaft of light i won't be more nor five minutes he called i'm going with him said the girl i'm cold she stepped down from the front seat and the owner with sudden alacrity vaulted the door and started after her you coming he inquired of ernest peabody but ernest peabody being soundly asleep made no reply winthrop turned to sam are you coming he repeated the tone of the invitation seemed to suggest that a refusal would not necessarily lead to a quarrel i am not said the brother you've kept peabody and me twelve hours in the open air and it's past two and we're going to sleep you can take it from me that we are going to spend the rest of this night here in this road he moved his cramped joints cautiously and stretched his legs the full width of the car if you can't get plain water he called get club soda he buried his nose in the collar of his fur coat and the odors of camphor and raccoon skins instantly assailed him but he only yawned luxuriously and disappeared into the coat as a turtle draws into its shell from the woods about him the smell of the pine needles pressed upon him like a drug and before the footsteps of his companions were lost in the silence he was asleep but his sleep was only a review of his waking hours still on either hand rose flying dust clouds and twirling leaves still on either side raced gray stone walls telegraph poles hills rich in autumn colors and before him a long white road unending interminable stretching out finally into a darkness lit by flashing shop windows like open fireplaces by street lamps by swinging electric globes by the blinding searchlights of hundreds of darting trolley cars with terrifying gongs and then a cold white mist and again on every side darkness except where the four great lamps blazed a path through stretches of ghostly woods as the two young men slumbered the lamps spluttered and sizzled like bacon in a frying pan a stone rolled noisily down the bank a white owl both appalled and fascinated by the dazzling eyes of the monster blocking the road hooted and flapped itself away but the men in the car only shivered slightly deep in the sleep of utter weariness in silence the girl and winthrop followed the chauffeur they had passed out of the light of the lamps and in the autumn mist the electric torch of the owner was as ineffective as a glow worm the mystery of the forest fell heavily upon them from their feet the dead leaves sent up a clean damp odor and on either side and overhead the giant pine trees whispered and rustled in the night wind take my coat too said the young man you'll catch cold he spoke with authority and began to slip the loops from the big horn buttons it was not the habit of the girl to consider her health nor did she permit the members of her family to show solicitude concerning it but the anxiety of the young man did not seem to offend her she thanked him generously no these coats are hard to walk in and i want to walk she exclaimed i like to hear the leaves rustle when you kick them don't you when i was so high i used to pretend it was wading in the surf the young man moved over to the gutter of the road where the leaves were deepest and kicked violently and the more noise you make he said the more you frighten away the wild animals the girl shuddered in a most helpless and fascinating fashion don't she whispered i didn't mention it but already i have seen several lions crouching behind the trees indeed said the young man his tone was preoccupied he had just kicked a rock hidden by the leaves and was standing on one leg do you mean you don't believe me asked the girl or is it that you are merely brave merely brave exclaimed the young man massachusetts is so far north for lions he continued that i fancy what you saw was a grizzly bear but i have my trusty electric torch with me and if there is anything a bear cannot abide it is to be pointed at by an electric torch let us pretend cried the girl that we are the babes in the wood and that we are lost we don't have to pretend we're lost said the man and as i remember it the babes came to a sad end didn't they die and didn't the birds bury them with leaves sam and mr peabody can be the birds suggested the girl sam and peabody hopping around with leaves in their teeth would look silly objected the man i doubt if i could keep from laughing then said the girl they can be the wicked robbers who came to kill the babes very well said the man with suspicious alacrity let us be babes if i have to die he went on heartily i would rather die with you than live with any one else when he had spoken although they were entirely alone in the world and quite near to each other it was as though the girl could not hear him even as though he had not spoken at all after a silence the girl said perhaps it would be better for us to go back to the car i won't do it again begged the man we will pretend cried the girl that the car is a van and that we are gypsies and we'll build a campfire and i will tell your fortune you are the only woman who can muttered the young man the girl still stood in her tracks you said she began i know interrupted the man but you won't let me talk seriously so i joke but some day oh look cried the girl there's fred she ran from him down the road the young man followed her slowly his fists deep in the pockets of the great coat and kicking at the unoffending leaves the chauffeur was peering through a double iron gate hung between square brick posts the lower hinge of one gate was broken and that gate lurched forward leaving an opening by the light of the electric torch they could see the beginning of a driveway rough and weed grown lined with trees of great age and bulk and an unkempt lawn strewn with bushes and beyond in an open place bare of trees and illuminated faintly by the stars the shadow of a house black silent and forbidding that's it whispered the chauffeur i was here before the well is over there the young man gave a gasp of astonishment why he protested this is the carey place i should say we were lost we must have left the road an hour ago there's not another house within miles but he made no movement to enter of all places he muttered well then urged the girl briskly if there's no other house let's tap mr carey's well and get on do you know who he is asked the man the girl laughed you don't need a letter of introduction to take a bucket of water do you she said it's philip carey's house he lives here he spoke in a whisper and insistently as though the information must carry some special significance but the girl showed no sign of enlightenment you remember the carey boys he urged they left harvard the year i entered they had to leave they were quite mad all the careys have been mad the boys were queer even then and awfully rich henry ran away with a girl from a shoe factory in brockton and lives in paris and philip was sent here sent here repeated the girl unconsciously her voice also had sunk to a whisper he has a doctor and a nurse and keepers and they live here all the year round when fred said there were people hereabouts i thought we might strike them for something to eat or even to put us up for the night but philip carey i shouldn't fancy i should think not exclaimed the girl for a minute the three stood silent peering through the iron bars and the worst of it is went on the young man irritably he could give us such good things to eat it doesn't look it said the girl i know continued the man in the same eager whisper but who was it was telling me some doctor i know who came down to see him he said carey does himself awfully well has the house full of bully pictures and the family plate and wonderful collections things he picked up in the east gold ornaments and jewels and jade i shouldn't think said the girl in the same hushed voice they would let him live so far from any neighbors with such things in the house suppose burglars burglars burglars would never hear of this place how could they even his friends think it's just a private madhouse the girl shivered and drew back from the gate fred coughed apologetically i've heard of it he volunteered there was a piece in the sunday post it said he eats his dinner in a diamond crown and all the walls is gold and two monkeys wait on table with gold nonsense said the man sharply he eats like any one else and dresses like any one else how far is the well from the house it's purty near said the chauffeur pretty near the house or pretty near here just outside the kitchen and it makes a creaky noise you mean you don't want to go fred's answer was unintelligible you wait here with miss forbes said the young man and i'll get the water yes sir said fred quite distinctly no sir said miss forbes with equal distinctness i'm not going to be left here alone with all these trees i'm going with you there may be a dog suggested the young man or i was thinking if they heard me prowling about they might take a shot just for luck why don't you go back to the car with fred down that long road in the dark exclaimed the girl do you think i have no imagination the man in front the girl close on his heels and the boy with the buckets following crawled through the broken gate and moved cautiously up the gravel driveway within fifty feet of the house the courage of the chauffeur returned you wait here he whispered and if i wake em up you shout to em that it's all right that it's only me your idea being said the young man that they will then fire at me clever lad run along there was a rustling of the dead weeds and instantly the chauffeur was swallowed in the encompassing shadows miss forbes leaned toward the young man do you see a light in that lower story she whispered no said the man where after a pause the girl answered i can't see it now either maybe i didn't see it it was very faint just a glow it might have been phosphorescence it might said the man he gave a shrug of distaste the whole place is certainly old enough and decayed enough for a brief space they stood quite still and at once accentuated by their own silence the noises of the night grew in number and distinctness a slight wind had risen and the boughs of the pines rocked restlessly making mournful complaint and at their feet the needles dropping in a gentle desultory shower had the sound of rain in springtime from every side they were startled by noises they could not place strange movements and rustlings caused them to peer sharply into the shadows footsteps that seemed to approach and then having marked them skulk away branches of bushes that suddenly swept together as though closing behind some one in stealthy retreat although they knew that in the deserted garden they were alone they felt that from the shadows they were being spied upon that the darkness of the place was peopled by malign presences the young man drew a cigar from his case and put it unlit between his teeth cheerful isn't it he growled these dead leaves make it damp as a tomb if i've seen one ghost i've seen a dozen i believe we're standing in the carey family's graveyard i thought you were brave said the girl i am returned the young man very brave but if you had the most wonderful girl on earth to take care of in the grounds of a madhouse at two in the morning you'd be scared too he was abruptly surprised by miss forbes laying her hand firmly upon his shoulder and turning him in the direction of the house her face was so near his that he felt the uneven fluttering of her breath upon his cheek there is a man she said standing behind that tree by the faint light of the stars he saw in black silhouette a shoulder and head projecting from beyond the trunk of a huge oak and then quickly withdrawn the owner of the head and shoulder was on the side of the tree nearest to themselves his back turned to them and so deeply was his attention engaged that he was unconscious of their presence he is watching the house said the girl why is he doing that i think it's fred whispered the man he's afraid to go for the water that's as far as he's gone he was about to move forward when from the oak"
