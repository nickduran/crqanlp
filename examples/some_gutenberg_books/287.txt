"1" "was one flush of joy and youth she had a look half earnest and half childlike and altogether charming antonia adored her and she was pleased to listen to the child telling over again the pretty things that had been said to her only don luis was not there at all antonia there is always something wanting and her voice fell with those sad inflections that are often only the very excess of delight the senora looked sharply at her don luis was not desirable he was better away much better but why because antonia he is suspected there is an american called houston don luis met him in nacogdoches he has given his soul to him i think he would have fought morello about him if the captain could have drawn his sword in such a quarrel i should not have known about the affair had not senora valdez told me your father says nothing against the americans perhaps then he knows nothing against them you will excuse me antonia not only the living but the dead must have heard of their wickedness they are a nation of ingrates ingrates are cowards it was these words captain morello said when don luis drew his sword made a circle with its point and stood it upright in the centre it was a challenge to the whole garrigon and about this fellow houston whom he calls his friend holy virgin preserve us from such mexicans it is easier to talk than to fight morello's tongue is sharper than his sword captain morello was placing his sword beside that of don luis when the commandant interfered he would not permit his officers to fight in such a quarrel santo dios he said you shall all have your opportunity very soon gentlemen just reflect upon the folly of a boy like don luis challenging a soldier like morello he was in no danger mother said antonia scornfully morello is a bully who wears the pavement out with his spurs and sabre his weapons are for show americans at least wear their arms for use and not for ornament listen antonia i will not have them spoken of they are jews or at least infidels all of them the devil himself is their father the bishop when he was here last confirmation told me so mother at least they are unbaptized christians antonia if you are not baptized the devil sends you to do his work as for don luis he is a very judas ah maria santissima how i do pity his good mother poor don luis said isabel plaintively he is so handsome and he sings like a very angel and he loves my father he wanted to be a doctor so that he could always be with him i dare say this man called houston is no better than a jew and perhaps very ugly beside let us talk no more about him and the americans i am weary of them as tia rachella says they have their spoon in every one's mess and antonia whose heart was burning only stooped down and closed her sister's pretty mouth with a kiss her tongue was impatient to speak for the father and grandmother and the friends so dear to her but she possessed great discretion and also a large share of that rarest of all womanly graces the power under provocation of putting on patience the noble chapter iii builders of the commonwealth methinks i see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks methinks i see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth and kindling her undazzled eye in the full mid day beam milton and from these grounds concluding as we doe warres causes diuerse so by consequence diuerse we must conclude their natures too for war proceeding from omnipotence no doubt is holy wise and without error the sword of justice and of sin the terror lord brooke it is the fashion now to live for the present but the men of fifty years ago the men who builded the nation they reverenced the past and therefore they could work for the future as robert worth rode through the streets of san antonio that afternoon he was thinking not of his own life but of his children's and of the generations which should come after them the city was flooded with sunshine and crowded with a pack train going to sonora the animals restlessly protesting against the heat and flies their mexican drivers in the pulqueria spending their last peso with their compadres or with the escort of soldiers which was to accompany them a little squad of small lithe men with round yellow beardless faces bearing in a singular degree the stamp of being native to the soil their lieutenant a gorgeously clad officer with a very distinguished air was coming slowly down the street to join them he bowed and smiled pleasantly to the doctor as he passed him and then in a few moments the word of command and the shouting of men and the clatter of hoofs invaded the enchanted atmosphere like an insult but the tumult scarcely jarred with the thoughts of his mind they had been altogether of war and rumors of war every hour that subtile consciousness of coming events which makes whole communities at times prescient was becoming stronger if the powers of the air have anything to do with the destinies of men he muttered there must be unseen battalions around me the air i am breathing is charged with the feeling of battle after leaving the city there were only a few mexican huts on the shady road leading to his own house all within them were asleep even the fighting cocks tied outside were dozing on their perches he was unusually weary he had been riding since dawn and his heart had not been in sympathy with his body it had said no good cheer to it whispered no word of courage or promise all at once his physical endurance seemed exhausted and he saw the white wall and arched gateway of his garden and the turrets of his home with an inexpressible relief but it was the hour of siesta and he was always careful not to let the requirements of his profession disturb his household so he rode quietly to the rear where he found a peon nodding within the stable door he opened his eyes unnaturally wide and rose to serve his master see thou rub the mare well down and give her corn and water to be sure senior that is to be done a stranger has been here to day an american what did he say to thee that he would call again senor the incident was not an unusual one and it did not trouble the doctor's mind there was on the side of the house a low extension containing two rooms these rooms belonged exclusively to him one was his study his office his covert the place to which he went when he wanted to be alone with his own soul there were a bed and bath and refreshments in the other room he went directly to it and after eating and washing fell into a profound sleep at the hour before angelus the house was as noisy and busy as if it had been an inn the servants were running hither and thither all of them expressing themselves in voluble spanish the cooks were quarrelling in the kitchen antonia was showing the table men as she had to do afresh every day how to lay the cloth and serve the dishes in the american fashion when the duty was completed she went into the garden to listen for the angelus the young ladies of to day would doubtless consider her toilet frightfully unbecoming but antonia looked lovely in it though but a white muslin frock with a straight skirt and low waist and short full sleeves it was confined by a blue belt with a gold buckle and her feet were in sandalled slippers of black satin the angelus tolled and the thousands of hail maries which blended with its swinging vibrations were uttered and left to their fate as all spoken words must be antonia still observed the form it lent for a moment a solemn beauty to her face she was about to re enter the house when she saw a stranger approaching it he was dressed in a handsome buckskin suit and a wide mexican hat but she knew at once that he was an american and she waited to receive him as soon as he saw her he removed his hat and approached with it in his hand perhaps he was conscious that the act not only did homage to womanhood but revealed more perfectly a face of remarkable beauty and nobility for the rest he was very tall powerfully built elegantly proportioned and his address had the grace and polish of a cultured gentleman i wish to see dr worth dona with a gentle inclination of the head she led him to the door of her father's office she was the only one in the doctor's family at all familiar with the room the senora said so many books made her feel as if she were in a church or monastery she was afraid to say anything but paternosters in it isabel cowered before the poor skeleton in the corner and the centipedes and snakes that filled the bottles on the shelves there was not a servant that would enter the room but antonia did not regard books as a part of some vague spiritual power she knew the history of the skeleton she had seen the death of many of those little devils corked up in alcohol she knew that at this hour if her father were at home he was always disengaged and she opened the door fearlessly saying father here is a gentleman who wishes to see you the doctor had quite refreshed himself and in a house suit of clean white linen was lying on a couch reading he arose with alacrity and with his pleasant smile seemed to welcome the intruder as he stepped behind him and closed the door antonia had disappeared they were quite alone you are doctor robert worth sir their eyes met their souls knew each other and you are sam houston the questions were answered in a hand grip a sympathetic smile on both faces the freemasonry of kindred spirits i have a letter from your son thomas doctor and i think also that you will have something to say to me and i to you the most prudent of patriots could not have resisted this man he had that true imperial look which all born rulers of men possess that look that half coerces and wholly persuades robert worth acknowledged its power by his instant and decisive answer i have indeed much to say to you we shall have dinner directly then you will give the night to me after a short conversation he led him into the sala and introduced him to antonia he himself had to prepare the senora for her visitor and he had a little quaking of the heart as he entered her room she was dressed for dinner and turned with a laughing face to meet him i have been listening to the cooks quarrelling over the olla roberto but what can my poor manuel say when your irishwoman attacks him listen to her take your dirty stew aff the fire then shure it isn't fit for a christian to ate at all i hope it is maria for we have a visitor to night who then my love mr houston sam houston holy virgin of guadalupe preserve us i will not see the man i think you will maria he has brought this letter for you from our son thomas and he has been so kind as to take charge of some fine horses and sell them well for him in san antonio when a man does us a kindness we should say thank you that is truth if the man is not the evil one as for this sam houston you should have heard what was said of him at the valdez's i did hear everything was a lie but he is a very common man maria do you call a soldier a lawyer a member of the united states congress a governor of a great state like tennessee a common man houston has been all of these things it is however true that he has lived with indians and with those americans who are bad who have no god who are infidels and perhaps even cannibals if he is a good man why does he live with bad men not even the saints could do that a good man should be in his home why does he not stay at home alas maria that is a woman's fault he loved a beautiful girl he married her my dear one she did not bless his life as you have blessed mine no one knows what his sorrow was for he told no one and he never blamed her only he left his high office and turned his back forever on his home ah the cruel woman holy virgin what hard hearts thou hast to pray for come down and smile upon him maria i should like him to see a high born mexican lady are they not the kindest and fairest among all god's women i know at least maria that you are kind and fair and he took her hands and drew her within his embrace what good wife can resist her husband's wooing maria did not she lifted her face her eyes shone through happy tears she whispered softly my robert it is a joy to please you i will be kind i will be grateful about thomas you shall see that i will make a pleasant evening so the triumphant husband went down proud and happy with his smiling wife upon his arm isabel was already in the room she also wore a white frock but her hair was pinned back with gold butterflies and she had a beautiful golden necklace around her throat and the senora kept her word she paid her guest great attention she talked to him of his adventures with the indians she requested her daughters to sing to him she told him stories of the old castilian families with which she was connected and described her visit to new orleans with a great deal of pleasant humor she felt that she was doing herself justice that she was charming and consequently she also was charmed with the guest and the occasion which had been so favorable to her after the ladies had retired the doctor led his visitor into his study he sat down silently and placed a chair for houston both men hesitated for a moment to open the conversation worth because he was treading on unknown ground houston because he did not wish to force even by a question a resolution which he felt sure would come voluntarily the jar of tobacco stood between them and they filled their pipes silently then worth laid a letter upon the table and said i unstand sic from this that my son thomas thinks the time has come for decisive action thomas worth is right with such souls as his the foundation of the state must be laid i am glad thomas has taken the position he has but you must remember sir that he is unmarried and unembarrassed by many circumstances which render decisive movement on my part a much more difficult thing yet no man now living has watched the americanizing of texas with the interest that i have you have been long on the watch sir i was here when my countrymen came first in little companies of five or ten men i saw the party of twenty who joined the priest hidalgo in eighteen hundred and ten when mexico made her first attempt to throw off the spanish yoke an unsuccessful attempt yes the next year i made a pretended professional journey to chihuahua to try and save their lives i failed they were shot with hidalgo there yet the strife for liberty went on it did two years afterwards magee and bernardo with twelve hundred americans raised the standard of independence on the trinity river i saw them them sic take this very city though it was ably defended by salcedo they fought like heroes i had many of the wounded in my house i succored them with my purse it was a great deed for a handful of men the fame of it brought young americans by hundreds here to a man they joined the mexican party struggling to free themselves from the tyranny of old spain i do not think any one of them received money the love of freedom and the love of adventure were alike their motive and their reward mexico owed these men a debt she has forgotten she forgot it very quickly in the following year though they had again defended san antonio against the spaniards the mexicans drove all the americans out of the city their rifles had saved you were here tell me the true reason it was not altogether ingratitude it was the instinct of self preservation the very bravery of the americans made the men whom they had defended hate and fear them and there was a continual influx of young men from the states the mexicans said to each other there is no end to these americans very soon they will make a quarrel and turn their arms against us they do not conform to our customs and they will not take an order from any officer but their own houston smiled it is away the saxon race has he said the old britons made the same complaint of them they went first to england to help the britons fight the romans and they liked the country so well they determined to stay there if i remember rightly the old britons had to let them do so it is an old political situation you can go back to genesis and find pharaoh arguing about the jews in the same manner what happened after this forcible expulsion of the american element from texas mexican independence was for a time abandoned and the spanish viceroys were more tyrannical than ever but americans still came though they pursued different tactics they bought land and settled on the great rivers in eighteen twenty one austin with the permission of the spanish viceroy in mexico introduced three hundred families that was a step in the right direction but i am astonished the viceroy sanctioned it apodoca who was then viceroy was a spaniard of the proudest type he had very much the same contempt for the mexicans that an old english viceroy in new york had for the colonists he was sent to govern i dare say any of them would have permitted three hundred german families to settle in some part of british america as far from new york as texas is from mexico i do not need to tell you that austin's colonists are a band of choice spirits hardy working men trained in the district schools of new england and new york nearly every one of them a farmer or mechanic they were the very material liberty needed they have made homes that is the truth the fighters who preceded them owned nothing but their horses and their rifles but these men brought with them their wives and their children their civilization their inborn love of freedom and national faith they accepted the guarantee of the spanish government and they expected the spanish government to keep its promises it did not it had no opportunity the colonists were hardly settled when the standard of revolt against spain was again raised santa anna took the field for a republican form of government and once more a body of americans under the tennesseean long joined the mexican army i remember that well in eighteen twenty four santa anna victoria and bravo drove the spaniards forever from mexico and then they promulgated the famous constitution of eighteen twenty four it was a noble constitution purely democratic and federal and the texan colonists to a man gladly swore to obey it the form was altogether elective and what particularly pleased the american element was the fact that the local government of every state was left to itself houston laughed heartily do you know worth he said state rights is our political religion the average american citizen would expect the almighty to conform to a written constitution and recognize the rights of mankind i don't think he expects more than he gets houston where is there a grander constitution than is guaranteed to us in his word or one that more completely recognizes the rights of all humanity thank you worth i see that i have spoken better than i knew i was sitting in the united states congress when this constitution passed and very much occupied with the politics of tennessee i will not detain you with mexican politics it may be briefly said that for the last ten years there has been a constant fight between pedraza guerrero bustamante and santa anna for the presidency of mexico after so much war and misery the country is now ready to resign all the blessings the constitution of eighteen twenty four promised her for peace she is willing to have a dictator in santa anna if mexicans want a dictator let them bow down to santa anna but do you think the twenty thousand free born americans in texas are going to have a dictator they will have the constitution of eighteen twenty four or they will have independence and make their own constitution yes sir you know the men for whom you speak i have been up and down among them for two years just after i came to texas i was elected to the convention which sent stephen austin to mexico with a statement of our wrongs did we get any redress no sir and as for poor austin is he not in the dungeons of the inquisition we have waited two years for an answer great heavens doctor surely that is long enough was this convention a body of any influence influence there were men there whose names will never be forgotten they met in a log house they wore buckskin and homespun but i tell you sir they were debating the fate of unborn millions two years since austin went to mexico a two years chapter of tyranny in them santa anna has quite overthrown the republic of which we were a part he has made himself dictator and because our authorities have protested against the change they have been driven from office by a military force i tell you sir the petty outrages everywhere perpetrated by petty officials have filled the cup of endurance it is boiling over now doctor what are you going to do are you with us or against us i have told you that i have been with my countrymen always heart and soul with them the doctor spoke with some irritation and houston laid his closed hand hard upon the table to emphasize his reply heart and soul very good but we want your body now you must tuck your bowie knife and your revolvers in your belt and take your rifle in your hand and be ready to help us drive the mexican force out of this very city when it comes to that i shall be no laggard but he was deathly pale for he was suffering as men suffer who feel the sweet bonds of wife and children and home and dread the rending of them apart in a moment however the soul behind his white face made it visibly luminous houston he said whenever the cause of freedom needs me i am ready i shall want no second call but is it not possible that even yet it is impossible to avert what is already here within a few days perhaps to morrow you will hear the publication of an edict from santa anna ordering every american to give up his arms what give up our arms no no by heaven i will die fighting for mine rather exactly that is how every white man in texas feels about it and if such a wonder as a coward existed among them he understands that he may as well die fighting mexicans as die of hunger or be scalped by indians a large proportion of the colonists depend on their rifles for their daily food all of them know that they must defend their own homes from the comanche or see them perish now do you imagine that americans will obey any such order by all the great men of seventeen seventy five if they did i would go over to the mexicans and help them to wipe the degenerate cowards out of existence he rose as he spoke he looked like a flame and his words cut like a sword worth caught fire at his vehemence and passion he clasped his hands in sympathy as he walked with him to the door they stood silently together for a moment on the threshold gazing into the night over the glorious land the full moon hung enamoured into the sweet warm air mockingbirds were pouring low broken songs of ineffable melody the white city in the mystical light looked like an enchanted city it was so still that the very houses looked asleep it is a beautiful land said the doctor it is worthy of freedom answered houston then he went with long swinging steps down the garden and into the shadows beyond and worth turned in and closed the door he had been watching for this very hour for twenty years and yet he found himself wholly unprepared for it like one led by confused and uncertain thoughts he went about the room mechanically locking up his papers and the surgical instruments he valued so highly as he did so he perceived the book he had been reading when houston entered it was lying open where he had laid it down a singular smile flitted over his face he lifted it and carried it closer to the light it was his college cicero i was nineteen years old when i marked that passage he said and i do not think i have ever read it since until to night i was reading it when houston came into the room is it a message i wonder but when thou considerest everything carefully and thoughtfully of all societies none is of more importance none more dear than that which unites us with the commonwealth our parents children relations and neighbors are dear but our fatherland embraces the whole round of these endearments in its defence who would not dare to die if only he could assist it chapter iv the shining bands of love o blest be he o blest be he let him all blessings prove who made the chains the shining chains the holy chains of love spanish ballad if you love a lady bright seek and you shall find a way all that love would say to say if you watch the occasion right spanish ballad in the morning isabel took breakfast with her sister this was always a pleasant event to antonia she petted isabel she waited upon her sweetened her chocolate spread her cakes with honey and listened to all her complaints of tia rachela isabel came gliding in when antonia was about half way through the meal her scarlet petticoat was gorgeous her bodice white as snow her hair glossy as a bird's wing but her lips drooped and trembled and there was the shadow of tears in her eyes antonia kissed their white fringed lids held the little form close in her arms and fluttered about in that motherly way which isabel had learned to demand and enjoy what has grieved you this morning little dove it is tia rachela as usual the cross old woman she is going to tell mi madre something antonia you must make her keep her tongue between her teeth i promised her to confess to fray ignatius and she said i must also tell mi madre i vowed to say twenty hail marias and ten glorias and she said i ought to go back to the convent but what dreadful thing have you been doing iza iza blushed and looked into her chocolate cup as she answered slowly i gave a flower away only a suchil flower antonia that i wore at my breast last night whom did you give it to iza iza hesitated moved her chair close to antonia and then hid her face on her sister's breast but this is serious darling surely you did not give it to senor houston could you think i was so silly when madre was talking to him last night and when i was singing my pretty serenade he heard nothing at all he was thinking his own thoughts not to senor houston who then tell me iza to don luis don luis but he is not here he went to the colorado how stupid are you antonia in new york they did not teach you to put this and that together as soon as i saw senor houston i said to myself don luis"
