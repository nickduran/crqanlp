"1" "while a handful of leaden ones those sold on the streets for the constitutional centennial with which albert had provided himself were wrapped up in a red silk handkerchief for presentation to the king with them albert placed a number of brass rods and brass chains much to stedman's delighted approval that is a very good idea he said democratic simplicity is the right thing at home of course but when you go abroad and mix with crowned heads you want to show them that you know what's what well said albert gravely i sincerely hope this crowned head don't know what's what if he reads connecticut agricultural state fair one mile bicycle race first prize on this badge when we are trying to make him believe it's a war medal it may hurt his feelings bradley jr went ahead to announce the approach of the american embassy which he did with so much manner that the king deferred the audience a half hour in order that he might better prepare to receive his visitors when the audience did take place it attracted the entire population to the green spot in front of the king's palace and their delight and excitement over the appearance of the visitors was sincere and hearty the king was too polite to appear much surprised but he showed his delight over his presents as simply and openly as a child thrice he insisted on embracing albert and kissing him three times on the forehead which stedman assured him in a side whisper was a great honor an honor which was not extended to the secretary although he was given a necklace of animals claws instead with which he was better satisfied after this reception the embassy marched back to the consul's office surrounded by an immense number of the natives some of whom ran ahead and looked back at them and crowded so close that the two bradleys had to poke at those nearest with their guns the crowd remained outside the office even after the procession of four had disappeared and cheered this suggested to gordon that this would be a good time to make a speech which he accordingly did stedman translating it sentence by sentence at the conclusion of this effort albert distributed a number of brass rings among the married men present which they placed on whichever finger fitted best and departed delighted albert had wished to give the rings to the married women but stedman pointed out to him that it would be much cheaper to give them to the married men for while one woman could only have one husband one man could have at least six wives and now stedman said albert after the mob had gone tell me what you are doing on this island it's a very simple story stedman said i am the representative or agent or operator for the yokohama cable company the yokohama cable company is a company organized in san francisco for the purpose of laying a cable to yokohama it is a stock company and though it started out very well the stock has fallen very low between ourselves it is not worth over three or four cents when the officers of the company found out that no one would buy their stock and that no one believed in them or their scheme they laid a cable to octavia and extended it on to this island then they said they had run out of ready money and would wait until they got more before laying their cable any farther i do not think they ever will lay it any farther but that is none of my business my business is to answer cable messages from san francisco so that the people who visit the home office can see that at least a part of the cable is working that sometimes impresses them and they buy stock there is another chap over in octavia who relays all my messages and all my replies to those messages that come to me through him from san francisco they never send a message unless they have brought someone to the office whom they want to impress and who they think has money to invest in the y.c.c stock and so we never go near the wire except at three o'clock every afternoon and then generally only to say how are you or it's raining or something like that i've been saying it's raining now for the last three months but to day i will say that the new consul has arrived that will be a pleasant surprise for the chap in octavia for he must be tired hearing about the weather he generally answers here too or so you said or something like that i don't know what he says to the home office he's brighter than i am and that's why they put him between the two ends he can see that the messages are transmitted more fully and more correctly in a way to please possible subscribers sort of copy editor suggested albert yes something of that sort i fancy said stedman they walked down to the little shed on the shore where the y.c.c office was placed at three that day and albert watched stedman send off his message with much interest the chap at octavia on being informed that the american consul had arrived at opeki inquired somewhat disrespectfully is it a life sentence what does he mean by that asked albert i suppose said his secretary doubtfully that he thinks it a sort of a punishment to be sent to opeki i hope you won't grow to think so opeki is all very well said gordon or it will be when we get things going our way as they walked back to the office albert noticed a brass cannon perched on a rock at the entrance to the harbor this had been put there by the last consul but it had not been fired for many years albert immediately ordered the two bradleys to get it in order and to rig up a flag pole beside it for one of his american flags which they were to salute every night when they lowered it at sundown and when we are not using it he said the king can borrow it to celebrate with if he doesn't impose on us too often the royal salute ought to be twenty one guns i think but that would use up too much powder so he will have to content himself with two did you notice asked stedman that night as they sat on the veranda of the consul's house in the moonlight how the people bowed to us as we passed yes albert said he had noticed it why well they never saluted me replied stedman that sign of respect is due to the show we made at the reception it is due to us in any event said the consul severely i tell you my secretary that we as the representatives of the united states government must be properly honored on this island we must become a power and we must do so without getting into trouble with the king we must make them honor him too and then as we push him up we will push ourselves up at the same time they don't think much of consuls in opeki said stedman doubtfully you see the last one was a pretty poor sort he brought the office into disrepute and it wasn't really until i came and told them what a fine country the united states was that they had any opinion of it at all now we must change all that that is just what we will do said albert we will transform opeki into a powerful and beautiful city we will make these people work they must put up a palace for the king and lay out streets and build wharves and drain the town properly and light it i haven't seen this patent lighting apparatus of yours but you had better get to work at it at once and i'll persuade the king to appoint you commissioner of highways and gas with authority to make his people toil and i he cried in free enthusiasm will organize a navy and a standing army only he added with a relapse of interest there isn't anybody to fight there isn't said stedman grimly with a scornful smile you just go hunt up old messenwah and the hillmen with your standing army once and you'll get all the fighting you want the hillmen said albert the hillmen are the natives that live up there in the hills stedman said nodding his head toward the three high mountains at the other end of the island that stood out blackly against the purple moonlit sky there are nearly as many of them as there are opekians and they hunt and fight for a living and for the pleasure of it they have an old rascal named messenwah for a king and they come down here about once every three months and tear things up albert sprang to his feet oh they do do they he said staring up at the mountain tops they come down here and tear up things do they well i think we'll stop that i think we'll stop that i don't care how many there are i'll get the two bradleys to tell me all they know about drilling to morrow morning and we'll drill these opekians and have sham battles and attacks and repulses until i make a lot of wild howling zulus out of them and when the hillmen come down to pay their quarterly visit they'll go back again on a run at least some of them will he added ferociously some of them will stay right here dear me dear me said stedman with awe you are a born fighter aren't you well you wait and see said gordon maybe i am i haven't studied tactics of war and the history of battles so that i might be a great war correspondent without learning something and there is only one king on this island and that is old ollypybus himself and i'll go over and have a talk with him about it to morrow young stedman walked up and down the length of the veranda in and out of the moonlight with his hands in his pockets and his head on his chest you have me all stirred up gordon he said you seem so confident and bold and you're not so much older than i am either my training has been different that's all said the reporter yes stedman said bitterly i have been sitting in an office ever since i left school sending news over a wire or a cable and you have been out in the world gathering it and now said gordon smiling and putting his arm around the other boy's shoulders we are going to make news ourselves there is one thing i want to say to you before you turn in said stedman before you suggest all these improvements on ollypybus you must remember that he has ruled absolutely here for twenty years and that he does not think much of consuls he has only seen your predecessor and yourself he likes you because you appeared with such dignity and because of the presents but if i were you i wouldn't suggest these improvements as coming from yourself i don't understand said gordon who could they come from well said stedman if you will allow me to advise and you see i know these people pretty well i would have all these suggestions come from the president direct the president exclaimed gordon but how what does the president know or care about opeki and it would take so long oh i see the cable is that what you have been doing he asked well only once said stedman guiltily that was when he wanted to turn me out of the consul's office and i had a cable that very afternoon from the president ordering me to stay where i was ollypybus doesn't understand the cable of course but he knows that it sends messages and sometimes i pretend to send messages for him to the president but he began asking me to tell the president to come and pay him a visit and i had to stop it i'm glad you told me said gordon the president shall begin to cable to morrow he will need an extra appropriation from congress to pay for his private cablegrams alone and there's another thing said stedman in all your plans you've arranged for the people's improvement but not for their amusement and they are a peaceful jolly simple sort of people and we must please them have they no games or amusements of their own asked gordon well not what we would call games very well then i'll teach them base ball foot ball would be too warm but that plaza in front of the king's bungalow where his palace is going to be is just the place for a diamond on the whole though added the consul after a moment's reflection you'd better attend to that yourself i don't think it becomes my dignity as american consul to take off my coat and give lessons to young opekians in sliding to bases do you no i think you'd better do that the bradleys will help you and you had better begin to morrow you have been wanting to know what a secretary of legation's duties are and now you know it's to organize base ball nines and after you get yours ready he added as he turned into his room for the night i'll train one that will sweep yours off the face of the island for this american consul can pitch three curves the best laid plans of men go far astray sometimes and the great and beautiful city that was to rise on the coast of opeki was not built in a day nor was it ever built for before the bradleys could mark out the foul lines for the base ball field on the plaza or teach their standing army the goose step or lay bamboo pipes for the water mains or clear away the cactus for the extension of the king's palace the hillmen paid opeki their quarterly visit albert had called on the king the next morning with stedman as his interpreter as he had said he would and with maps and sketches had shown his majesty what he proposed to do toward improving opeki and ennobling her king and when the king saw albert's free hand sketches of wharves with tall ships lying at anchor and rows of opekian warriors with the bradleys at their head and the design for his new palace and a royal sedan chair he believed that these things were already his and not still only on paper and he appointed albert his minister of war stedman his minister of home affairs and selected two of his wisest and oldest subjects to serve them as joint advisers his enthusiasm was even greater than gordon's because he did not appreciate the difficulties he thought gordon a semi god a worker of miracles and urged the putting up of a monument to him at once in the public plaza to which albert objected on the ground that it would be too suggestive of an idol and to which stedman also objected but for the less unselfish reason that it would be in the way of the pitcher's box they were feverishly discussing all these great changes and stedman was translating as rapidly as he could translate the speeches of four different men for the two counsellors had been called in all of whom wanted to speak at once when there came from outside a great shout and the screams of women and the clashing of iron and the pattering footsteps of men running as they looked at one another in startled surprise a native ran into the room followed by bradley jr and threw himself down before the king while he talked beating his hands and bowing before ollypybus bradley jr pulled his forelock to the consul and told how this man lived on the far outskirts of the village how he had been captured while out hunting by a number of the hillmen and how he had escaped to tell the people that their old enemies were on the war path again and rapidly approaching the village outside the women were gathering in the plaza with the children about them and the men were running from hut to hut warning their fellows and arming themselves with spears and swords and the native bows and arrows they might have waited until we had that army trained said gordon in a tone of the keenest displeasure tell me quick what do they generally do when they come steal all the cattle and goats and a woman or two and set fire to the huts in the outskirts replied stedman well we must stop them said gordon jumping up we must take out a flag of truce and treat with them they must be kept off until i have my army in working order it is most inconvenient if they had only waited two months now or six weeks even we could have done something but now we must make peace tell the king we are going out to fix things with them and tell him to keep off his warriors until he learns whether we succeed or fail but gordon gasped stedman albert you don't understand why man this isn't a street fight or a cane rush they'll stick you full of spears dance on your body and eat you maybe a flag of truce you're talking nonsense what do they know of a flag of truce you're talking nonsense too said albert and you're talking to your superior officer if you are not with me in this go back to your cable and tell the man in octavia that it's a warm day and that the sun is shining but if you've any spirit in you and i think you have run to the office and get my winchester rifles and the two shotguns and my revolvers and my uniform and a lot of brass things for presents and run all the way there and back and make time play you're riding a bicycle at the agricultural fair stedman did not hear this last for he was already off and away pushing through the crowd and calling on bradley sr to follow him bradley jr looked at gordon with eyes that snapped like a dog that is waiting for his master to throw a stone i can fire a winchester sir he said old tom can't he's no good at long range cept with a big gun sir don't give him the winchester give it to me please sir albert met stedman in the plaza and pulled off his blazer and put on captain travis's now his uniform coat and his white pith helmet now jack he said get up there and tell these people that we are going out to make peace with these hillmen or bring them back prisoners of war tell them we are the preservers of their homes and wives and children and you bradley take these presents and young bradley keep close to me and carry this rifle stedman's speech was hot and wild enough to suit a critical and feverish audience before a barricade in paris and when he was through gordon and bradley punctuated his oration by firing off the two winchester rifles in the air at which the people jumped and fell on their knees and prayed to their several gods the fighting men of the village followed the four white men to the outskirts and took up their stand there as stedman told them to do and the four walked on over the roughly hewn road to meet the enemy gordon walked with bradley jr in advance stedman and old tom bradley followed close behind with the two shot guns and the presents in a basket are these hillmen used to guns asked gordon stedman said no they were not this shot gun of mine is the only one on the island he explained and we never came near enough them before to do anything with it it only carries a hundred yards the opekians never make any show of resistance they are quite content if the hillmen satisfy themselves with the outlying huts as long as they leave them and the town alone so they seldom come to close quarters the four men walked on for half an hour or so in silence peering eagerly on every side but it was not until they had left the woods and marched out into the level stretch of grassy country that they came upon the enemy the hillmen were about forty in number and were as savage and ugly looking giants as any in a picture book they had captured a dozen cows and goats and were driving them on before them as they advanced farther upon the village when they saw the four men they gave a mixed chorus of cries and yells and some of them stopped and others ran forward shaking their spears and shooting their broad arrows into the ground before them a tall gray bearded muscular old man with a skirt of feathers about him and necklaces of bones and animals claws around his bare chest ran in front of them and seemed to be trying to make them approach more slowly is that messenwah asked gordon yes said stedman he is trying to keep them back i don't believe he ever saw a white man before stedman said albert speaking quickly give your gun to bradley and go forward with your arms in the air and waving your handkerchief and tell them in their language that the king is coming if they go at you bradley and i will kill a goat or two to show them what we can do with the rifles and if that don't stop them we will shoot at their legs and if that don't stop them i guess you'd better come back and we'll all run stedman looked at albert and albert looked at stedman and neither of them winced or flinched is this another of my secretary's duties asked the younger boy yes said the consul but a resignation is always in order you needn't go if you don't like it you see you know the language and i don't but i know how to shoot and you don't that's perfectly satisfactory said stedman handing his gun to old bradley i only wanted to know why i was to be sacrificed instead of one of the bradleys it's because i know the language bradley sr you see the evil results of a higher education wish me luck please he said and for goodness sake he added impressively don't waste much time shooting goats the hillmen had stopped about two hundred yards off and were drawn up in two lines shouting and dancing and hurling taunting remarks at their few adversaries the stolen cattle were bunched together back of the king as stedman walked steadily forward with his handkerchief fluttering and howling out something in their own tongue they stopped and listened as he advanced his three companions followed him at about fifty yards in the rear he was one hundred and fifty yards from the hillmen before they made out what he said and then one of the young braves resenting it as an insult to his chief shot an arrow at him stedman dodged the arrow and stood his ground without even taking a step backward only turning slightly to put his hands to his mouth and to shout something which sounded to his companions like about time to begin on the goats but the instant the young man had fired king messenwah swung his club and knocked him down and none of the others moved then messenwah advanced before his men to meet stedman and on stedman's opening and shutting his hands to show that he was unarmed the king threw down his club and spears and came forward as empty handed as himself ah gasped bradley jr with his finger trembling on his lever let me take a shot at him now gordon struck the man's gun up and walked forward in all the glory of his gold and blue uniform for both he and stedman saw now that messenwah was more impressed by their appearance and in the fact that they were white men than with any threats of immediate war so when he saluted gordon haughtily that young man gave him a haughty nod in return and bade stedman tell the king that he would permit him to sit down the king did not quite appear to like this but he sat down nevertheless and nodded his head gravely now tell him said gordon that i come from the ruler of the greatest nation on earth and that i recognize ollypybus as the only king of this island and that i come to this little three penny king with either peace and presents or bullets and war have i got to tell him he's a little three penny king said stedman plaintively no you needn't give a literal translation it can be as free as you please thanks said the secretary humbly and tell him continued gordon that we will give presents to him and his warriors if he keeps away from ollypybus and agrees to keep away always if he won't do that try to get him to agree to stay away for three months at least and by that time we can get word to san francisco and have a dozen muskets over here in two months and when our time of probation is up and he and his merry men come dancing down the hillside we will blow them up as high as his mountains but you needn't tell him that either and if he is proud and haughty and would rather fight ask him to restrain himself until we show what we can do with our weapons at two hundred yards stedman seated himself in the long grass in front of the king and with many revolving gestures of his arms and much pointing at gordon and profound nods and bows retold what gordon had dictated when he had finished the king looked at the bundle of presents and at the guns of which stedman had given a very wonderful account but answered nothing i guess said stedman with a sigh that we will have to give him a little practical demonstration to help matters i am sorry but i think one of those goats has got to die it's like vivisection the lower order of animals have to suffer for the good of the higher oh said bradley jr cheerfully i'd just as soon shoot one of those niggers as one of the goats so stedman bade the king tell his men to drive a goat toward them and the king did so and one of the men struck one of the goats with his spear and it ran clumsily across the plain take your time bradley said gordon aim low and if you hit it you can have it for supper and if you miss it said stedman gloomily messenwah may have us for supper the hillmen had seated themselves a hundred yards off while the leaders were debating and they now rose curiously and watched bradley as he sank upon one knee and covered the goat with his rifle when it was about one hundred and fifty yards off he fired and the goat fell over dead and then all the hillmen with the king himself broke away on a run toward the dead animal with much shouting the king came back alone leaving his people standing about and examining the goat he was much excited and talked and gesticulated violently he says said stedman he says what yes go on he says goodness me what do you think he says well what does he say cried gordon in great excitement don't keep it all to yourself he says said stedman that we are deceived that he is no longer king of the island of opeki that he is in great fear of us and that he has got himself into no end of trouble he says he sees that we are indeed mighty men that to us he is as helpless as the wild boar before the javelin of the hunter well he's right said gordon go on but that which we ask is no longer his to give he has sold his kingship and his right to this island to another king who came to him two days ago in a great canoe and who made noises as we do with guns i suppose he means and to whom he sold the island for a watch that he has in a bag around his neck and that he signed a paper and made marks on a piece of bark to show that he gave up the island freely and forever what does he mean said gordon how can he give up the island ollypybus is the king of half of it anyway and he knows it that's just it said stedman that's what frightens him he said he didn't care about ollypybus and didn't count him in when he made the treaty because he is such a peaceful"
