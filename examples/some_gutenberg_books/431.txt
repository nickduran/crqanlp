"1" "with several of his intimates at the irving place cafe where he could throw aside the heaviest parts of his pose and give way to his appetite for beer and schweizerkase sandwiches how happy we shall be he murmured tenderly kissing her cheek and thinking how hard it was to be practical and keep remote benefits in mind when she was so beautiful and so tempting and so trustful he said aloud i am impatient soul's delight is it strange and he bowed like a stage courtier to a stage queen and left her she joined sophie and heilig and walked along in silence sophie between otto and her he caught glimpses of her face and it made his heart ache and his courage faint to see the love light in her eyes and she as far away from him as heaven from hell far away in a world from which he was excluded he and sophie left her at her father's and he took sophie home sophie felt that she had done a fair evening's work not progress but progress in sight at least she reflected he's seeing that he isn't in it with hilda and never can be i must hurry her on and get her married to that fool a pair of fools heilig found his mother waiting up for him as she saw his expression anxiety left her face but cast a deeper shadow over her heart she felt his sorrow as keenly as he she who would have laid down her life for him gladly don't lose heart my big boy she said patting him on the shoulder as he bent to kiss her at this he dropped down beside her and hid his face in her lap and cried like the boy man that he was ach gott mother i love her so he sobbed her tears fell on the back of his head her boy who had gone so bravely to work when the father was killed at his machine leaving them penniless her boy who had laughed and sung and whistled and diffused hope and courage and made her feel that the burden was not a burden but a joy for his strong young shoulders courage beloved she said hilda is a good girl all will yet be well and she felt it god would not be god if he could let this heart of gold be crushed to powder iii fortune favors the impudent like all people who lead useful lives and neither have nor pretend to have acquired tastes for fine drawn emotion otto and hilda indulged in little mooning they put aside their burdens hers of dread his of despair and went about the work that had to be done and that healthfully filled almost all their waking moments and when bed time came their tired bodies refused either to sit up with their brains or to let their brains stay awake but it was gray and rainy for hilda and black night for otto on sunday morning he rose at half past three instead of at four his week day rising time many of his hard working customers were astir betimes on sunday to have the longer holiday as they would spend the daylight hours in the country and would not reach home until after the shop had closed they bought the supplies for a cold or warmed up supper before starting otto looked so sad usually he was in high spirits that most of these early customers spoke to him or to joe schwartz about his health there were few of them who did not know what was troubling him among those friendly and unpretending and well acquainted people any one's affairs were every one's affairs why make a secret of what was after all only the routine of human life the world over and the ages through thus otto had the lively but tactful sympathy of the whole community he became less gloomy under the warmth of this succession of friendly faces and friendly inquiries but as trade slackened toward noon he had more leisure to think and the throbbing ache returned to his heavy heart all the time pictures of her were passing before his eyes he had known her so long and she had become such an intimate part of his daily life so interwoven with it that he could not look at present past or future without seeing her why he had known her since she was a baby did he not remember the day when he a small boy on his way to school had seen her toddle across the sidewalk in front of him could he ever forget how she had reached with great effort into a snowbank had dug out with her small red mittened hands a chunk of snow and lifting it high above her head had thrown it weakly at him with such force that she had fallen headlong upon the sidewalk he had seen her every day since then every day he most clearly of all recalled her as a school girl those were the days of the german bands of six and seven and even eight pieces wandering as the hand organs do now and always with them came a swarm of little girls who danced when the band played and of little boys who listened and watched he had often followed her as she followed a band all day on a saturday and he had never wearied of watching her long slim legs twinkling tirelessly to the music she invented new figures and variations on steps which the other girls adopted she and her especial friends became famous among the children throughout the east side even grown people noted the grace and originality of a particular group of girls led by a black haired slim legged one who danced with all there was of her and how their mothers did whip them when they returned from a day of this forbidden joy but they were off again the next saturday who would not pass a bad five minutes for the sake of hours on hours of delight and hilda was gone from his life was sailing away on his ship was it not his ship was not its cargo his hopes and dreams and plans was sailing away with another man at the helm and he could do nothing must sit dumb upon the shore at half past twelve he closed the shop and after the midday dinner with his mother went down to brauner's hilda was in the room back of the shop alone and so agitated with her own affairs that she forgot to be cold and contemptuous to otto he bowed to her then stood staring at the framed picture of die wacht am rhein as if he had never before seen the wonderful lady in red and gold seated under a tree and gazing out over the river all the verses were underneath when he could stare at it no longer he turned to the other wall where hung the target bearing the marks of paul brauner's best shots in the prize contest he had won but he saw neither the lady watching the rhine nor the target with its bullet holes all in the bull's eye ring and its pendent festoon of medals he was longing to pour out his love for her to say to her the thousand things he could say to the image of her in his mind when she was not near but he could only stand an awkward figure at which she would have smiled if she had seen it at all she went out into the shop while he was still trying to lay hold of an end of the spinning tangle of his thoughts and draw it forth in the hope that all would follow she returned fright in her eyes she clasped her hands nervously and her cheeks blanched mr feuerstein she exclaimed and he's coming here what shall i do what is the matter he asked she turned upon him angrily he was the convenient vent for her nervousness it's all your fault she exclaimed they want to force me to marry you and i dare not bring here the man i love my fault he muttered dazed i'm not to blame stupid you're always in the way no wonder i hate you she was clasping and unclasping her hands trying to think not conscious of what she was saying hate me he repeated mechanically oh no surely not that no you can't be still let me think ach gott im himmel he's in the hall she sank wretchedly into a chair can you do nothing but gape and mutter in her desperation her tone was appealing he can say he came with me said otto i'll stand for him yes yes she cried that will do thank you thank you and as the knock came at the door she opened it she had intended to be reproachful but she could not this splendid romantic creature with his graceful hat and his golden hair and his velvet collar was too compelling too overpowering her adoring love put her at a hopeless disadvantage oh mr feuerstein she murmured her color coming and going with the rise and fall of her bosom mr feuerstein majestically removed his hat and turned a look of haughty inquiry upon otto otto's fists clenched he longed to discuss the situation in the only way which seemed to him to meet its requirements hilda said the actor when he thought there had been a long enough pause for an imposing entrance i have come to end the deception to make you before the world as you are before almighty god my affianced bride you you mustn't implored hilda her fears getting the better of her awe if my parents learn now just now they will oh it will be hopeless i can not delay angel of my heart he gave her the look that is the theatrical convention for love beyond words it must be settled at once i must know my fate i must put destiny to the touch and know happiness or hell bah thought otto he has to hurry matters he must be in trouble he's got to raise the wind at once mr feuerstein carl pleaded hilda please try to be practical she went up to him and otto turned away unable to bear the sight of that look of love tenderness and trust you must not at least not right away she turned to otto help me otto explain to him heilig tried to put courtesy in his voice as he said to mr feuerstein miss brauner is right you'll only wreck her her happiness we're plain people down here and don't understand these fine grand ways you must pass as my friend whom i brought here but i make one condition he drew a long breath and looked at hilda for the first time she heard him the real otto heilig speak hilda he went on i don't want to hurt you i'd do anything for you except hurt you and i can't stand for this fel for mr feuerstein unless you'll promise me you won't marry him no matter what he may say until your father has had a chance to find out who and what he is mr feuerstein drew himself up grandly who is this person miss brauner he demanded with haughty coldness he don't know any better she replied hurriedly he's an old friend trust me mr feuer carl everything depends on it i can not tolerate this coarse hand between me and the woman i love no more deception carl feuerstein how he did roll out that name can guard his own honor and his own destiny the door into the private hall opened and in came brauner and his wife fine pictures of homely content triumphing over the discomforts of sunday clothes they looked at mr feuerstein with candidly questioning surprise avenue a is not afraid to look and speak its mind otto came forward this is mr feuerstein he said at once brauner showed that he was satisfied and mrs brauner beamed oh a friend of yours brauner said extending his hand glad to see any friend of otto's mr feuerstein advanced impressively and bowed first over brauner's hand then over mrs brauner's i am not a friend of this young man he said with the dignity of a hoheit i have come here to propose for the honor of your daughter's hand in marriage mr feuerstein noted the stupefied expression of the delicatessen dealer and his wife and glanced from otto to hilda with a triumphant smile but hilda was under no delusion she shivered and moved nearer to otto she felt that he was her hope in this crisis which the mad love of her hero lover had forced brauner was the more angry because he had been thus taken by surprise what nonsense is this he growled shaking his head violently my daughter is engaged to a plain man like ourselves at this heilig came forward again pale and sad but calm no mr brauner she is not engaged i'm sure she loves this gentleman and i want her to be happy i can not be anything to her but her friend and i want you to give him a chance to show himself worthy of her brauner burst out furiously at hilda the very presence of this gaudy useless looking creature under his roof was an insult to his three gods of honor and happiness his arbeit und liebe und heim what does this mean he shouted where did you find this crazy fellow who brought him here hilda flared i love him father he's a noble good man i shall always love him listen to otto it'll break my heart if you frown on my marrying the man i love there was a touch of mr feuerstein in her words and tone let's have our game mr brauner interrupted otto all this can be settled afterward why spoil our afternoon brauner examined mr feuerstein who was posing as a statue of gloomy wrath who are you he demanded in the insulting tone which exactly expressed his state of mind mr feuerstein cast up his eyes for hilda's sake he murmured audibly then he made a great show of choking down his wrath i sir am of an ancient prussian family a gentleman i saw your peerless daughter sought an introduction careless who or what she was in birth and fortune love the leveler had conquered me i do you work brauner broke in what are your prospects what have you got what's your character have you any respectable friends who can vouch for you you've wandered into the wrong part of town down here we don't give our daughters to strangers or do nothings or rascals we believe in love yes but we also have a little common sense and self respect brauner flung this at mr feuerstein in high german hilda mortified and alarmed was also proud that her father was showing mr feuerstein that she came of people who knew something even if they were trades folk i can answer all your questions to your satisfaction replied mr feuerstein loftily with a magnanimous wave of his white hand my friends will speak for me and i shall give you the addresses of my noble relatives in germany though i greatly fear they will oppose my marriage you sir were born in the fatherland you know their prejudices don't trouble yourself said brauner ironically just take yourself off and spare yourself the disgrace of mingling with us plain folk hilda go to your room brauner pointed the stem of his pipe toward the outside door and looked meaningly at mr feuerstein hilda her eyes sparkling and her cheeks flushed put herself between mr feuerstein and the door i guess i've got something to say about that she exclaimed father you can't make me marry otto heilig i hate him i guess this is a free country i shall marry mr feuer carl she went up to him and put her arm through his and looked up at him lovingly he drew her to him protectingly and for an instant something of her passionate enthusiasm fired him or rather the actor in him otto laid his hand on brauner's arm don't you see sir he said in low german very earnestly that you're driving her to him i beg you in a lower tone for the sake of her future don't drive him out and her with him if he really would make her a good husband why not let her have him if he's not what he claims she won't have him brauner hesitated but she's yours her mother and i have promised we are people of our word but i won't marry her not unless she wishes it she herself and nothing can be done until this man has had a chance it was evident from brauner's face that he was yielding to this common sense hilda looked at otto gratefully thank you otto she said he shook his head mournfully and turned away brauner gave mr feuerstein a contemptuous glance perhaps otto's right he growled you can stay let us have our game otto mrs brauner hurried to the kitchen to make ready for four o'clock coffee and cake hilda arranged the table for pinochle and when her father and otto were seated motioned her lover to a seat beside her on the sofa heart's bride he said in a low tone i am prostrated by what i have borne for your sake i love you she said softly her young eyes shining like titania's when she was garlanding her ass headed lover you were right my beloved we shall win father is giving in he's very good natured and now he's used to the idea of our love otto lost the game and with his customary patience submitted to the customary lecture on his stupidity as a player brauner was once more in a good humor having agreed to tolerate mr feuerstein he was already taking a less unfavorable view of him and mr feuerstein laid himself out to win the owner of three tenements he talked german politics with him in high german and applauded his accent and his opinions he told stories of the old german emperor and bismarck and finally discovered that brauner was an ardent admirer of schiller he saw a chance to make a double stroke to please brauner and to feed his own vanity with your permission sir he said i will give a soliloquy from wallenstein brauner went to the door leading down the private hall mother he called come at once mr feuerstein's going to act hilda was bubbling over with delight otto sat forgotten in the corner mrs brauner came bustling her face rosy from the kitchen fire and her hands moist from a hasty washing mr feuerstein waited until all were seated in front of him he then rose and advanced with stately tread toward the clear space he rumpled his hair drew down his brows folded his arms and began a melancholy princely pacing of the floor with a suddenness that made them start he burst out thunderously he strode he roared he rolled his eyes he waved his arms he tore at his hair it was wallenstein in a soul sweat the floor creaked the walls echoed his ingenuous auditors except otto listened and looked with bated breath they were as vastly impressed as is a drawing room full of culture hunters farther up town when a man discourses to them on a subject of which he knows just enough for a wordy befuddling of their ignorance and the burst of applause which greeted the last bellowing groan was full as hearty as that which greets the bad singing or worse playing at the average musicale swollen with vanity and streaming with sweat mr feuerstein sat down good mr feuerstein ah it is grand said brauner hilda looked at her lover proudly otto felt that the recitation was idiotic nobody ever carried on like that he said to himself but he also felt the pitiful truth i haven't got a ghost of a chance he rose as soon as he could muster the courage i must get back and help schwartz open up he said looking round forlornly it's five o'clock you must stay to coffee insisted mrs brauner it should have been served before but mr feuerstein's exhibition had delayed it no i must work he replied it's five o'clock that's right said brauner with an approving nod business first i must go in myself and you too hilda the late sunday afternoon opening was for a very important trade hilda blushed the descent from the romantic to the practical jarred upon her but mr feuerstein rose and took leave most graciously may i return this evening he said to brauner always glad to see our friends answered brauner with a shamefaced apologetic look at otto at seven o'clock that evening otto just closing his shop saw mr feuerstein and hilda pass on their way toward tompkins square a few minutes later sophie came along she paused and tried to draw him into conversation but he answered briefly and absently gradually retreating into the darkness of his shop and pointedly drawing the door between him and her sophie went on her way downcast but not in the least disheartened when hilda is mrs feuerstein she said to herself iv a bold dash and a disaster mr feuerstein's evening was even more successful than his afternoon brauner was still grumbling mr feuerstein could not possibly be adjusted in his mind to his beloved ideals his religion of life arbeit und liebe und heim still he was yielding and hilda saw the signs of it she knew he was practically won over and was secretly inclined to be proud that his daughter had made this exalted conquest all men regard that which they do not know either with extravagant awe or with extravagant contempt while brauner had the universal human failing for attaching too much importance to the department of human knowledge in which he was thoroughly at home he had the american admiration for learning for literature and instead of spelling them with a very small l as practical men sometimes do with age and increasing vanity he spelled them with huge capitals erecting them into a position out of all proportion to their relative importance in the life of the human animal mr feuerstein had just enough knowledge to enable him to play upon this weakness this universal human susceptibility to the poison of pretense all doubt of success fled his mind and he was free to indulge his vanity and his contempt for these simple unpretending people so vulgar he said to himself as he left their house that night he who knew how to do nothing of use or value it is a great condescension for me working people ugh as he strolled up town he was spending in fancy the income from at least two perhaps all three flat houses the shop's enough for the old people and that dumb ass of a brother i'll elevate the family yes i think i'll run away with hilda to morrow that's the safest plan otto had guessed close to the truth about feuerstein's affairs they were in a desperate tangle he had been discharged from the stock company on saturday night he was worthless as an actor and had the hostility of the management and of his associates his landlady had got the news promptly from a boarder who paid in part by acting as a sort of mercantile agency for her in watching her very uncertain boarders she had given him a week's notice and had so arranged matters that if he fled he could not take his meager baggage he was down to eighty five cents of a borrowed dollar he owed money everywhere in sums ranging from five dollars to twenty five cents the most of these debts were in the form of half dollar borrowings he had begun his new york career with loans of five dollars until thursday i'm a little pressed soon it became impossible for him to get more than a dollar at a time even from the women except an occasional windfall through a weak or ignorant new acquaintance he clung tenaciously to the fifty cent basis to go lower would cheapen him but for the last two weeks his regular levies had been of twenty five cents with not a few descents to ten and even five cents he reached goerwitz's at ten o'clock and promenaded slowly through both rooms twice just as he was leaving he espied an acquaintance who was looking fiercely away from him as if saying i don't see you and damn you don't you dare see me but feuerstein advanced boldly twelve years of active membership in that band of beats which patrols every highway and byway and private way of civilization had thickened and toughened his skin into a hide good evening albers he said cordially with a wave of the soft light hat i see you have a vacant place in your little circle thank you he assumed that albers had invited him took a chair from another table and seated himself social courage is one of the rarest forms of courage albers grew red but did not dare insult such a fine looking fellow who seemed so hearty and friendly he surlily introduced feuerstein to his friends two women and two men feuerstein ordered a round of beer with the air of a prince and without the slightest intention of paying for it the young woman of the party was seated next to him even before he sat he recognized her as the daughter of ganser a rich brewer of the upper east side he had placed himself deliberately beside her and he at once began advances she showed at a glance that she was a silly vain girl her face was fat and dull she had thin stringy hair she was flabby and in the lazy life to which the gansers wealth and the silly customs of prosperous people condemned her was already beginning to expand in the places where she could least afford it he made amorous eyes at her he laughed enthusiastically at her foolish speeches he addressed his pompous platitudes exclusively to her within an hour he pressed her hand under the table and sighed dramatically when she looked at him he started and rolled his great eyes dreamily away never before had she received attentions that were not of the frankest and crudest practical nature she was all in a flutter at having thus unexpectedly come upon appreciation of the beauties and merits her mirror told her she possessed when mrs schoenberg her aunt rose to go she gave feuerstein a chance to say in a low aside my queen to morrow at eleven at bloomingdale's her blush and smile told him she would be there all left except feuerstein and a youth he had been watching out of the corner of his eyes young dippel son of the rich drug store man feuerstein saw that dippel was on the verge of collapse from too much drink as he still had his eighty five cents he pressed dippel to drink and by paying induced him to add four glasses of beer to his already top heavy burden mus go home said dippel at last rising abruptly feuerstein walked with him taking his arm to steady him let's have one more he said drawing him into a saloon gently pushing him to a seat at a table and ordering whisky after the third large drink dippel became helpless and maudlin and began to overflow with generous sentiments i love you finkelstern ol man he declared tearfully they say you're a dead beat but wha d'i care finkelstern affecting drunkenness shed tears on dippel's shoulder denied that he was a beat and swore that he loved dippel like a brother you're my frien he said i know you'd trust me to any amount dippel took from his trousers pocket a roll of bills several inches thick feuerstein thrilled and his eyes grew eloquent as he noted tens and twenties and at least one fifty slowly and with exaggerated care dippel drew off a ten there y'are ol dead beat he said i'll stake you a ten lots more where that came from soda fountain counter's reg'lar gol mine in taking off the ten he dropped a twenty it fluttered to the floor and the soldier of fortune the scorner of toil and toilers slid his foot over it as swiftly and naturally as a true aristocrat always covers an opportunity to get something somebody else has earned he put the ten in his pocket when dippel's eyes closed he stooped and retrieved the twenty with stealth and skill when the twenty was hidden and the small but typical operation in high finance was complete he shook dippel i say old man he said hadn't you better let me keep your money for you i'm afraid you'll lose it dippel slowly unclosed one eye and gave him a look of glassy cunning he again drew the roll from his pocket and clasping it tightly in his fist waved it under feuerstein's nose as he did it he vented a drunken chuckle soda fountain's gol mine fishenspiel he said thickly no you don't i can"
