"1" "of judgment a penetration into the causes of things unequalled for clearness and precision add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul subduing music august 19 17 yesterday the stranger said to me you may easily perceive captain walton that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me but you have won me to alter my determination you seek for knowledge and wisdom as i once did and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you as mine has been i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you yet when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief perhaps your ridicule but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever varied powers of nature nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power i expressed these feelings in my answer i thank you he replied for your sympathy but it is useless my fate is nearly fulfilled i wait but for one event and then i shall repose in peace i understand your feeling continued he perceiving that i wished to interrupt him but you are mistaken my friend if thus you will allow me to name you nothing can alter my destiny listen to my history and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure this promise drew from me the warmest thanks i have resolved every night when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties to record as nearly as possible in his own words what he has related during the day if i should be engaged i will at least make notes this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure but to me who know him and who hear it from his own lips with what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day even now as i commence my task his full toned voice swells in my ears his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness i see his thin hand raised in animation while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within strange and harrowing must be his story frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it thus chapter 1 i am by birth a genevese and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character i cannot refrain from relating them one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who from a flourishing state fell through numerous mischances into poverty this man whose name was beaufort was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence having paid his debts therefore in the most honourable manner he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne where he lived unknown and in wretchedness my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode overjoyed at this discovery he hastened to the house which was situated in a mean street near the reuss but when he entered misery and despair alone welcomed him beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house the interval was consequently spent in inaction his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness incapable of any exertion his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould and her courage rose to support her in her adversity she procured plain work she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life several months passed in this manner her father grew worse her time was more entirely occupied in attending him her means of subsistence decreased and in the tenth month her father died in her arms leaving her an orphan and a beggar this last blow overcame her and she knelt by beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly when my father entered the chamber he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl who committed herself to his care and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation two years after this event caroline became his wife there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection there was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differing wholly from the doting fondness of age for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of in some degree recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience he strove to shelter her as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit had been shaken by what she had gone through during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders as a restorative for her weakened frame from italy they visited germany and france i their eldest child was born at naples and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles i remained for several years their only child much as they were attached to each other they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me my mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections i was their plaything and their idol and something better their child the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery according as they fulfilled their duties towards me with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience of charity and of self control i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me for a long time i was their only care my mother had much desired to have a daughter but i continued their single offspring when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor this to my mother was more than a duty it was a necessity a passion remembering what she had suffered and how she had been relieved for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the number of half clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest she appeared of a different stock the four others were dark eyed hardy little vagrants this child was thin and very fair her hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head her brow was clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heaven sent and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features the peasant woman perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl eagerly communicated her history she was not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse they were better off then they had not been long married and their eldest child was but just born the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italy one among the schiavi ognor frementi who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country he became the victim of its weakness whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known his property was confiscated his child became an orphan and a beggar she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode fairer than a garden rose among dark leaved brambles when my father returned from milan he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills the apparition was soon explained with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her they were fond of the sweet orphan her presence had seemed a blessing to them but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection they consulted their village priest and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents house my more than sister the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures everyone loved elizabeth the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became while i shared it my pride and my delight on the evening previous to her being brought to my home my mother had said playfully i have a pretty present for my victor tomorrow he shall have it and when on the morrow she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift i with childish seriousness interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as mine mine to protect love and cherish all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin no word no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me my more than sister since till death she was to be mine only chapter 2 we were brought up together there was not quite a year difference in our ages i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute harmony was the soul of our companionship and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition but with all my ardour i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home the sublime shapes of the mountains the changes of the seasons tempest and calm the silence of winter and the life and turbulence of our alpine summers she found ample scope for admiration and delight while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things i delighted in investigating their causes the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine curiosity earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature gladness akin to rapture as they were unfolded to me are among the earliest sensations i can remember on the birth of a second son my junior by seven years my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country we possessed a house in geneva and a campagne on belrive the eastern shore of the lake at the distance of rather more than a league from the city we resided principally in the latter and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few i was indifferent therefore to my school fellows in general but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva he was a boy of singular talent and fancy he loved enterprise hardship and even danger for its own sake he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles of the round table of king arthur and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was and gratitude assisted the development of filial love my temper was sometimes violent and my passions vehement but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn and not to learn all things indiscriminately i confess that neither the structure of languages nor the code of governments nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical or in its highest sense the physical secrets of the world meanwhile clerval occupied himself so to speak with the moral relations of things the busy stage of life the virtues of heroes and the actions of men were his theme and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrine dedicated lamp in our peaceful home her sympathy was ours her smile her soft voice the sweet glance of her celestial eyes were ever there to bless and animate us she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract i might have become sullen in my study rough through the ardour of my nature but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness and clerval could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval yet he might not have been so perfectly humane so thoughtful in his generosity so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self besides in drawing the picture of my early days i also record those events which led by insensible steps to my after tale of misery for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise like a mountain river from ignoble and almost forgotten sources but swelling as it proceeded it became the torrent which in its course has swept away all my hopes and joys natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate i desire therefore in this narration to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science when i was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa i opened it with apathy the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind and bounding with joy i communicated my discovery to my father my father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not waste your time upon this it is sad trash if instead of this remark my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient because the powers of the latter were chimerical while those of the former were real and practical under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination warmed as it was by returning with greater ardour to my former studies it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin but the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents and i continued to read with the greatest avidity when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted appeared even to my boy's apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses the most learned philosopher knew little more he had partially unveiled the face of nature but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery he might dissect anatomize and give names but not to speak of a final cause causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature and rashly and ignorantly i had repined but here were books and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more i took their word for all that they averred and i became their disciple it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of geneva i was to a great degree self taught with regard to my favourite studies my father was not scientific and i was left to struggle with a child's blindness added to a student's thirst for knowledge under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention wealth was an inferior object but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death nor were these my only visions the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors the fulfilment of which i most eagerly sought and if my incantations were always unsuccessful i attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems mingling like an unadept a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning till an accident again changed the current of my ideas when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm it advanced from behind the mountains of jura and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens i remained while the storm lasted watching its progress with curiosity and delight as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house and so soon as the dazzling light vanished the oak had disappeared and nothing remained but a blasted stump when we visited it the next morning we found the tree shattered in a singular manner it was not splintered by the shock but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us and excited by this catastrophe he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism which was at once new and astonishing to me all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus magnus and paracelsus the lords of my imagination but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth i at once gave up my former occupations set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation and entertained the greatest disdain for a would be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations and so worthy of my consideration thus strangely are our souls constructed and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin when i look back it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution happiness with their disregard it was a strong effort of the spirit of good but it was ineffectual destiny was too potent and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction chapter 3 when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country my departure was therefore fixed at an early date but before the day resolved upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occurred an omen as it were of my future misery elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her illness was severe and she was in the greatest danger during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her she had at first yielded to our entreaties but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced she could no longer control her anxiety she attended her sickbed her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper elizabeth was saved but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver on the third day my mother sickened her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself my children she said my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union this expectation will now be the consolation of your father elizabeth my love you must supply my place to my younger children alas i regret that i am taken from you and happy and beloved as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these are not thoughts befitting me i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world she died calmly and her countenance expressed affection even in death i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil the void that presents itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed never more"
