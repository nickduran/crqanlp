"1" "quarters of a mile further on the ball was opened by two small errand boys on whose hands as is usual with the breed time was lying heavily they were engaged in deep converse as we came up and it was only when we were close upon them that they became aware of our presence for a few seconds they stared at us apparently rooted to the spot and as if they could not believe their good fortune then one broke into an explosive bellow of delight while the other ran off squeaking with excitement to find other devils who should share the treasure trove but unlike his infamous predecessor he was not content with seven when he returned it was but as the van of a fast swelling rabble his erstwhile companion who had been backing steadily in front of me ever since he left and had after a hurried consideration of the respective merits of the booth and the box under judy's arm rejected them both in favour of my nose kept his eyes fastened greedily upon that organ with so desperate an air of concentration that i was quite relieved when he tripped over a brick and fell on his back in the road and all this time our following grew the news of our advent had spread like wildfire old men and maidens young men and boys the matron and the maid alike came running altogether lynn hammer was set throbbing with an excitement such as it had not experienced since the baker's assistant was wrongly arrested for petty larceny in 1904 amongst those who walked close about us candid speculation as to the probable venue of the performance was rife while its style length value etc were all frankly discussed many were the questions raised and many the inaccurate explanations accepted as to the reason of our being but though my companion came in for some inevitable discussion i was relieved to find that my panache and a comic peculiarity of gait which i thought it as well from time to time to affect proved usefully diverting when the crowd had begun to assume considerable proportions judy had slipped her arm in mine and an answering pressure to my encouraging squeeze told me that she was trying to buck up as well as she could good little judy it was an ordeal for you but you came through it with flying colours though with a flaming cheek when we reached the triangular piece of grass that lay in front of the village inn i called a halt with such suddenness as to create great confusion in the swarming ranks that followed in our wake but while they sorted themselves i slipped the booth off my shoulders gave one long echoing call upon the reed and striking an attitude made ready to address the expectant villagers after carefully polishing my nose with a silk handkerchief an action which met with instant approval i selected a fat red faced drayman thanked him and said that mine was a bass an assertion which found high favour with the more immediate cronies of the gentleman in question then i got to work after dwelling lightly on the renown in which the village of lynn hammer was held throughout the countryside not to mention a gallant reference to the wit beauty and mirth which was assembled about me i plunged into a facetious resume of recent local events this of course came to me easily enough but the crowd only saw therein the lucky ventures of a talkative stranger and roared with merriment at each happy allusion and so i came to the bananas yes we were for the fete there should we be the livelong afternoon giving free shows and only afterwards soliciting contribution from such as could afford to give in a good cause god save the king then i called for mine host and after ordering ginger beer for judy and old ale for myself slapped silver into his hand and begged as many as would so honour her to drink the lady's health about that there was no difficulty and when i had despatched the original boy who all this while had never wavered in his constancy to my proboscis for a small tin pail i prepared to get my burden once more upon my back but this was not to be four good fellows insisted on constituting themselves booth bearers and the burly drayman gallantly relieved my fair companion of the box of puppets so we came in state to the grounds where the bazaar was to be held the parley with the gatekeeper was of short duration for the workers scented money in our admission and with an eye to the bananas main chance made us quickly welcome on my explaining our intention to put our efforts at their service and any increment that might result into their pockets their expression of gratitude was quite touching the entrance fee deterred some and their daily occupation more of those who had formed our kindly escort from following us into the fete but i believe that most of them contrived to return before six o'clock when i think of all that i said and did on that sunny afternoon i get hot all over i could not go very far wrong during the actual performance but it was afterwards when judy sat smiling in the mouth of the booth and i went forth pail in hand seeking whom i might devour i drew my arm familiarly through that of a reluctant curate and walked him smartly up and down discussing volubly the merits of my nose in tones which suggested that i had no roof to my mouth did a lady protest that she had already contributed i repeated oh madam reproachfully and crescendo till the hush money was paid while in front of those who affected not to see my out stretched hand i stood as if rooted to the spot i borrowed the vicar's wideawake ostensibly for a conjuring trick and wore it assiduously for the rest of the afternoon and on his demurring to such use i explained in the voice of g.p.huntley that it went so well with the nose in short i played the mountebank to a degree that astonished myself but apparently to some purpose for the money came in properly the performances went with a bang and when at the conclusion of the playlet i lifted judy to the rickety shelf so that her head and shoulders were framed in the mouth of the booth it was the signal for a burst of applause on one of these occasions it's not fair that i should take every call she said looking down at my upturned face my dear judy i have my reward what don't i lift you up every time she laughed pleasedly gallant punch you're easily satisfied am i judy am i i said gently taking her hand yes she said snatching it away you are and will be go out and get the money i adjusted my nose thoughtfully daphne was of course in great evidence anxious to run no unnecessary risk i avoided her when possible and when i did find myself in her proximity i at once indulged in some of my more extravagant behaviour where's your brother i heard a worker say brother said daphne bitterly coward and i really thought we should have him this time fled to london before we were up this morning thank you from the amount of food he took with him and the way he took it anyone would have thought he was an escaped convict guilty conscience i suppose one hears a good deal about record flights nowadays but i'd back my miserable brother against any aviator my husband's promised to look in about five if he's back from huntercombe that's something but they're a wretched lot oh here's one of the pierrots i hung the pail on my nose and looked at her as one of the organizers of the fete she said hastily i must thank you nothing doing madam said i in an assumed voice but free list entirely suspended madam and i shook the pail mercilessly a small and grinning crowd had begun to collect so daphne parted up with a forced smile and i went off chuckling to queer the animals race our penultimate performance was over and i was in the midst of my vagaries again when i saw berry unanxious to tempt providence i retired precipitately to the shelter of the booth my companion was sitting disconsolately upon the box on which she stood to work her puppets is it time for the next show she said not for a quarter of an hour i sat down at her feet and removed my mask and nose i'm afraid i persuaded your hand last time judy you touched it let me look it doesn't show let me look after examining the knuckles carefully i turned my attention to the soft little palm obstinacy i said obstinacy is clearly indicated by the dimple situate below saturn and to the right of the watering pot she tried to draw it away but i tightened my hold and proceeded with my investigation a gentle and confiding nature characterized by a penchant for escapade is denoted by the joy wheel at the base of halley's comet and so we come to the life belt this my word this is all right unrivalled for resistance to damp and wear will last three to six times as long as ordinary paint i mean life of extraordinary durability now for the heart line the expert will here descry a curious mixture of further investigation she cut short by so determined an attempt at withdrawal that i let her hand go oughtn't we to be beginning again you're very eager for the last show no i'm not but i want to get it over oh judy she laid her hand on my shoulder no punch no i didn't mean that it's been great fun it's sweet of you to say that it's not don't you think i've liked it i leaned forward dear judy i said very soon it will be over and we shall go our several ways once more and if we don't meet as the months and years go by when other cleverer better men walk by your side and glorious days crowd thick about you throw a spare thought to the old time when you were a strolling player and the poor fool you gave the honour of your company she turned her head away but she did not speak you'll not forget me judy she caught her breath and slipped a hand under her mask for a second then next show punch she cried no of course i shan't you've been very good to me she was on her feet by now and busily arranging the puppets i groaned the next moment she had wound a long call upon the reed which put further converse out of the question the last performance began the first quarrel seemed to lack its wonted bitterness punch appeared halfhearted and judy was simply walking through i glanced at the girl and stroked her pig tail my pig tail wootle i said encouragingly wootle wootle she started at my touch then she seemed to remember and flung herself into her part with abandon when the ghost was on i had a brilliant idea leave the hangman out i whispered and put up judy instead we'll have a reconciliation to finish with and so to punch sobered shaking cowering in the corner with his little plaster hands before his face came his poor wife oh but she did it well gently timidly bravely she laid a trembling hand upon his shoulder and coaxed his hands from before his frightened eyes then backing stood with outstretched appealing little arms a gesture at once so loving and pathetic that punch was fain to thrust his sleeve before his eyes and turn his face in shame to the wall softly went judy to him again touched him and waited and as he turned again to find two little arms stealing about his neck and a poor bare bruised head upon his chest he flung his arms about her with a toot of joy and clasped her in the accepted fashion oh very charming this was greeted with prolonged applause hold it i said hold the picture as she obeyed i slid my left arm about her ready to lift her up suddenly punch became limp and lifeless in his wife's embrace and with my freed right hand i slipped her mask over her forehead smiled into her eyes and kissed them i promised not to ask again punch so for a moment we two let the world wag then the whole booth fell heavily over mouth uppermost and we within it it was the final of the animal race that was responsible for our overthrow the black pig blind with jealous rage and mortification at being beaten on the tape by a cochin china had borne violently down upon the booth and upset it with wicked grunts of satisfaction hurt dear said i no as she slipped her mask into place berry put his head in at the mouth of the booth maskless noseless i looked at him slowly his astonished features relaxed in a grin so he said softly i might have known chapter ii clothes and the man this said berry is all right by which i mean we assured him we knew what he meant and that no explanation was necessary all right he said at last there i've said it again now you're quite sure you do know what i mean because if you've the least hesitation will you be quiet said daphne alright it was a beautiful august morning after a roaring season in town we had all five berry daphne jonah jill and myself girded our jaded loins packed crawled into the car and rolled down to cornwall there to build up the wasted tissues go to bed at ten and forget that there were such things as theatres and ballrooms we took a couple of days coming down by road and our run was not without incident i wish cyclists would not hang on behind in kingston a monger's boy with some fish that were patently feeling the heat took hold of the cape hood i spoke with him after a little the use of this hood i said for heavy and bulky packages involves risk of injury to passengers and is prohibited didn't you know that he regarded me with a seraphic smile nearly lost his life by getting into a tram line and said i ought to know better than to talk to the man at the wheel friend said i i perceive you are a humorist lo here in this car are already three humorists under these unfortunate circumstances i have no alternative but to ask you to withdraw it was just then that the near hind tyre burst exactly under him we gave him half a sovereign towards buying a new bicycle but i believe he will always think we did it on purpose it had been arranged that we should spend the night at salisbury and push on to cornwall on the following day we made the cathedral city soon after five and slipped out to see stonehenge there were a few other people there and one or two of them turned to watch our arrival berry left the car and went straight to the nearest a fat tradesman wearing a new imitation panama and a huge calabash can you tell me if this is stoke poges we heard him say the rest of us alighted and walked hurriedly away in the opposite direction clearly my brother in law was in a certain mood and no fit companion for the sensitive memories of the unutterable torment to which on like occasions we had been mercilessly subjected by reason of berry's most shameless behaviour among strangers rose up before us the fact that he called after us caused daphne to break into a run our luck was out when we had completed the circle of the cromlechs we came suddenly upon him more to our dismay than surprise he had become the centre of a little knot of excursionists who were listening to him eagerly as we appeared ah he said to the interested company here is my aunt she'll tell you aunt daphne wasn't it here that father lost the string bag wretched fool said daphne under her breath turning hurriedly in the direction of the car berry watched her retreat and turned to his listeners with a sigh i'm afraid i've gone and upset her now he said i oughtn't to have reminded her of the untoward incident it was the only string bag they had and it was an awful blow to her it upset him too terribly never the same man again in fact from that day he began to go wrong criminally i mean the little group grew closer to him than ever like a fool i stayed to hear more yes berry went on in less than a month he was up at the old bailey under the merchandise marks act for selling gruyere cheese with too big holes in it five years his sentence was let's see he ought to be coming out in about oh about when does father come out cousin albert the excursionists gazed greedily at me the felon's son i approached berry and laid a hand upon his arm then i turned to the little group this fellow i said has got us into trouble before those of you who have motor cars will understand me when i refer to the great difficulty of securing a really trustworthy chauffeur now this man is honest and a most careful driver but when he is so to speak off duty he is so unfortunate as to suffer from delusions usually connected with crime and the administration of the criminal law while we were having lunch at whitchurch only this afternoon he went off to the police station and tried to give himself up for the hounslow murder didn't you yes sir faltered berry and all the time i went on i'm not at all satisfied myself that he did murder the woman although things certainly looked rather black i did said berry fiercely the crowd of excursionists recoiled and a small boy in a green flannel blazer burst into tears any way i said there isn't anything like enough evidence against you so we won't argue it now then we want to be going come along half a shake sir said berry feeling in his pockets you know that knife the company began nervously to disperse some exhorted one another to observe some feature of the cromlechs which was only visible from some point of vantage on the side other to that on which we stood others agreed that they had no idea that it was so late and the fat tradesman gave a forced shiver and announced that he must have left his coat behind that big one i'll get it for you sir said berry opening his knife i was forced to admit that stonehenge looked far more impressive when apparently deserted than with one or two tourists however genial and guileless in a high holiday humour in the foreground at the same time as we walked back to the car i felt that i owed it to myself to lodge a grave protest against the indecent and involving methods my brother in law had seen fit to employ after all i concluded the fellow's your brother and even if his panama wasn't a real one that's no reason why he should be made to do the hundred in about twelve seconds he wasn't in strict training either you could see that besides why rope me in for yourself if you must play the comic idiot he wasn't in the picture said berry none of them were that kid's blazer absolutely killed the grass for miles around didn't you see how brown it had gone that he added coolly is the worst of having an artistic eye one must pay for these things after spending the night at salisbury we pushed on to the cornish coast it was not until we were within three miles of our village that we lost the way when we found it again we were seven miles off that is the worst of a car however stern is a place where the coast line is a great glory the cliffs rise there tall dark majestic grave too especially grave when the sky is grey they frown always and even the warm rays of the setting sun but serve to light their grand solemnity very different is the changing sea at their foot at times it will ripple all day agog with smiling anon provoked by an idle breeze's banter you shall see it black with rage in the morning maybe it will sleep placidly enough in the sunshine but at eventide the wind has ruffled its temper so that it mutters and heaves with anger breathing forth threatenings yet the next dawn finds it alive with mischievous merriment and splitting its sides with laughter to think how it has duped you the night before the great grave cliffs and the shifting sea and beyond woodland and pastures and deep meadows where the cows low in the evenings while the elms tower above them their leaves unshaken by the wind it is not difficult to grow fond of stern and now we were sitting on the cliffs in the heat of the morning sun half a mile from the village and another from the places where it was best to bathe after a while aren't you glad i made you come here said daphne triumphantly i sat up and stared at her sorrowfully well she said defiantly you have taken my breath away i said kindly return it and i will deal with you and your interrogatories i suppose you're going to say it was you it was i did i have but for me you would not you are i took the rooms i drove the car nearly the whole way down i got you all here i sent the luggage on in advance with the result that it got here two days after we did and i had to wear the same tie three days running and go down to bathe in patent leather boots thanks very much said berry beyond saying that i was not responsible for the crass and purblind idiocy of railway officials i ignored this expression of ingratitude and continued to deal with daphne you know i said there are times when i tremble for you only yesterday just before dinner i trembled for you like anything it's the heat said my target as if explaining something and my reward is covert reflections upon my sanity need i say more no said everybody thank you ladies and gentlemen for your kind attention the next performance will be at four o'clock this afternoon underneath the promenade pier i relapsed into comfortable silence and sank back into the bracken my sister got up from the clump of heather in which she was ensconced crossed to where i was took my pipe out of my mouth and kissed me sorry old boy she said you're not such a bad sort really dear love said i what have you left behind my bathing dress darling in spite of the fact that i returned to the hotel and got it they were positively rude about the bathing cove i selected bathe there sneered berry as we looked down upon it all smiling in the sun from the top of the cliffs thanks awfully i simply love the flints don't you jill personally my doctor bled me just before i came away but don't let me stop you others lead on brother lead the way to the shambles of course daphne took up the running my dear boy look at the seaweed on the rocks why we should slip and break our legs before we'd taken two steps that's all right said berry we have between us three shirts torn into strips they will make excellent bandages while for a splint the cove i said is ideal its sand is a field of lilies its sea perfumed its boulders sweet smelling cushions of course said berry why do you tarry forward friends all this way to the drug department to the lions o christians for myself if i start at once i shall be able to get back with the coastguard's ambulance before you've been lying there more than an hour or two and i can wire for your relatives at the same time anybody would think the place was an oubliette said i as a matter of fact the path down is an easy one there are no flints and there is a singular paucity of seaweed of any description on the other hand the sun is hot the sand is soft and i have already selected that rock in the seclusion of whose shade i shall prepare myself for the waves sorry it's too dangerous for you i'll write about some bathing machines to night do you like them with red or green doors without waiting for their reply which would probably have been of the caustic and provocative type i turned down the path i had not trodden for some three years at one of the bends i looked up and saw them moving north along the coast line i had the cove to myself and was soon in my bathing dress the water was magnificent i swam out about forty yards and turned just in time to see berry co disappear in the distance apparently descending into a neighbouring cove after a rest on a rock i set out to swim round and join them it was further than i thought and i was glad to wade out of the water and lie down on the sand in the sun no sign of the others by the way but hereabouts the coast was very ragged it must have been the next cove they were making for quite still please said somebody and the next moment a camera clicked you might have given me time to moisten the lips said i i doubt if it would have done any good thanks very much by the way i suppose you're the daily glass how did you find me out rumour travels apace sir and i had been congratulating myself on eluding the press since breakfast well well only this morning dry up i apostrophized the sea i don't want to have to report the chap i said but if the camera clicked again i'm not sure this isn't an assault i said that it is a trespass i know who are your solicitors and may i take it that they will accept service here i rolled over and leaned on my elbow you do look fit just move your heel out of that pool there's an anemone going to mistake it for a piece of alabaster that's right oh but mermaid do tell me how you keep your hair so nice when you're bathing like it i love it i simply don't put my head under a most dangerous practice believe me it's worth the risk i belive it is she was sitting on a low slab of rock clad in a bathing costume of plain dark blue and fashioned just like my own her dark hair was parted in the middle and divided at the back into two long thick plaits which were turned up and hair pinned round the top of her head her features were beautiful and her eyes big and dark as her hair her figure was slim and graceful and her arms and hands and feet were very shapely one brown knee was crossed over the other and her left hand held the camera i do have luck you know i said what luck well honestly it's a great pleasure to meet you like this when i might have spent all day talking with my silly crowd and never have known of your existence don't be afraid i merely mean that i am enjoying your society and i'm glad i came round the corner i'm not in love with you and i don't want never to leave your side again but oh you understand mermaid don't you you look as if you could if you liked my companion stared out to sea with a faint smile on her lips i flung out an arm with a gesture of despair oh if you knew how sick i am of the girl about town the girl of to day who won't be natural herself and won't let you be natural either who is always bored and who has no use for anyone who isn't forever making mock love to her or why on earth can't a man tell a woman he likes her company and mean it without the woman thinking he wants to kiss her or marry her or something i broke off and looked at her go on she said you interest me oh heavens i said falteringly why have you got such big eyes at this to my discomfiture she broke into peals of merriment before you looked at me like that i was really enjoying your company without"
