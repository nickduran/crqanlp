eyes art thou sure that all this is shere khan's doing by the broken lock that freed me i am sure little brother then by the bull that bought me i will pay shere khan full tale for this and it may be a little over said mowgli and he bounded away that is a man that is all a man said bagheera to himself lying down again oh shere khan never was a blacker hunting than that frog hunt of thine ten years ago mowgli was far and far through the forest running hard and his heart was hot in him he came to the cave as the evening mist rose and drew breath and looked down the valley the cubs were out but mother wolf at the back of the cave knew by his breathing that something was troubling her frog what is it son she said some bat's chatter of shere khan he called back i hunt among the plowed fields tonight and he plunged downward through the bushes to the stream at the bottom of the valley there he checked for he heard the yell of the pack hunting heard the bellow of a hunted sambhur and the snort as the buck turned at bay then there were wicked bitter howls from the young wolves akela akela let the lone wolf show his strength room for the leader of the pack spring akela the lone wolf must have sprung and missed his hold for mowgli heard the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the sambhur knocked him over with his forefoot he did not wait for anything more but dashed on and the yells grew fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers lived bagheera spoke truth he panted as he nestled down in some cattle fodder by the window of a hut to morrow is one day both for akela and for me then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on the hearth he saw the husbandman's wife get up and feed it in the night with black lumps and when the morning came and the mists were all white and cold he saw the man's child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside with earth fill it with lumps of red hot charcoal put it under his blanket and go out to tend the cows in the byre is that all said mowgli if a cub can do it there is nothing to fear so he strode round the corner and met the boy took the pot from his hand and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear they are very like me said mowgli blowing into the pot as he had seen the woman do this thing will die if i do not give it things to eat and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff halfway up the hill he met bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his coat akela has missed said the panther they would have killed him last night but they needed thee also they were looking for thee on the hill i was among the plowed lands i am ready see mowgli held up the fire pot good now i have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff and presently the red flower blossomed at the end of it art thou not afraid no why should i fear i remember now if it is not a dream how before i was a wolf i lay beside the red flower and it was warm and pleasant all that day mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping dry branches into it to see how they looked he found a branch that satisfied him and in the evening when tabaqui came to the cave and told him rudely enough that he was wanted at the council rock he laughed till tabaqui ran away then mowgli went to the council still laughing akela the lone wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the leadership of the pack was open and shere khan with his following of scrap fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered bagheera lay close to mowgli and the fire pot was between mowgli's knees when they were all gathered together shere khan began to speak a thing he would never have dared to do when akela was in his prime he has no right whispered bagheera say so he is a dog's son he will be frightened mowgli sprang to his feet free people he cried does shere khan lead the pack what has a tiger to do with our leadership seeing that the leadership is yet open and being asked to speak shere khan began by whom said mowgli are we all jackals to fawn on this cattle butcher the leadership of the pack is with the pack alone there were yells of silence thou man's cub let him speak he has kept our law and at last the seniors of the pack thundered let the dead wolf speak when a leader of the pack has missed his kill he is called the dead wolf as long as he lives which is not long akela raised his old head wearily free people and ye too jackals of shere khan for twelve seasons i have led ye to and from the kill and in all that time not one has been trapped or maimed now i have missed my kill ye know how that plot was made ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my weakness known it was cleverly done your right is to kill me here on the council rock now therefore i ask who comes to make an end of the lone wolf for it is my right by the law of the jungle that ye come one by one there was a long hush for no single wolf cared to fight akela to the death then shere khan roared bah what have we to do with this toothless fool he is doomed to die it is the man cub who has lived too long free people he was my meat from the first give him to me i am weary of this man wolf folly he has troubled the jungle for ten seasons give me the man cub or i will hunt here always and not give you one bone he is a man a man's child and from the marrow of my bones i hate him then more than half the pack yelled a man a man what has a man to do with us let him go to his own place and turn all the people of the villages against us clamored shere khan no give him to me he is a man and none of us can look him between the eyes akela lifted his head again and said he has eaten our food he has slept with us he has driven game for us he has broken no word of the law of the jungle also i paid for him with a bull when he was accepted the worth of a bull is little but bagheera's honor is something that he will perhaps fight for said bagheera in his gentlest voice a bull paid ten years ago the pack snarled what do we care for bones ten years old or for a pledge said bagheera his white teeth bared under his lip well are ye called the free people no man's cub can run with the people of the jungle howled shere khan give him to me he is our brother in all but blood akela went on and ye would kill him here in truth i have lived too long some of ye are eaters of cattle and of others i have heard that under shere khan's teaching ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager's doorstep therefore i know ye to be cowards and it is to cowards i speak it is certain that i must die and my life is of no worth or i would offer that in the man cub's place but for the sake of the honor of the pack a little matter that by being without a leader ye have forgotten i promise that if ye let the man cub go to his own place i will not when my time comes to die bare one tooth against ye i will die without fighting that will at least save the pack three lives more i cannot do but if ye will i can save ye the shame that comes of killing a brother against whom there is no fault a brother spoken for and bought into the pack according to the law of the jungle he is a man a man a man snarled the pack and most of the wolves began to gather round shere khan whose tail was beginning to switch now the business is in thy hands said bagheera to mowgli we can do no more except fight mowgli stood upright the fire pot in his hands then he stretched out his arms and yawned in the face of the council but he was furious with rage and sorrow for wolflike the wolves had never told him how they hated him listen you he cried there is no need for this dog's jabber ye have told me so often tonight that i am a man and indeed i would have been a wolf with you to my life's end that i feel your words are true so i do not call ye my brothers any more but sag dogs as a man should what ye will do and what ye will not do is not yours to say that matter is with me and that we may see the matter more plainly i the man have brought here a little of the red flower which ye dogs fear he flung the fire pot on the ground and some of the red coals lit a tuft of dried moss that flared up as all the council drew back in terror before the leaping flames mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and crackled and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves thou art the master said bagheera in an undertone save akela from the death he was ever thy friend akela the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life gave one piteous look at mowgli as the boy stood all naked his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that made the shadows jump and quiver good said mowgli staring round slowly i see that ye are dogs i go from you to my own people if they be my own people the jungle is shut to me and i must forget your talk and your companionship but i will be more merciful than ye are because i was all but your brother in blood i promise that when i am a man among men i will not betray ye to men as ye have betrayed me he kicked the fire with his foot and the sparks flew up there shall be no war between any of us in the pack but here is a debt to pay before i go he strode forward to where shere khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames and caught him by the tuft on his chin bagheera followed in case of accidents up dog mowgli cried up when a man speaks or i will set that coat ablaze shere khan's ears lay flat back on his head and he shut his eyes for the blazing branch was very near this cattle killer said he would kill me in the council because he had not killed me when i was a cub thus and thus then do we beat dogs when we are men stir a whisker lungri and i ram the red flower down thy gullet he beat shere khan over the head with the branch and the tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear pah singed jungle cat go now but remember when next i come to the council rock as a man should come it will be with shere khan's hide on my head for the rest akela goes free to live as he pleases ye will not kill him because that is not my will nor do i think that ye will sit here any longer lolling out your tongues as though ye were somebodies instead of dogs whom i drive out thus go the fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch and mowgli struck right and left round the circle and the wolves ran howling with the sparks burning their fur at last there were only akela bagheera and perhaps ten wolves that had taken mowgli's part then something began to hurt mowgli inside him as he had never been hurt in his life before and he caught his breath and sobbed and the tears ran down his face what is it what is it he said i do not wish to leave the jungle and i do not know what this is am i dying bagheera no little brother that is only tears such as men use said bagheera now i know thou art a man and a man's cub no longer the jungle is shut indeed to thee henceforward let them fall mowgli they are only tears so mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break and he had never cried in all his life before now he said i will go to men but first i must say farewell to my mother and he went to the cave where she lived with father wolf and he cried on her coat while the four cubs howled miserably ye will not forget me said mowgli never while we can follow a trail said the cubs come to the foot of the hill when thou art a man and we will talk to thee and we will come into the croplands to play with thee by night come soon said father wolf oh wise little frog come again soon for we be old thy mother and i come soon said mother wolf little naked son of mine for listen child of man i loved thee more than ever i loved my cubs i will surely come said mowgli and when i come it will be to lay out shere khan's hide upon the council rock do not forget me tell them in the jungle never to forget me the dawn was beginning to break when mowgli went down the hillside alone to meet those mysterious things that are called men hunting song of the seeonee pack as the dawn was breaking the sambhur belled once twice and again and a doe leaped up and a doe leaped up from the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup this i scouting alone beheld once twice and again as the dawn was breaking the sambhur belled once twice and again and a wolf stole back and a wolf stole back to carry the word to the waiting pack and we sought and we found and we bayed on his track once twice and again as the dawn was breaking the wolf pack yelled once twice and again feet in the jungle that leave no mark eyes that can see in the dark the dark tongue give tongue to it hark o hark once twice and again kaa's hunting his spots are the joy of the leopard his horns are the buffalo's pride be clean for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide if ye find that the bullock can toss you or the heavy browed sambhur can gore ye need not stop work to inform us we knew it ten seasons before oppress not the cubs of the stranger but hail them as sister and brother for though they are little and fubsy it may be the bear is their mother there is none like to me says the cub in the pride of his earliest kill but the jungle is large and the cub he is small let him think and be still maxims of baloo all that is told here happened some time before mowgli was turned out of the seeonee wolf pack or revenged himself on shere khan the tiger it was in the days when baloo was teaching him the law of the jungle the big serious old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil for the young wolves will only learn as much of the law of the jungle as applies to their own pack and tribe and run away as soon as they can repeat the hunting verse feet that make no noise eyes that can see in the dark ears that can hear the winds in their lairs and sharp white teeth all these things are the marks of our brothers except tabaqui the jackal and the hyaena whom we hate but mowgli as a man cub had to learn a great deal more than this sometimes bagheera the black panther would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting on and would purr with his head against a tree while mowgli recited the day's lesson to baloo the boy could climb almost as well as he could swim and swim almost as well as he could run so baloo the teacher of the law taught him the wood and water laws how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground what to say to mang the bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday and how to warn the water snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them none of the jungle people like being disturbed and all are very ready to fly at an intruder then too mowgli was taught the strangers hunting call which must be repeated aloud till it is answered whenever one of the jungle people hunts outside his own grounds it means translated give me leave to hunt here because i am hungry and the answer is hunt then for food but not for pleasure all this will show you how much mowgli had to learn by heart and he grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times but as baloo said to bagheera one day when mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a temper a man's cub is a man's cub and he must learn all the law of the jungle but think how small he is said the black panther who would have spoiled mowgli if he had had his own way how can his little head carry all thy long talk is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed no that is why i teach him these things and that is why i hit him very softly when he forgets softly what dost thou know of softness old iron feet bagheera grunted his face is all bruised today by thy softness ugh better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than that he should come to harm through ignorance baloo answered very earnestly i am now teaching him the master words of the jungle that shall protect him with the birds and the snake people and all that hunt on four feet except his own pack he can now claim protection if he will only remember the words from all in the jungle is not that worth a little beating well look to it then that thou dost not kill the man cub he is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon but what are those master words i am more likely to give help than to ask it bagheera stretched out one paw and admired the steel blue ripping chisel talons at the end of it still i should like to know i will call mowgli and he shall say them if he will come little brother my head is ringing like a bee tree said a sullen little voice over their heads and mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant adding as he reached the ground i come for bagheera and not for thee fat old baloo that is all one to me said baloo though he was hurt and grieved tell bagheera then the master words of the jungle that i have taught thee this day master words for which people said mowgli delighted to show off the jungle has many tongues i know them all a little thou knowest but not much see o bagheera they never thank their teacher not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank old baloo for his teachings say the word for the hunting people then great scholar we be of one blood ye and i said mowgli giving the words the bear accent which all the hunting people use good now for the birds mowgli repeated with the kite's whistle at the end of the sentence now for the snake people said bagheera the answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss and mowgli kicked up his feet behind clapped his hands together to applaud himself and jumped on to bagheera's back where he sat sideways drumming with his heels on the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at baloo there there that was worth a little bruise said the brown bear tenderly some day thou wilt remember me then he turned aside to tell bagheera how he had begged the master words from hathi the wild elephant who knows all about these things and how hathi had taken mowgli down to a pool to get the snake word from a water snake because baloo could not pronounce it and how mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents in the jungle because neither snake bird nor beast would hurt him no one then is to be feared baloo wound up patting his big furry stomach with pride except his own tribe said bagheera under his breath and then aloud to mowgli have a care for my ribs little brother what is all this dancing up and down mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at bagheera's shoulder fur and kicking hard when the two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his voice and so i shall have a tribe of my own and lead them through the branches all day long what is this new folly little dreamer of dreams said bagheera yes and throw branches and dirt at old baloo mowgli went on they have promised me this ah whoof baloo's big paw scooped mowgli off bagheera's back and as the boy lay between the big fore paws he could see the bear was angry mowgli said baloo thou hast been talking with the bandar log the monkey people mowgli looked at bagheera to see if the panther was angry too and bagheera's eyes were as hard as jade stones thou hast been with the monkey people the gray apes the people without a law the eaters of everything that is great shame when baloo hurt my head said mowgli he was still on his back i went away and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on me no one else cared he snuffled a little the pity of the monkey people baloo snorted the stillness of the mountain stream the cool of the summer sun and then man cub and then and then they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat and they they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said i was their blood brother except that i had no tail and should be their leader some day they have no leader said bagheera they lie they have always lied they were very kind and bade me come again why have i never been taken among the monkey people they stand on their feet as i do they do not hit me with their hard paws they play all day let me get up bad baloo let me up i will play with them again listen man cub said the bear and his voice rumbled like thunder on a hot night i have taught thee all the law of the jungle for all the peoples of the jungle except the monkey folk who live in the trees they have no law they are outcasts they have no speech of their own but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen and peep and wait up above in the branches their way is not our way they are without leaders they have no remembrance they boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the jungle but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten we of the jungle have no dealings with them we do not drink where the monkeys drink we do not go where the monkeys go we do not hunt where they hunt we do not die where they die hast thou ever heard me speak of the bandar log till today no said mowgli in a whisper for the forest was very still now baloo had finished the jungle people put them out of their mouths and out of their minds they are very many evil dirty shameless and they desire if they have any fixed desire to be noticed by the jungle people but we do not notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads he had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down through the branches and they could hear coughings and howlings and angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches the monkey people are forbidden said baloo forbidden to the jungle people remember forbidden said bagheera but i still think baloo should have warned thee against them i i how was i to guess he would play with such dirt the monkey people faugh a fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away taking mowgli with them what baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly true they belonged to the tree tops and as beasts very seldom look up there was no occasion for the monkeys and the jungle people to cross each other's path but whenever they found a sick wolf or a wounded tiger or bear the monkeys would torment him and would throw sticks and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed then they would howl and shriek senseless songs and invite the jungle people to climb up their trees and fight them or would start furious battles over nothing among themselves and leave the dead monkeys where the jungle people could see them they were always just going to have a leader and laws and customs of their own but they never did because their memories would not hold over from day to day and so they compromised things by making up a saying what the bandar log think now the jungle will think later and that comforted them a great deal none of the beasts could reach them but on the other hand none of the beasts would notice them and that was why they were so pleased when mowgli came to play with them and they heard how angry baloo was they never meant to do any more the bandar log never mean anything at all but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea and he told all the others that mowgli would be a useful person to keep in the tribe because he could weave sticks together for protection from the wind so if they caught him they could make him teach them of course mowgli as a woodcutter's child inherited all sorts of instincts and used to make little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came to do it the monkey people watching in the trees considered his play most wonderful this time they said they were really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the jungle so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them therefore they followed baloo and bagheera and mowgli through the jungle very quietly till it was time for the midday nap and mowgli who was very much ashamed of himself slept between the panther and the bear resolving to have no more to do with the monkey people the next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and arms hard strong little hands and then a swash of branches in his face and then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as baloo woke the jungle with his deep cries and bagheera bounded up the trunk with every tooth bared the bandar log howled with triumph and scuffled away to the upper branches where bagheera"
