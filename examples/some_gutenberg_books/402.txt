"1" "of his costume this permitted a temporary relief but increased his horror of the moment when in pursuance of the action of the pageant the sheltering garment must be cast aside some of the other child knights were also keeping their mantles close about them a few of the envied opulent swung brilliant fabrics from their shoulders airily showing off hired splendours from a professional costumer's stock while one or two were insulting examples of parental indulgence particularly little maurice levy the child sir galahad this shrinking person went clamorously about making it known everywhere that the best tailor in town had been dazzled by a great sum into constructing his costume it consisted of blue velvet knickerbockers a white satin waistcoat and a beautifully cut little swallow tailed coat with pearl buttons the medieval and artistic triumph was completed by a mantle of yellow velvet and little white boots sporting gold tassels all this radiance paused in a brilliant career and addressed the child sir lancelot gathering an immediately formed semicircular audience of little girls woman was ever the trailer of magnificence what you got on inquired mr levy after dispensing information what you got on under that ole golf cape penrod looked upon him coldly at other times his questioner would have approached him with deference even with apprehension but to day the child sir galahad was somewhat intoxicated with the power of his own beauty what you got on he repeated oh nothin said penrod with an indifference assumed at great cost to his nervous system the elate maurice was inspired to set up as a wit then you're nakid he shouted exultantly penrod schofield says he hasn't got nothin on under that ole golf cape he's nakid he's nakid the indelicate little girls giggled delightedly and a javelin pierced the inwards of penrod when he saw that the child elaine amber curled and beautiful marjorie jones lifted golden laughter to the horrid jest other boys and girls came flocking to the uproar he's nakid he's nakid shrieked the child sir galahad penrod schofield's nakid he's na a a kid hush hush said mrs lora rewbush pushing her way into the group remember we are all little knights and ladies to day little knights and ladies of the table round would not make so much noise now children we must begin to take our places on the stage is everybody here penrod made his escape under cover of this diversion he slid behind mrs lora rewbush and being near a door opened it unnoticed and went out quickly closing it behind him he found himself in a narrow and vacant hallway which led to a door marked janitor's room burning with outrage heart sick at the sweet cold blooded laughter of marjorie jones penrod rested his elbows upon a window sill and speculated upon the effects of a leap from the second story one of the reasons he gave it up was his desire to live on maurice levy's account already he was forming educational plans for the child sir galahad a stout man in blue overalls passed through the hallway muttering to himself petulantly i reckon they'll find that hall hot enough now he said conveying to penrod an impression that some too feminine women had sent him upon an unreasonable errand to the furnace he went into the janitor's room and emerging a moment later minus the overalls passed penrod again with a bass rumble dern em it seemed he said and made a gloomy exit by the door at the upper end of the hallway the conglomerate and delicate rustle of a large mannerly audience was heard as the janitor opened and closed the door and stage fright seized the boy the orchestra began an overture and at that penrod trembling violently tiptoed down the hall into the janitor's room it was a cul de sac there was no outlet save by the way he had come despairingly he doffed his mantle and looked down upon himself for a last sickening assurance that the stockings were as obviously and disgracefully margaret's as they had seemed in the mirror at home for a moment he was encouraged perhaps he was no worse than some of the other boys then he noticed that a safety pin had opened one of those connecting the stockings with his trunks he sat down to fasten it and his eye fell for the first time with particular attention upon the trunks until this instant he had been preoccupied with the stockings slowly recognition dawned in his eyes the schofields house stood on a corner at the intersection of two main travelled streets the fence was low and the publicity obtained by the washable portion of the family apparel on mondays had often been painful to penrod for boys have a peculiar sensitiveness in these matters a plain matter of fact washerwoman employed by mrs schofield never left anything to the imagination of the passer by and of all her calm display the scarlet flaunting of his father's winter wear had most abashed penrod one day marjorie jones all gold and starch had passed when the dreadful things were on the line penrod had hidden himself shuddering the whole town he was convinced knew these garments intimately and derisively and now as he sat in the janitor's chair the horrible and paralyzing recognition came he had not an instant's doubt that every fellow actor as well as every soul in the audience would recognize what his mother and sister had put upon him for as the awful truth became plain to himself it seemed blazoned to the world and far far louder than the stockings the trunks did fairly bellow the grisly secret whose they were and what they were most people have suffered in a dream the experience of finding themselves very inadequately clad in the midst of a crowd of well dressed people and such dreamers sensations are comparable to penrod's though faintly because penrod was awake and in much too full possession of the most active capacities for anguish a human male whose dress has been damaged or reveals some vital lack suffers from a hideous and shameful loneliness which makes every second absolutely unbearable until he is again as others of his sex and species and there is no act or sin whatever too desperate for him in his struggle to attain that condition also there is absolutely no embarrassment possible to a woman which is comparable to that of a man under corresponding circumstances and in this a boy is a man gazing upon the ghastly trunks the stricken penrod felt that he was a degree worse then nude and a great horror of himself filled his soul penrod schofield the door into the hallway opened and a voice demanded him he could not be seen from the hallway but the hue and the cry was up and he knew he must be taken it was only a question of seconds he huddled in his chair penrod schofield cried mrs lora rewbush angrily the distracted boy rose and as he did so a long pin sank deep into his back he extracted it frenziedly which brought to his ears a protracted and sonorous ripping too easily located by a final gesture of horror penrod schofield mrs lora rewbush had come out into the hallway and now in this extremity when all seemed lost indeed particularly including honour the dilating eye of the outlaw fell upon the blue overalls which the janitor had left hanging upon a peg inspiration and action were almost simultaneous chapter v the pageant of the table round penrod mrs lora rewbush stood in the doorway indignantly gazing upon a child sir lancelot mantled to the heels do you know that you have kept an audience of five hundred people waiting for ten minutes she also detained the five hundred while she spake further well said penrod contentedly as he followed her toward the buzzing stage i was just sitting there thinking two minutes later the curtain rose on a medieval castle hall richly done in the new stage craft made in germany and consisting of pink and blue cheesecloth the child king arthur and the child queen guinevere were disclosed upon thrones with the child elaine and many other celebrities in attendance while about fifteen child knights were seated at a dining room table round which was covered with a large oriental rug and displayed for the knights refreshment a banquet service of silver loving cups and trophies borrowed from the country club and some local automobile manufacturers in addition to this splendour potted plants and palms have seldom been more lavishly used in any castle on the stage or off the footlights were aided by a spot light from the rear of the hall and the children were revealed in a blaze of glory a hushed multitudinous o oh of admiration came from the decorous and delighted audience then the children sang feebly chuldrun of the tabul round lit tul knights and ladies we let our voy siz all resound faith and hope and charitee the child king arthur rose extended his sceptre with the decisive gesture of a semaphore and spake each littul knight and lady born has noble deeds to perform in thee child world of shivullree no matter how small his share may be let each advance and tell in turn what claim has each to knighthood earn the child sir mordred the villain of this piece rose in his place at the table round and piped the only lines ever written by mrs lora rewbush which penrod schofield could have pronounced without loathing georgie bassett a really angelic boy had been selected for the role of mordred his perfect conduct had earned for him the sardonic sobriquet the little gentleman among his boy acquaintances naturally he had no friends hence the other boys supposed that he had been selected for the wicked mordred as a reward of virtue he declaimed serenely i hight sir mordred the child and i teach lessons of selfishest evil and reach out into darkness thoughtless unkind and ruthless is mordred and unrefined the child mordred was properly rebuked and denied the accolade though like the others he seemed to have assumed the title already he made a plotter's exit whereupon maurice levy rose bowed announced that he highted the child sir galahad and continued with perfect sang froid i am the purest of the pure i have but kindest thoughts each day i give my riches to the poor and follow in the master's way this elicited tokens of approval from the child king arthur and he bade maurice stand forth and come near the throne a command obeyed with the easy grace of conscious merit it was penrod's turn he stepped back from his chair the table between him and the audience and began in a high breathless monotone i hight sir lancelot du lake the child gentul hearted meek and mild what though i'm but a littul child gentul heartud meek and mild i do my share though but though but penrod paused and gulped the voice of mrs lora rewbush was heard from the wings prompting irritably and the child sir lancelot repeated i do my share though but though but a tot i pray you knight sir lancelot this also met the royal favour and penrod was bidden to join sir galahad at the throne as he crossed the stage mrs schofield whispered to margaret that boy he's unpinned his mantle and fixed it to cover his whole costume after we worked so hard to make it becoming never mind he'll have to take the cape off in a minute returned margaret she leaned forward suddenly narrowing her eyes to see better what is that thing hanging about his left ankle she whispered uneasily how queer he must have got tangled in something where asked mrs schofield in alarm his left foot it makes him stumble don't you see it looks it looks like an elephant's foot the child sir lancelot and the child sir galahad clasped hands before their child king penrod was conscious of a great uplift in a moment he would have to throw aside his mantle but even so he was protected and sheltered in the human garment of a man his stage fright had passed for the audience was but an indistinguishable blur of darkness beyond the dazzling lights his most repulsive speech that in which he proclaimed himself a tot was over and done with and now at last the small moist hand of the child sir galahad lay within his own craftily his brown fingers stole from maurice's palm to the wrist the two boys declaimed in concert we are two chuldrun of the tabul round strewing kindness all a round with love and good deeds striving ever for the best may our littul efforts e'er be blest two littul hearts we offer see united in love faith hope and char ow the conclusion of the duet was marred the child sir galahad suddenly stiffened and uttering an irrepressible shriek of anguish gave a brief exhibition of the contortionist's art he's twistin my wrist dern you leggo the voice of mrs lora rewbush was again heard from the wings it sounded bloodthirsty penrod released his victim and the child king arthur somewhat disconcerted extended his sceptre and with the assistance of the enraged prompter said sweet child friends of the tabul round in brotherly love and kindness abound sir lancelot you have spoken well sir galahad too as clear as bell so now pray doff your mantles gay you shall be knighted this very day and penrod doffed his mantle simultaneously a thick and vasty gasp came from the audience as from five hundred bathers in a wholly unexpected surf this gasp was punctuated irregularly over the auditorium by imperfectly subdued screams both of dismay and incredulous joy and by two dismal shrieks altogether it was an extraordinary sound a sound never to be forgotten by any one who heard it it was almost as unforgettable as the sight which caused it the word sight being here used in its vernacular sense for penrod standing unmantled and revealed in all the medieval and artistic glory of the janitor's blue overalls falls within its meaning the janitor was a heavy man and his overalls upon penrod were merely oceanic the boy was at once swaddled and lost within their blue gulfs and vast saggings and the left leg too hastily rolled up had descended with a distinctively elephantine effect as margaret had observed certainly the child sir lancelot was at least a sight it is probable that a great many in that hall must have had even then a consciousness that they were looking on at history in the making a supreme act is recognizable at sight it bears the birthmark of immortality but penrod that marvellous boy had begun to declaim even with the gesture of flinging off his mantle for the accolade i first the child sir lancelot du lake will volunteer to knighthood take and kneeling here before your throne i vow to he finished his speech unheard the audience had recovered breath but had lost self control and there ensued something later described by a participant as a sort of cultured riot the actors in the pageant were not so dumfounded by penrod's costume as might have been expected a few precocious geniuses perceived that the overalls were the child lancelot's own comment on maternal intentions and these were profoundly impressed they regarded him with the grisly admiration of young and ambitious criminals for a jail mate about to be distinguished by hanging but most of the children simply took it to be the case a little strange but not startling that penrod's mother had dressed him like that which is pathetic they tried to go on with the pageant they made a brief manful effort but the irrepressible outbursts from the audience bewildered them every time sir lancelot du lake the child opened his mouth the great shadowy house fell into an uproar and the children into confusion strong women and brave girls in the audience went out into the lobby shrieking and clinging to one another others remained rocking in their seats helpless and spent the neighbourhood of mrs schofield and margaret became tactfully a desert friends of the author went behind the scenes and encountered a hitherto unknown phase of mrs lora rewbush they said afterward that she hardly seemed to know what she was doing she begged to be left alone somewhere with penrod schofield for just a little while they led her away chapter vi evening the sun was setting behind the back fence though at a considerable distance as penrod schofield approached that fence and looked thoughtfully up at the top of it apparently having in mind some purpose to climb up and sit there debating this he passed his fingers gently up and down the backs of his legs and then something seemed to decide him not to sit anywhere he leaned against the fence sighed profoundly and gazed at duke his wistful dog the sigh was reminiscent episodes of simple pathos were passing before his inward eye about the most painful was the vision of lovely marjorie jones weeping with rage as the child sir lancelot was dragged insatiate from the prostrate and howling child sir galahad after an onslaught delivered the precise instant the curtain began to fall upon the demoralized pageant and then oh pangs oh woman she slapped at the ruffian's cheek as he was led past her by a resentful janitor and turning flung her arms round the child sir galahad's neck penrod schofield don't you dare ever speak to me again as long as you live maurice's little white boots and gold tassels had done their work at home the late child sir lancelot was consigned to a locked clothes closet pending the arrival of his father mr schofield came and shortly after there was put into practice an old patriarchal custom it is a custom of inconceivable antiquity probably primordial certainly prehistoric but still in vogue in some remaining citadels of the ancient simplicities of the republic and now therefore in the dusk penrod leaned against the fence and sighed his case is comparable to that of an adult who could have survived a similar experience looking back to the sawdust box fancy pictures this comparable adult a serious and inventive writer engaged in congenial literary activities in a private retreat we see this period marked by the creation of some of the most virile passages of a work dealing exclusively in red corpuscles and huge primal impulses we see this thoughtful man dragged from his calm seclusion to a horrifying publicity forced to adopt the stage and himself a writer compelled to exploit the repulsive sentiments of an author not only personally distasteful to him but whose whole method and school in belles lettres he despises we see him reduced by desperation and modesty to stealing a pair of overalls we conceive him to have ruined then his own reputation and to have utterly disgraced his family next to have engaged in the duello and to have been spurned by his lady love thus lost to him according to her own declaration forever finally we must behold imprisonment by the authorities the third degree and flagellation we conceive our man decided that his career had been perhaps too eventful yet penrod had condensed all of it into eight hours it appears that he had at least some shadowy perception of a recent fulness of life for as he leaned against the fence gazing upon his wistful duke he sighed again and murmured aloud well hasn't this been a day but in a little while a star came out freshly lighted from the highest part of the sky and penrod looking up noticed it casually and a little drowsily he yawned then he sighed once more but not reminiscently evening had come the day was over it was a sigh of pure ennui chapter vii evils of drink next day penrod acquired a dime by a simple and antique process which was without doubt sometimes practised by the boys of babylon when the teacher of his class in sunday school requested the weekly contribution penrod fumbling honestly at first in the wrong pockets managed to look so embarrassed that the gentle lady told him not to mind and said she was often forgetful herself she was so sweet about it that looking into the future penrod began to feel confident of a small but regular income at the close of the afternoon services he did not go home but proceeded to squander the funds just withheld from china upon an orgy of the most pungently forbidden description in a drug emporium near the church he purchased a five cent sack of candy consisting for the most part of the heavily flavoured hoofs of horned cattle but undeniably substantial and so generously capable of resisting solution that the purchaser must needs be avaricious beyond reason who did not realize his money's worth equipped with this collation penrod contributed his remaining nickel to a picture show countenanced upon the seventh day by the legal but not the moral authorities here in cozy darkness he placidly insulted his liver with jaw breaker upon jaw breaker from the paper sack and in a surfeit of content watched the silent actors on the screen one film made a lasting impression upon him it depicted with relentless pathos the drunkard's progress beginning with his conversion to beer in the company of loose travelling men pursuing him through an inexplicable lapse into evening clothes and the society of some remarkably painful ladies next exhibiting the effects of alcohol on the victim's domestic disposition the unfortunate man was seen in the act of striking his wife and subsequently his pleading baby daughter with an abnormally heavy walking stick their flight through the snow to seek the protection of a relative was shown and finally the drunkard's picturesque behaviour at the portals of a madhouse so fascinated was penrod that he postponed his departure until this film came round again by which time he had finished his unnatural repast and almost but not quite decided against following the profession of a drunkard when he grew up emerging satiated from the theatre a public timepiece before a jeweller's shop confronted him with an unexpected dial and imminent perplexities how was he to explain at home these hours of dalliance there was a steadfast rule that he return direct from sunday school and sunday rules were important because on that day there was his father always at home and at hand perilously ready for action one of the hardest conditions of boyhood is the almost continuous strain put upon the powers of invention by the constant and harassing necessity for explanations of every natural act proceeding homeward through the deepening twilight as rapidly as possible at a gait half skip and half canter penrod made up his mind in what manner he would account for his long delay and as he drew nearer rehearsed in words the opening passage of his defence now see here he determined to begin i do not wished to be blamed for things i couldn't help nor any other boy i was going along the street by a cottage and a lady put her head out of the window and said her husband was drunk and whipping her and her little girl and she asked me wouldn't i come in and help hold him so i went in and tried to get hold of this drunken lady's husband where he was whipping their baby daughter but he wouldn't pay any attention and i told her i ought to be getting home but she kep on askin me to stay at this point he reached the corner of his own yard where a coincidence not only checked the rehearsal of his eloquence but happily obviated all occasion for it a cab from the station drew up in front of the gate and there descended a troubled lady in black and a fragile little girl about three mrs schofield rushed from the house and enfolded both in hospitable arms they were penrod's aunt clara and cousin also clara from dayton illinois and in the flurry of their arrival everybody forgot to put penrod to the question it is doubtful however if he felt any relief there may have been even a slight unconscious disappointment not altogether dissimilar to that of an actor deprived of a good part in the course of some really necessary preparations for dinner he stepped from the bathroom into the pink and white bedchamber of his sister and addressed her rather thickly through a towel when'd mamma find out aunt clara and cousin clara were coming not till she saw them from the window she just happened to look out as they drove up aunt clara telegraphed this morning but it wasn't delivered how long they goin to stay i don't know penrod ceased to rub his shining face and thoughtfully tossed the towel through the bathroom door uncle john won't try to make em come back home i guess will he uncle john was aunt clara's husband a successful manufacturer of stoves and his lifelong regret was that he had not entered the baptist ministry he'll let em stay here quietly won't he what are you talking about demanded margaret turning from her mirror uncle john sent them here why shouldn't he let them stay penrod looked crestfallen then he hasn't taken to drink certainly not she emphasized the denial with a pretty peal of soprano laughter then why asked her brother gloomily why did aunt clara look so worried when she got here good gracious don't people worry about anything except somebody's drinking where did you get such an idea well he persisted you don't know it ain't that she laughed again wholeheartedly poor uncle john he won't even allow grape juice or ginger ale in his house they came because they were afraid little clara might catch the measles she's very delicate and there's such an epidemic of measles among the children over in dayton the schools had to be closed uncle john got so worried that last night he dreamed about it and this morning he couldn't stand it any longer and packed them off over here though he thinks its wicked to travel on sunday and aunt clara was worried when she got here because they'd forgotten to check her trunk and it will have to be sent by express now what in the name of the common sense put it into your head that uncle john had taken to oh nothing he turned lifelessly away and went downstairs a new born hope dying in his bosom life seems so needlessly dull sometimes chapter viii school next morning when he had once more resumed the dreadful burden of education it seemed infinitely duller and yet what pleasanter sight is there than a schoolroom well filled with children of those sprouting years just before the teens the casual visitor gazing from the teacher's platform upon these busy little heads needs only a blunted memory to experience the most agreeable and exhilarating sensations still for the greater part the children are unconscious of the happiness of their condition for nothing is more pathetically true than that we never know when we are well off the boys in a public school are less aware of their happy state than are the girls and of all the boys in his room probably penrod himself had the least appreciation of his felicity he sat staring at an open page of a textbook but not studying not even reading not even thinking nor was he lost in a reverie his mind's eye was shut as his physical eye might well have been for the optic nerve flaccid with ennui conveyed nothing whatever of the printed page upon which the orb of vision was partially focused penrod was doing something very unusual and rare something almost never accomplished except by coloured people or by a boy in school on a spring day he was doing really nothing at all he was merely a state of being from the street a sound stole in through the open window and abhorring nature began to fill the vacuum called penrod schofield for the sound was the spring song of a mouth organ coming down the sidewalk the windows were intentionally above the level of the eyes of the seated pupils but the picture of the musician was plain to penrod painted for him by a quality in the runs and trills partaking of the oboe of the calliope and of cats in anguish an excruciating sweetness obtained only by the wallowing walloping yellow pink palm of a hand whose back was congo black and shiny the music came down the street and passed beneath the window accompanied by the care free shuffling of a pair of old shoes scuffing syncopations on the cement sidewalk it passed into the distance became faint and blurred was gone emotion stirred in penrod a great and poignant desire but perhaps fortunately no fairy godmother made her appearance otherwise penrod would have gone down the street in a black skin playing the mouth organ and an unprepared coloured youth would have found himself enjoying educational advantages for which he had no ambition whatever roused from perfect apathy the boy cast about the schoolroom an eye wearied to nausea by the perpetual vision of the neat teacher upon the platform"
