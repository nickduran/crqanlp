not weary of it like men fiddlers it takes the mind out of doors and though we should be grateful for good houses there is after all no house like god's out of doors and lastly sir it quiets a man down like saying his prayers so here sir i take my kind leave of you until to morrow and it is my prayerful wish that you may slumber like a prince and the old man with the twentieth courteous inclination left his guest alone chapter iii in which the prince comforts age and beauty and delivers a lecture on discretion in love the prince was early abroad in the time of the first chorus of birds of the pure and quiet air of the slanting sunlight and the mile long shadows to one who had passed a miserable night the freshness of that hour was tonic and reviving to steal a march upon his slumbering fellows to be the adam of the coming day composed and fortified his spirits and the prince breathing deep and pausing as he went walked in the wet fields beside his shadow and was glad a trellised path led down into the valley of the brook and he turned to follow it the stream was a break neck boiling highland river hard by the farm it leaped a little precipice in a thick grey mare's tail of twisted filaments and then lay and worked and bubbled in a lynn into the middle of this quaking pool a rock protruded shelving to a cape and thither otto scrambled and sat down to ponder soon the sun struck through the screen of branches and thin early leaves that made a hanging bower above the fall and the golden lights and flitting shadows fell upon and marbled the surface of that so seething pot and rays plunged deep among the turning waters and a spark as bright as a diamond lit upon the swaying eddy it began to grow warm where otto lingered warm and heady the lights swam weaving their maze across the shaken pool on the impending rock reflections danced like butterflies and the air was fanned by the waterfall as by a swinging curtain otto who was weary with tossing and beset with horrid phantoms of remorse and jealousy instantly fell dead in love with that sun chequered echoing corner holding his feet he stared out of a drowsy trance wondering admiring musing losing his way among uncertain thoughts there is nothing that so apes the external bearing of free will as that unconscious bustle obscurely following liquid laws with which a river contends among obstructions it seems the very play of man and destiny and as otto pored on these recurrent changes he grew by equal steps the sleepier and the more profound eddy and prince were alike jostled in their purpose alike anchored by intangible influences in one corner of the world eddy and prince were alike useless starkly useless in the cosmology of men eddy and prince prince and eddy it is probable he had been some while asleep when a voice recalled him from oblivion sir it was saying and looking round he saw mr killian's daughter terrified by her boldness and making bashful signals from the shore she was a plain honest lass healthy and happy and good and with that sort of beauty that comes of happiness and health but her confusion lent her for the moment an additional charm good morning said otto rising and moving towards her i arose early and was in a dream o sir she cried i wish to beg of you to spare my father for i assure your highness if he had known who you was he would have bitten his tongue out sooner and fritz too how he went on but i had a notion and this morning i went straight down into the stable and there was your highness's crown upon the stirrup irons but o sir i made certain you would spare them for they were as innocent as lambs my dear said otto both amused and gratified you do not understand it is i who am in the wrong for i had no business to conceal my name and lead on these gentleman to speak of me and it is i who have to beg of you that you will keep my secret and not betray the discourtesy of which i was guilty as for any fear of me your friends are safe in gerolstein and even in my own territory you must be well aware i have no power o sir she said curtsying i would not say that the huntsmen would all die for you happy prince said otto but although you are too courteous to avow the knowledge you have had many opportunities of learning that i am a vain show only last night we heard it very clearly stated you see the shadow flitting on this hard rock prince otto i am afraid is but the moving shadow and the name of the rock is gondremark ah if your friends had fallen foul of gondremark but happily the younger of the two admires him and as for the old gentleman your father he is a wise man and an excellent talker and i would take a long wager he is honest o for honest your highness that he is exclaimed the girl and fritz is as honest as he and as for all they said it was just talk and nonsense when countryfolk get gossiping they go on i do assure you for the fun they don't as much as think of what they say if you went to the next farm it's my belief you would hear as much against my father nay nay said otto there you go too fast for all that was said against prince otto o it was shameful cried the girl not shameful true returned otto o yes true i am all they said of me all that and worse i never cried ottilia is that how you do well you would never be a soldier now if any one accuses me i get up and give it them o i defend myself i wouldn't take a fault at another person's hands no not if i had it on my forehead and that's what you must do if you mean to live it out but indeed i never heard such nonsense i should think you was ashamed of yourself you're bald then i suppose o no said otto fairly laughing there i acquit myself not bald well and good pursued the girl come now you know you are good and i'll make you say so your highness i beg your humble pardon but there's no disrespect intended and anyhow you know you are why now what am i to say replied otto you are a cook and excellently well you do it i embrace the chance of thanking you for the ragout well now have you not seen good food so bedevilled by unskilful cookery that no one could be brought to eat the pudding that is me my dear i am full of good ingredients but the dish is worthless i am i give it you in one word sugar in the salad well i don't care you're good reiterated ottilia a little flushed by having failed to understand i will tell you one thing replied otto you are ah well that's what they all said of you moralised the girl such a tongue to come round such a flattering tongue o you forget i am a man of middle age the prince chuckled well to speak to you i should think you was a boy and prince or no prince if you came worrying where i was cooking i would pin a napkin to your tails and o lord i declare i hope your highness will forgive me the girl added i can't keep it in my mind no more can i cried otto that is just what they complain of they made a loverly looking couple only the heavy pouring of that horse tail of water made them raise their voices above lovers pitch but to a jealous onlooker from above their mirth and close proximity might easily give umbrage and a rough voice out of a tuft of brambles began calling on ottilia by name she changed colour at that it is fritz she said i must go go my dear and i need not bid you go in peace for i think you have discovered that i am not formidable at close quarters said the prince and made her a fine gesture of dismissal so ottilia skipped up the bank and disappeared into the thicket stopping once for a single blushing bob blushing because she had in the interval once more forgotten and remembered the stranger's quality otto returned to his rock promontory but his humour had in the meantime changed the sun now shone more fairly on the pool and over its brown welling surface the blue of heaven and the golden green of the spring foliage danced in fleeting arabesque the eddies laughed and brightened with essential colour and the beauty of the dell began to rankle in the prince's mind it was so near to his own borders yet without he had never had much of the joy of possessorship in any of the thousand and one beautiful and curious things that were his and now he was conscious of envy for what was another's it was indeed a smiling dilettante sort of envy but yet there it was the passion of ahab for the vineyard done in little and he was relieved when mr killian appeared upon the scene i hope sir that you have slept well under my plain roof said the old farmer i am admiring this sweet spot that you are privileged to dwell in replied otto evading the inquiry it is rustic returned mr gottesheim looking around him with complacency a very rustic corner and some of the land to the west is most excellent fat land excellent deep soil you should see my wheat in the ten acre field there is not a farm in grunewald no nor many in gerolstein to match the river farm some sixty i keep thinking when i sow some sixty and some seventy and some an hundredfold and my own place six score but that sir is partly the farming and the stream has fish asked otto a fish pond said the farmer ay it is a pleasant bit it is pleasant even here if one had time with the brook drumming in that black pool and the green things hanging all about the rocks and dear heart to see the very pebbles all turned to gold and precious stones but you have come to that time of life sir when if you will excuse me you must look to have the rheumatism set in thirty to forty is as one may say their seed time and this is a damp cold corner for the early morning and an empty stomach if i might humbly advise you sir i would be moving with all my heart said otto gravely and so you have lived your life here he added as they turned to go here i was born replied the farmer and here i wish i could say i was to die but fortune sir fortune turns the wheel they say she is blind but we will hope she only sees a little farther on my grandfather and my father and i we have all tilled these acres my furrow following theirs all the three names are on the garden bench two killians and one johann yes sir good men have prepared themselves for the great change in my old garden well do i mind my father in a woollen night cap the good soul going round and round to see the last of it killian said he do you see the smoke of my tobacco why said he that is man's life it was his last pipe and i believe he knew it and it was a strange thing without doubt to leave the trees that he had planted and the son that he had begotten ay sir and even the old pipe with the turk's head that he had smoked since he was a lad and went a courting but here we have no continuing city and as for the eternal it's a comfortable thought that we have other merits than our own and yet you would hardly think how sore it goes against the grain with me to die in a strange bed and must you do so for what reason otto asked the reason the place is to be sold three thousand crowns replied mr gottesheim had it been a third of that i may say without boasting that what with my credit and my savings i could have met the sum but at three thousand unless i have singular good fortune and the new proprietor continues me in office there is nothing left me but to budge otto's fancy for the place redoubled at the news and became joined with other feelings if all he heard were true grunewald was growing very hot for a sovereign prince it might be well to have a refuge and if so what more delightful hermitage could man imagine mr gottesheim besides had touched his sympathies every man loves in his soul to play the part of the stage deity and to step down to the aid of the old farmer who had so roughly handled him in talk was the ideal of a fair revenge otto's thoughts brightened at the prospect and he began to regard himself with a renewed respect i can find you i believe a purchaser he said and one who would continue to avail himself of your skill can you sir indeed said the old man well i shall be heartily obliged for i begin to find a man may practise resignation all his days as he takes physic and not come to like it in the end if you will have the papers drawn you may even burthen the purchase with your interest said otto let it be assured to you through life your friend sir insinuated killian would not perhaps care to make the interest reversible fritz is a good lad fritz is young said the prince dryly he must earn consideration not inherit he has long worked upon the place sir insisted mr gottesheim and at my great age for i am seventy eight come harvest it would be a troublesome thought to the proprietor how to fill my shoes it would be a care spared to assure yourself of fritz and i believe he might be tempted by a permanency the young man has unsettled views returned otto possibly the purchaser began killian a little spot of anger burned in otto's cheek i am the purchaser he said it was what i might have guessed replied the farmer bowing with an aged obsequious dignity you have made an old man very happy and i may say indeed that i have entertained an angel unawares sir the great people of this world and by that i mean those who are great in station if they had only hearts like yours how they would make the fires burn and the poor sing i would not judge them hardly sir said otto we all have our frailties truly sir said mr gottesheim with unction and by what name sir am i to address my generous landlord the double recollection of an english traveller whom he had received the week before at court and of an old english rogue called transome whom he had known in youth came pertinently to the prince's help transome he answered is my name i am an english traveller it is to day tuesday on thursday before noon the money shall be ready let us meet if you please in mittwalden at the morning star i am in all things lawful your servant to command replied the farmer an englishman you are a great race of travellers and has your lordship some experience of land i have had some interest of the kind before returned the prince not in gerolstein indeed but fortune as you say turns the wheel and i desire to be beforehand with her revolutions very right sir i am sure said mr killian they had been strolling with deliberation but they were now drawing near to the farmhouse mounting by the trellised pathway to the level of the meadow a little before them the sound of voices had been some while audible and now grew louder and more distinct with every step of their advance presently when they emerged upon the top of the bank they beheld fritz and ottilia some way off he very black and bloodshot emphasising his hoarse speech with the smacking of his fist against his palm she standing a little way off in blowsy voluble distress dear me said mr gottesheim and made as if he would turn aside but otto went straight towards the lovers in whose dissension he believed himself to have a share and indeed as soon as he had seen the prince fritz had stood tragic as if awaiting and defying his approach o here you are he cried as soon as they were near enough for easy speech you are a man at least and must reply what were you after why were you two skulking in the bush god he broke out turning again upon ottilia to think that i should waste my heart on you i beg your pardon otto cut in you were addressing me in virtue of what circumstance am i to render you an account of this young lady's conduct are you her father her brother her husband o sir you know as well as i returned the peasant we keep company she and i i love her and she is by way of loving me but all shall be above board i would have her to know i have a good pride of my own why i perceive i must explain to you what love is said otto its measure is kindness it is very possible that you are proud but she too may have some self esteem i do not speak for myself and perhaps if your own doings were so curiously examined you might find it inconvenient to reply these are all set offs said the young man you know very well that a man is a man and a woman only a woman that holds good all over up and down i ask you a question i ask it again and here i stand he drew a mark and toed it when you have studied liberal doctrines somewhat deeper said the prince you will perhaps change your note you are a man of false weights and measures my young friend you have one scale for women another for men one for princes and one for farmer folk on the prince who neglects his wife you can be most severe but what of the lover who insults his mistress you use the name of love i should think this lady might very fairly ask to be delivered from love of such a nature for if i a stranger had been one tenth part so gross and so discourteous you would most righteously have broke my head it would have been in your part as lover to protect her from such insolence protect her first then from yourself ay quoth mr gottesheim who had been looking on with his hands behind his tall old back ay that's scripture truth fritz was staggered not only by the prince's imperturbable superiority of manner but by a glimmering consciousness that he himself was in the wrong the appeal to liberal doctrines had besides unmanned him well said he if i was rude i'll own to it i meant no ill and did nothing out of my just rights but i am above all these old vulgar notions too and if i spoke sharp i'll ask her pardon freely granted fritz said ottilia but all this doesn't answer me cried fritz i ask what you two spoke about she says she promised not to tell well then i mean to know civility is civility but i'll be no man's gull i have a right to common justice if i _do_ keep company if you will ask mr gottesheim replied otto you will find i have not spent my hours in idleness i have since i arose this morning agreed to buy the farm so far i will go to satisfy a curiosity which i condemn o well if there was business that's another matter returned fritz though it beats me why you could not tell but of course if the gentleman is to buy the farm i suppose there would naturally be an end to be sure said mr gottesheim with a strong accent of conviction but ottilia was much braver there now she cried in triumph what did i tell you i told you i was fighting your battles now you see think shame of your suspicious temper you should go down upon your bended knees both to that gentleman and me chapter iv in which the prince collects opinions by the way a little before noon otto by a triumph of manoeuvring effected his escape he was quit in this way of the ponderous gratitude of mr killian and of the confidential gratitude of poor ottilia but of fritz he was not quit so readily that young politician brimming with mysterious glances offered to lend his convoy as far as to the high road and otto in fear of some residuary jealousy and for the girl's sake had not the courage to gainsay him but he regarded his companion with uneasy glances and devoutly wished the business at an end for some time fritz walked by the mare in silence and they had already traversed more than half the proposed distance when with something of a blush he looked up and opened fire are you not he asked what they call a socialist why no returned otto not precisely what they call so why do you ask i will tell you why said the young man i saw from the first that you were a red progressional and nothing but the fear of old killian kept you back and there sir you were right old men are always cowards but nowadays you see there are so many groups you can never tell how far the likeliest kind of man may be prepared to go and i was never sure you were one of the strong thinkers till you hinted about women and free love indeed cried otto i never said a word of such a thing not you cried fritz never a word to compromise you was sowing seed ground bait our president calls it but it's hard to deceive me for i know all the agitators and their ways and all the doctrines and between you and me lowering his voice i am myself affiliated o yes i am a secret society man and here is my medal and drawing out a green ribbon that he wore about his neck he held up for otto's inspection a pewter medal bearing the imprint of a phoenix and the legend _libertas_ and so now you see you may trust me added fritz i am none of your alehouse talkers i am a convinced revolutionary and he looked meltingly upon otto i see replied the prince that is very gratifying well sir the great thing for the good of one's country is first of all to be a good man all springs from there for my part although you are right in thinking that i have to do with politics i am unfit by intellect and temper for a leading role i was intended i fear for a subaltern yet we have all something to command mr fritz if it be only our own temper and a man about to marry must look closely to himself the husband's like the prince's is a very artificial standing and it is hard to be kind in either do you follow that o yes i follow that replied the young man sadly chop fallen over the nature of the information he had elicited and then brightening up is it he ventured is it for an arsenal that you have bought the farm we'll see about that the prince answered laughing you must not be too zealous and in the meantime if i were you i would say nothing on the subject o trust me sir for that cried fritz as he pocketed a crown and you've let nothing out for i suspected i might say i knew it from the first and mind you when a guide is required he added i know all the forest paths otto rode away chuckling this talk with fritz had vastly entertained him nor was he altogether discontented with his bearing at the farm men he was able to tell himself had behaved worse under smaller provocation and to harmonise all the road and the april air were both delightful to his soul up and down and to and fro ever mounting through the wooded foothills the broad white high road wound onward into grunewald on either hand the pines stood coolly rooted green moss prospering springs welling forth between their knuckled spurs and though some were broad and stalwart and others spiry and slender yet all stood firm in the same attitude and with the same expression like a silent army presenting arms the road lay all the way apart from towns and villages which it left on either hand here and there indeed in the bottom of green glens the prince could spy a few congregated roofs or perhaps above him on a shoulder the solitary cabin of a woodman but the highway was an international undertaking and with its face set for distant cities scorned the little life of grunewald hence it was exceeding solitary near the frontier otto met a detachment of his own troops marching in the hot dust and he was recognised and somewhat feebly cheered as he rode by but from that time forth and for a long while he was alone with the great woods gradually the spell of pleasure relaxed his own thoughts returned like stinging insects in a cloud and the talk of the night before like a shower of buffets fell upon his memory he looked east and west for any comforter and presently he was aware of a cross road coming steeply down hill and a horseman cautiously descending a human voice or presence like a spring in the desert was now welcome in itself and otto drew bridle to await the coming of this stranger he proved to be a very red faced thick lipped countryman with a pair of fat saddle bags and a stone bottle at his waist who as soon as the prince hailed him jovially if somewhat thickly answered at the same time he gave a beery yaw in the saddle it was clear his bottle was no longer full do you ride towards mittwalden asked the prince as far as the cross road to tannenbrunn the man replied will you bear company with pleasure i have even waited for you on the chance answered otto by this time they were close alongside and the man with the countryfolk instinct turned his cloudy vision first of all on his companion's mount the devil he cried you ride a bonny mare friend and then his curiosity being satisfied about the essential he turned his attention to that merely secondary matter his companion's face he started the prince he cried saluting with another yaw that came near dismounting him i beg your pardon your highness not to have recognised you at once the prince was vexed out of his self possession since you know me he said it is unnecessary we should ride together i will precede you if you please and he was about to set spur to the grey mare when the half drunken fellow reaching over laid his hand upon the rein hark you he said prince or no prince that is not how one man should conduct himself with another what you'll ride with me incog and set me talking but if i know you you'll preshede me if you please spy and the fellow crimson with drink and injured vanity almost spat the word into the prince's face a horrid confusion came over otto he perceived that he had acted rudely grossly presuming on his station and perhaps a little shiver of physical alarm mingled with his remorse for the fellow was very powerful and not more than half in the possession of his senses take your hand from my rein he said with a sufficient assumption of command and when the man rather to his wonder had obeyed you should understand sir he added that while i might be glad to ride with you as one person of sagacity with another and so receive your true opinions it would amuse me very little to hear the empty compliments you would address to me as prince you think i"
