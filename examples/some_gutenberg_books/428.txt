"1" "meal a stylishly dressed young woman came in and sat down at a table at the end of the room farthest from where i was i should have noticed her more but i was in a reverie about mary's admirable charms and i only just looked at her she was frowning and drumming angrily with her fingers on the table the head waiter hurried up to her his face was covered with smiles and he gave me a confidential nod en passant nothing else occurred except that a villainous looking fellow something to judge by his appearance between a valet and a secretary thrust his ugly head through the door three or four times whenever he did so the waiter smiled blandly at him he did it the last time just as the lady was walking down the room seeing her coming he drew back and held the door open for her with a clumsy apologetic bow she smiled scornfully and passed through the waiter stood grinning in the middle of the room and when i in my turn rose he whispered to me it's all right sir i went to bed and dreamed of mary on entering the room next morning the first person i saw was mary she was looking adorably fresh and pretty she sat opposite a stout severe looking dame in black directly my eyes alighted on her i schooled them into a studiously vacant expression she poor girl was no diplomatist she started she glanced anxiously at miss dibbs i saw her lips move she blushed she seemed almost to smile of course this behavior i loved mary the more that she could not conceal her delightful embarrassment excited the dragon's curiosity she turned round and favored me with a searching gaze i was equal to the occasion i comprehended them both in a long cool deliberate empty stare the strain on my self control was immense but i supported it mary blushed crimson and her eyes sank to her plate poor girl she had sadly overrated her powers of deception i was not surprised that miss dibbs frowned severely and sniffed audibly at that moment the other girl came in she walked up took the table next to mine and to my confusion bestowed upon me a look of evident interest though of the utmost shortness one of those looks you know that seem to be repented of in an instant and are generally the most deliberate i took no notice at all assuming an air of entire unconsciousness a few minutes later mary got up and made for the door with miss dibbs in close attendance the imprudent child could not forbear to glance at me but i seeing the dragon's watchful eye upon me remained absolutely irresponsive nay to throw miss dibbs off the scent i fixed my eyes on my neighbor with assumed preoccupation flushing painfully mary hurried out and i heard miss dibbs sniff again i chuckled over her obvious disapproval of my neighbor and myself the excellent woman evidently thought us no better than we ought to be but i felt that i should go mad if i could not speak to mary soon i went out and sat down in the veranda it was then about half past ten the ugly fellow whom i had noticed the evening before was hanging about but presently a waiter came and spoke to him and he got up with a grumble and went into the house ten minutes afterward my neighbor of the salle a manger came out she looked very discontented she rang a handbell that stood on the table and a waiter ran up where's the head waiter she asked sharply pardon ma'mselle but he is waiting on some ladies upstairs what a nuisance said she but you'll do i want to give him an order stay come indoors and i'll write it down she disappeared and i sat on wondering how i was to get a sight of mary at last in weariness i went indoors to the smoking room it looked out to the back and was a dreary little room but i lit my cigar and began on a three days old copy of the times thus i spent a tedious hour then my friend the head waiter appeared looking more roguish than ever i dived into my pocket he produced a note i seized it why have you been so long charmingly unreasonable what could i have done directly you get this come to the wood behind the hotel take the path to the right and go straight till you find me i have thrown the spy poor old dibbs off the scent m i caught up my hat and rushed into the hall i cannoned into a young man who had just got out of a carriage and was standing in the veranda with a hasty apology i dashed on beyond doubt she loved me and she was honest enough not to conceal it i hate mock modesty i longed to show her how truly i returned her love and i rejoiced that there need be no tedious preliminaries mary and i understood one another a kiss would be the seal of our love and the most suitable beginning of our conversation in five minutes i was in the wood just before i disappeared among its trees i heard someone calling monsieur monsieur it sounded like the voice of the head waiter but i wouldn't have stopped for fifty head waiters i took the path mary had indicated and ran along it at the top of my speed suddenly to my joy i caught sight of the figure of a girl she was seated on a mound of grass and though her face was from me i made no doubt it was mary she wore the most charming blue cloak it was a chilly morning which completely enveloped her i determined not to shilly shally she loved me i loved her i ran forward plumped down on my knees behind her took her head between my hands dodged round and kissed her cheek at last my darling i cried in passionate tones by jupiter it was the other girl though i sprang back in horror the girl looked at me for a moment then she blushed then she frowned then why then she began to laugh consumedly i was amazed at last you call it she gasped i call it at first and she laughed merrily and melodiously she certainly had a nice laugh that girl now concerning what follows i have since then entertained some doubts whether i behaved in all respects discreetly you will allow that the position was a difficult one but it is i admit very possible that my wisest course would have been to make an apology and turn tail as quickly as i could well i didn't i thought that i owed the lady a full explanation besides i wanted a full explanation myself finally oh yes i see you fellows grinning and winking mary was not there and this young lady rather interested me i decided that i would have five minutes talk with her then i would run back and find mary i must beg a thousand pardons i began but i took you for somebody else oh of course said she with a shrug it's always that you appear incredulous said i rather offended well and if i am said she my feelings were hurt i produced mary's second note if i can trust to your discretion i'll prove what i say i remarked in a nettled tone i shall be very curious to hear the proof sir and i will be most discreet she said she was pouting but her eyes danced really she looked very pretty although of course i would not for a moment compare her with lady mary a lady said i was so kind as to tell me to seek her here this morning oh as if i believed that i was piqued there's the proof i cried flinging the note into her lap she took it up glanced at it and gave a little shriek where did you get this why from the head waiter oh the fool she cried it's mine yours nonsense he gave me that and another last night oh the stupidity they were for they were not for you they were for someone who is to arrive i pointed at the signature and gasped m do you sign m yes my name's my name begins with m oh if i'd only seen that waiter this morning oh the idiot then i believe i swore madame said i i'm ruined no harm is done to you i'm a man of honor but i'm ruined on the strength of your wretched notes madame i've cut the girl i love best in the world cut her dead dead dead what that young lady in the oh you thought they were from her oh i see how how oh how very amusing and the heartless little wretch went off into another peal of laughter you pretended not to know her oh dear oh dear and her laughter echoed among the trees again i saw her looking at you and you ate on like a pig oh dear oh dear stop laughing said i savagely oh i'm very sorry but i can't what a scrape you've go into oh me and she wiped her eyes they were as blue as her cloak with a delicate bit of a handkerchief you shan't laugh said i who were your notes for somebody i expected he hasn't come the waiter took you for him i suppose i never thought of his being so stupid oh what a brute she must have thought you and she began to laugh again i had had enough of it i hate being laughed at if you go on laughing said i i'll kiss you again the threat was a failure she did not appear at all alarmed not you she said laughing worse than ever i should like you fellows to understand that my heart never wavered in its allegiance to lady mary my conscience is quite clear as to that but i had pledged my word i caught that tiresome girl round the waist and i kissed her once i'm sure of once anyhow she gasped and struggled laughing still then with a sudden change of voice she cried stop stop i let her go i looked round we had a gallery of spectators on one side stood the ugly headed valet on the other in attitudes of horror mary and miss dibbs you've ruined us both now said the girl in blue i rose to my feet and was about to explain when the ugly fellow rushed at me brandishing a cane i had quite enough to arrange without being bothered by him i caught the cane in my left hand and with my right i knocked him down then i walked up to lady mary i took no heed of miss dibbs presence it was too critical a moment to think of trifles lady mary said i appearances are so much against me that you cannot possibly attach the slightest weight to them sir said she i have no longer the honor of your acquaintance i have only to thank you for having had the consideration not to recognize me when we met so unexpectedly in the dining room pray continue to show me the same favor with which pleasant little speech she turned on her heel it was clear that she suspected me most unjustly i turned to the girl in blue but she was beforehand with me ah i wish i'd never see you she cried you great stupid creature he she pointed to the prostrate figure of the ugly servant will tell frederic everything come said i _i_ was only an accident it would have been just as bad if as i spoke i heard a step behind me turning round i found myself face to face with the young man with whom i had come in collision as i rushed through the hall he gazed at the servant at me at the girl in blue margaret he exclaimed what is the hush hush she whispered pointing again to the servant i stepped up to him lifting my hat sir said i kindly inform me if you are the gentleman who was to come from england certainly i come from england he said and you ought to have arrived on wednesday yes he answered then said i all i have to say to you sir is that i wish to the devil you'd keep your appointments and i left them that's why i'm not married boys where's my glass it is a very curious story observed the colonel and who were they all the girl in blue and the young man and the ugly servant and frederic colonel said jack with an air of deepest mystery you would be astounded to hear we all pricked up our ears but he continued i am not at liberty to say we sank back in our chairs do you know asked the colonel and jack nodded solemnly out with it we cried impossible said jack but i may tell you that the matter engaged the attention of more than one of the foreign offices of europe good heavens cried we in chorus and jack drank off his whisky and water rose to his feet and put on his hat poor dear mary said he as he opened the door she never got over it the colonel shouted after him then what did she marry jenkyns of the blues for pique said jack and he shut the door iii a change of heart it was common knowledge that smugg was engaged to be married familiarity had robbed the fact of some of its surprisingness but there remained a substratum of wonder not removed even by the sight of his betrothed's photograph and the information that she was a distant relative who had been brought up with him from infancy the features and the explanation between them rescued smugg from the incongruity of a romance but we united in the opinion that the lady was ill advised in preferring smugg to solitude still for all that he was a ridiculous creature she did and hence it happened that smugg desiring to form a furnishing fund organized a reading party which gayford tritton bird and i at once joined every morning at nine smugg his breakfast finished cleared his corner of the table opened his books and assumed an expectant air so mary the maid told us we were never there ourselves we breakfasted at 9.30 or 10 o'clock and only about 11 did we clear our corners light our pipes open our books and discuss the prospects of the day as we discussed them smugg construed in a gentle bleat what he construed or why he construed it seeing that nobody heeded him was a mystery the whole performance was simply a tribute to smugg's conscience and as such was received with good natured scornful toleration suddenly a change came one morning there was no smugg yet he had breakfasted mary and an eggshell testified to that effect he reappeared at 11.30 confused and very warm he had exceptional powers in the way of being warm we said nothing and he began to bleat horace in a minute of silence i happened to hear what it was it referred to a lady of the name of pyrrha the learned may identify the passage for themselves the next day the same thing happened except that it was close on twelve before smugg appeared gayford and tritton took no notice of the aberration bird congratulated smugg on the increased docility of his conscience i watched him closely as he wiped his brow he was very warm indeed a third time the scene was enacted my curiosity was aroused i made mary call me very early and from the window i espied smugg leaving the house at 9.15 and going with rapid furtive steps along the little path that led to old dill's tiny farm i slipped downstairs bolted a cup of tea seized a piece of toast and followed smugg he was out of sight but presently i met joe shanks the butcher's son who brought us our chops joe was a stout young man about twenty one red faced burly and greasy we used to have many jokes with joe even smugg had before now broken a mild shaft of classical wit on him in fact we made a butt of joe and his good humored muttony smile told us that he thought it a compliment seen mr smugg as you came along joe i asked yes sir gone toward dill's farm sir ah dill's farm yes sir the chop laden joe passed on i mended my pace and soon found myself on the outskirts of dill's premises i had been there before we had all been there before dill had a daughter i saw her now in a sunbonnet and laced boots i may say at once that betsy dill was very pretty in a fine robust style and all four of us were decidedly enamored of her charms usually we courted her in a body and scrupulous fairness was observed in the matter of seeking private interviews smugg had never spoken to her so we should all have sworn but now my wondering eyes saw opposite pyrrha we began from this day to call her pyrrha the figure of smugg pyrrha was leaning against a barn one foot crossed over the other her arms akimbo a string of her bonnet in her mouth and her blue eyes laughing from under long lashes smugg stood limply opposite her his trousers bagging over his half bent knees his hat in one hand and in the other a handkerchief with which from time to time he mopped his forehead i could not hear of course i did not wish to what they were saying indeed i have my doubts if they said anything but presently smugg moved a hesitating step nearer when pyrrha with a merry laugh darted by him and ran away turning a mocking face over her shoulder smugg stood still for a minute then put on his hat looked at his watch and walked slowly away i did not keep smugg's secret i felt under no obligation to keep it he deserved no mercy and i exposed him at breakfast that very morning but i could not help being a little sorry for him when he came in he bent his head under the shower of reproach chaff and gibing he did not try to excuse himself he simply opened his book at the old place and we all shouted the old ode substituting betsa for pyrrha wherever we could still in spite of our jocularity we all felt an under current of real anger we considered that smugg was treating pyrrha very badly smugg an engaged man aged thirty presumably past the heat and carelessness of youth we glowed with a sense of her wrongs and that afternoon we each went for a solitary walk at least we started for a solitary walk but half an hour later we all met at the gate leading to dill's meadows and in an explosion of laughter acknowledged our secret design of meeting pyrrha and opening her eyes to smugg's iniquity the great surprise was still to come at eleven the next morning when we had just sat down to work and smugg had slid into the room with the stealthy ashamed air he wore after his morning excursions mary appeared and told us that joe shanks the butcher's son had come with the chops and wanted to speak to us we hailed the diversion and had joe shown in gayford pushed the beer jug and a glass toward him saying help yourself joe joe drank a draught wiped his mouth on his blue sleeve and remarked no offense gentlemen none said gayford who seemed to have assumed the chairmanship of the meeting joe seeming slightly embarrassed cleared his throat and looked round again no offense gentlemen he repeated but she's bin walking with me two years come michaelmas a pause followed then the chairman expressed the views of the meeting the deuce she has said he off and on added joe candidly i looked at smugg he had shrunk down low in his seat and rested his head on his hand his face was half hidden but he was very warm and the drops trickled from his forehead down his nose it seems to be a good deal off said the chairman judicially no offense said joe but i don't take it kind of you gentlemen i've served you faithful the chops are excellent conceded the chairman and i don't take it kind develop your complaint said the chairman i mean what's the row joe since you gentlemen came she's been saucy said joe i do not see observed the chairman that anything can be done if pyrrha prefers us joe he treated the case collectively which was certainly wise what then beg pardon sir oh i mean if the lady prefers us joe joe brought his fat fist down on the table with a thump it aint as if you meant it said he doggedly you just unsettles of er i s'pose i can't help ye talking and laughing and walking along of er but you aint no call to kiss er another pause ensued the chairman held a consultation with tritton who sat on his right hand the meeting said gayford will proceed to declare one by one whether it has ever and if so how often kissed the lady i will begin never mr tritton never said tritton mr bird never said bird mr robertson never said i mr smugg i seed im this very morning cried joe like an accusing angel smugg took his hand away from his face after giving his wet brow one last dab he looked at gayford and at joe but said nothing mr smugg repeated the chairman mr smugg interposed tritton suavely probably feels himself in a difficulty the secret is not perhaps entirely his own we all nodded we enter a plea of not guilty for mr smugg observed the chairman gravely i seed im do it said joe no one spoke joe finished his beer pulled his forelock and turned on his heel suddenly smugg burst into speech he could hardly form his words and they jostled one another in the breathless confusion of his utterance i i you've no right i say nothing if i choose i shall no one has a right to stop me if i love her if she doesn't mind i say nothing nothing at all i won't hear a word i shall do as i like joe had paused to hear him and now stood looking at him in wonder then he stepped quickly up to the table and leaning across asked in a harsh voice you mean honest do you by her you'd make her your wife would you smugg looking straight in front of him answered yes joe drew back touched his forelock again and said then it's fair fighting sir begging your pardon and no offense but the girl was mine first sir then gayford interposed mr smugg said he you tell joe here that you'd marry this lady may i ask how you can when but for once smugg was able to silence one of his pupils he arose from his seat and brought his hand heavily down on gayford's shoulder hold your tongue he cried i must answer to god but i needn't answer to you joe looked at him with round eyes and with a last salute slowly went out none of us spoke and presently smugg opened his thucydides for my part i took very considerable interest in pyrrha's side of the question i amused myself by constructing a fancy born love of pyrrha's for her social superior and if he had been one of ourselves i should have seen no absurdity but smugg refused altogether to fit into my frame there was no glamour about smugg and to tell the truth i should have thought that any girl be her station what it might faced with the alternative of smugg and joe would have chosen joe in my opinion pyrrha was merely amusing herself with smugg and i was rather comforted by this reversal of the ordinary roles still i could not rest in conjecture and my curiosity led me up to dill's little farm on the afternoon of the day of joe's sudden appearance the others let me go alone directly after dinner smugg went to his bedroom and the other three had gone off to play lawn tennis at the vicar's i lit my pipe and strolled along till i reached the gate that led to dill's meadow here i waited till pyrrha should appear as i sat and smoked a voice struck suddenly on my ear the voice of mrs dill raised to shrillness by anger be off with you she said and mind your ways or worse ll happen to you ere's your switch after a moment pyrrha turned the corner and came toward me she was wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron and carried in her hand a light hazel switch which she used to guide errant cows she was almost at the gate before she saw me she started and blushed very red lor is it you mr robertson she said i nodded but did not move let me pass sir please i've no time to stop what not to talk to me pyrrha betsy i mean mother don't like me talking to gentlemen you've been crying said i no i haven't said pyrrha quite violently mother been scolding you i wish you'd let me by sir what for it's all your fault burst out pyrrha i didn't want you no nor him either what do you come and get me into trouble for i haven't done anything betsy come now you aint as bad as some she conceded a dim smile breaking through the clouds you mean smugg i observed who told you she cried joe said i seems he's got a lot to say to everybody she commented resentfully ah he told your mother did he well you know you shouldn't betsy i won't never speak to him again i meant i won't ever the grammarian is abroad mr robertson what not to joe joe no that smugg but joe told of you well and it was his right if she thought so i had no more to say notions differ among different sets but i pressed the point a little joe got you your scolding now i can't say whether i did or did not emphasize the last word unduly but pyrrha blushed again and remarked you want to know too much sir by a deal so i left that aspect to the subject and continued i suppose it was for letting mr smugg kiss you i couldn't help it i had great doubts of that she could have tackled smugg with one hand but i said pleasantly no more could he i'm sure pyrrha cast an alarmed glance at the house oh i'll be careful i laughed yes and i'll let you go but just tell me betsy what do you think of mr smugg i don't think that of him said she snapping her pretty red fingers joe ud make ten of him i wish joe'd talk to him a bit the end came soon after this and in spite of our attitude i speak of us four not of smugg of whole heartedness i think it was rather a shock to us all when joe announced one morning on his arrival with the chops that he was to be made a happy man at the church next day smugg was not in the room and the rest of us congratulated joe and made up a purse for him to give pyrrha with our best respects and he bowed himself out mightily pleased and asseverating that we were real gentlemen then we sat and looked at the table it robs us of a resource pronounced gayford once again making himself the mouthpiece of the party we all nodded and filled fresh pipes presently smugg sidled in we had seen little of him the last week save when he was construing he had taken refuge in his own room when he came in now gayford wagged his head significantly at me apparently it was my task to bell the cat i rose and went to the mantelpiece smugg had sat down at the table and my back was to him i took a match from the box struck it and applied it to my pipe and punctuating my words with interspersed puffings i said carelessly by the way smugg pyrrha's going to be married to joe shanks to morrow i don't know how he looked i kept my face from him but after a long minute's pause he answered thank you robertson it's aeschylus this morning isn't it we had a noisy evening that night i suppose we felt below par and wanted cheering up anyhow we made an expedition to the grocer's and amazed him with a demand for his best champagne and his choicest sherry we carried the goods home in a bag and sat down to"
