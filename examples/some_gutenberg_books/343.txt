not think upon said he i will go to an end with it or perish and when i get home i pray god this may be a dream and i may find my father dancing so he went on after the bloodless thing that had escaped and in the way he met the appearance of his mother and she wept what have you done she cried what is this that you have done oh come home where you may be by bedtime ere you do more ill to me and mine for it is enough to smite my brother and your father dear mother it is not these that i have smitten said jack it was but the enchanter in their shape and even if i had it would not prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg and at this the appearance gobbled like a turkey he never knew how he did that but he swung the sword on the one side and clove the appearance through the midst and it cried out aloud with the voice of his mother and fell to the ground and with the fall of it the house was gone from over jack's head and he stood alone in the woods and the gyve was loosened from his leg well said he the enchanter is now dead and the fetter gone but the cries rang in his soul and the day was like night to him this has been a sore business said he let me get forth out of the wood and see the good that i have done to others he thought to leave the fetter where it lay but when he turned to go his mind was otherwise so he stooped and put the gyve in his bosom and the rough iron galled him as he went and his bosom bled now when he was forth of the wood upon the highway he met folk returning from the field and those he met had no fetter on the right leg but behold they had one upon the left jack asked them what it signified and they said that was the new wear for the old was found to be a superstition then he looked at them nearly and there was a new ulcer on the left ankle and the old one on the right was not yet healed now may god forgive me cried jack i would i were well home and when he was home there lay his uncle smitten on the head and his father pierced through the heart and his mother cloven through the midst and he sat in the lone house and wept beside the bodies moral old is the tree and the fruit good very old and thick the wood woodman is your courage stout beware the root is wrapped about your mother's heart your father's bones and like the mandrake comes with groans ix the four reformers four reformers met under a bramble bush they were all agreed the world must be changed we must abolish property said one we must abolish marriage said the second we must abolish god said the third i wish we could abolish work said the fourth do not let us get beyond practical politics said the first the first thing is to reduce men to a common level the first thing said the second is to give freedom to the sexes the first thing said the third is to find out how to do it the first step said the first is to abolish the bible the first thing said the second is to abolish the laws the first thing said the third is to abolish mankind x the man and his friend a man quarrelled with his friend i have been much deceived in you said the man and the friend made a face at him and went away a little after they both died and came together before the great white justice of the peace it began to look black for the friend but the man for a while had a clear character and was getting in good spirits i find here some record of a quarrel said the justice looking in his notes which of you was in the wrong he was said the man he spoke ill of me behind my back did he so said the justice and pray how did he speak about your neighbours oh he had always a nasty tongue said the man and you chose him for your friend cried the justice my good fellow we have no use here for fools so the man was cast in the pit and the friend laughed out aloud in the dark and remained to be tried on other charges xi the reader i never read such an impious book said the reader throwing it on the floor you need not hurt me said the book you will only get less for me second hand and i did not write myself that is true said the reader my quarrel is with your author ah well said the book you need not buy his rant that is true said the reader but i thought him such a cheerful writer i find him so said the book you must be differently made from me said the reader let me tell you a fable said the book there were two men wrecked upon a desert island one of them made believe he was at home the other admitted oh i know your kind of fable said the reader they both died and so they did said the book no doubt of that and everybody else that is true said the reader push it a little further for this once and when they were all dead they were in god's hands the same as before said the book not much to boast of by your account cried the reader who is impious now said the book and the reader put him on the fire the coward crouches from the rod and loathes the iron face of god xii the citizen and the traveller look round you said the citizen this is the largest market in the world oh surely not said the traveller well perhaps not the largest said the citizen but much the best you are certainly wrong there said the traveller i can tell you they buried the stranger at the dusk xiii the distinguished stranger once upon a time there came to this earth a visitor from a neighbouring planet and he was met at the place of his descent by a great philosopher who was to show him everything first of all they came through a wood and the stranger looked upon the trees whom have we here said he these are only vegetables said the philosopher they are alive but not at all interesting i don't know about that said the stranger they seem to have very good manners do they never speak they lack the gift said the philosopher yet i think i hear them sing said the other that is only the wind among the leaves said the philosopher i will explain to you the theory of winds it is very interesting well said the stranger i wish i knew what they are thinking they cannot think said the philosopher i don't know about that returned the stranger and then laying his hand upon a trunk i like these people said he they are not people at all said the philosopher come along next they came through a meadow where there were cows these are very dirty people said the stranger they are not people at all said the philosopher and he explained what a cow is in scientific words which i have forgotten that is all one to me said the stranger but why do they never look up because they are graminivorous said the philosopher and to live upon grass which is not highly nutritious requires so close an attention to business that they have no time to think or speak or look at the scenery or keep themselves clean well said the stranger that is one way to live no doubt but i prefer the people with the green heads next they came into a city and the streets were full of men and women these are very odd people said the stranger they are the people of the greatest nation in the world said the philosopher are they indeed said the stranger they scarcely look so xiv the cart horses and the saddle horse two cart horses a gelding and a mare were brought to samoa and put in the same field with a saddle horse to run free on the island they were rather afraid to go near him for they saw he was a saddle horse and supposed he would not speak to them now the saddle horse had never seen creatures so big these must be great chiefs thought he and he approached them civilly lady and gentleman said he i understand you are from the colonies i offer you my affectionate compliments and make you heartily welcome to the islands the colonials looked at him askance and consulted with each other who can he be said the gelding he seems suspiciously civil said the mare i do not think he can be much account said the gelding depend upon it he is only a kanaka said the mare then they turned to him go to the devil said the gelding i wonder at your impudence speaking to persons of our quality cried the mare the saddle horse went away by himself i was right said he they are great chiefs xv the tadpole and the frog be ashamed of yourself said the frog when i was a tadpole i had no tail just what i thought said the tadpole you never were a tadpole xvi something in it the natives told him many tales in particular they warned him of the house of yellow reeds tied with black sinnet how any one who touched it became instantly the prey of akaanga and was handed on to him by miru the ruddy and hocussed with the kava of the dead and baked in the ovens and eaten by the eaters of the dead there is nothing in it said the missionary there was a bay upon that island a very fair bay to look upon but by the native saying it was death to bathe there there is nothing in that said the missionary and he came to the bay and went swimming presently an eddy took him and bore him towards the reef oho thought the missionary it seems there is something in it after all and he swam the harder but the eddy carried him away i do not care about this eddy said the missionary and even as he said it he was aware of a house raised on piles above the sea it was built of yellow reeds one reed joined with another and the whole bound with black sinnet a ladder led to the door and all about the house hung calabashes he had never seen such a house nor yet such calabashes and the eddy set for the ladder this is singular said the missionary but there can be nothing in it and he laid hold of the ladder and went up it was a fine house but there was no man there and when the missionary looked back he saw no island only the heaving of the sea it is strange about the island said the missionary but who's afraid my stories are the true ones and he laid hold of a calabash for he was one that loved curiosities now he had no sooner laid hand upon the calabash than that which he handled and that which he saw and stood on burst like a bubble and was gone and night closed upon him and the waters and the meshes of the net and he wallowed there like a fish a body would think there was something in this said the missionary but if these tales are true i wonder what about my tales now the flaming of akaanga's torch drew near in the night and the misshapen hands groped in the meshes of the net and they took the missionary between the finger and the thumb and bore him dripping in the night and silence to the place of the ovens of miru and there was miru ruddy in the glow of the ovens and there sat her four daughters and made the kava of the dead and there sat the comers out of the islands of the living dripping and lamenting this was a dread place to reach for any of the sons of men but of all who ever came there the missionary was the most concerned and to make things worse the person next him was a convert of his own aha said the convert so you are here like your neighbours and how about all your stories it seems said the missionary with bursting tears that there was nothing in them by this the kava of the dead was ready and the daughters of miru began to intone in the old manner of singing gone are the green islands and the bright sea the sun and the moon and the forty million stars and life and love and hope henceforth is no more only to sit in the night and silence and see your friends devoured for life is a deceit and the bandage is taken from your eyes now when the singing was done one of the daughters came with the bowl desire of that kava rose in the missionary's bosom he lusted for it like a swimmer for the land or a bridegroom for his bride and he reached out his hand and took the bowl and would have drunk and then he remembered and put it back drink sang the daughter of miru there is no kava like the kava of the dead and to drink of it once is the reward of living i thank you it smells excellent said the missionary but i am a blue ribbon man myself and though i am aware there is a difference of opinion even in our own confession i have always held kava to be excluded what cried the convert are you going to respect a taboo at a time like this and you were always so opposed to taboos when you were alive to other people's said the missionary never to my own but yours have all proved wrong said the convert it looks like it said the missionary and i can't help that no reason why i should break my word i never heard the like of this cried the daughter of miru pray what do you expect to gain that is not the point said the missionary i took this pledge for others i am not going to break it for myself the daughter of miru was puzzled she came and told her mother and miru was vexed and they went and told akaanga i don't know what to do about this said akaanga and he came and reasoned with the missionary but there _is_ such a thing as right and wrong said the missionary and your ovens cannot alter that give the kava to the rest said akaanga to the daughters of miru i must get rid of this sea lawyer instantly or worse will come of it the next moment the missionary came up in the midst of the sea and there before him were the palm trees of the island he swam to the shore gladly and landed much matter of thought was in that missionary's mind i seem to have been misinformed upon some points said he perhaps there is not much in it as i supposed but there is something in it after all let me be glad of that and he rang the bell for service moral the sticks break the stones crumble the eternal altars tilt and tumble sanctions and tales dislimn like mist about the amazed evangelist he stands unshook from age to youth upon one pin point of the truth xvii faith half faith and no faith at all in the ancient days there went three men upon pilgrimage one was a priest and one was a virtuous person and the third was an old rover with his axe as they went the priest spoke about the grounds of faith we find the proofs of our religion in the works of nature said he and beat his breast that is true said the virtuous person the peacock has a scrannel voice said the priest as has been laid down always in our books how cheering he cried in a voice like one that wept how comforting i require no such proofs said the virtuous person then you have no reasonable faith said the priest great is the right and shall prevail cried the virtuous person there is loyalty in my soul be sure there is loyalty in the mind of odin these are but playings upon words returned the priest a sackful of such trash is nothing to the peacock just then they passed a country farm where there was a peacock seated on a rail and the bird opened its mouth and sang with the voice of a nightingale where are you now asked the virtuous person and yet this shakes not me great is the truth and shall prevail the devil fly away with that peacock said the priest and he was downcast for a mile or two but presently they came to a shrine where a fakeer performed miracles ah said the priest here are the true grounds of faith the peacock was but an adminicle this is the base of our religion and he beat upon his breast and groaned like one with colic now to me said the virtuous person all this is as little to the purpose as the peacock i believe because i see the right is great and must prevail and this fakeer might carry on with his conjuring tricks till doomsday and it would not play bluff upon a man like me now at this the fakeer was so much incensed that his hand trembled and lo in the midst of a miracle the cards fell from up his sleeve where are you now asked the virtuous person and yet it shakes not me the devil fly away with the fakeer cried the priest i really do not see the good of going on with this pilgrimage cheer up cried the virtuous person great is the right and shall prevail if you are quite sure it will prevail says the priest i pledge my word for that said the virtuous person so the other began to go on again with a better heart at last one came running and told them all was lost that the powers of darkness had besieged the heavenly mansions that odin was to die and evil triumph i have been grossly deceived cried the virtuous person all is lost now said the priest i wonder if it is too late to make it up with the devil said the virtuous person oh i hope not said the priest and at any rate we can but try but what are you doing with your axe says he to the rover i am off to die with odin said the rover xviii the touchstone the king was a man that stood well before the world his smile was sweet as clover but his soul withinsides was as little as a pea he had two sons and the younger son was a boy after his heart but the elder was one whom he feared it befell one morning that the drum sounded in the dun before it was yet day and the king rode with his two sons and a brave array behind them they rode two hours and came to the foot of a brown mountain that was very steep where do we ride said the elder son across this brown mountain said the king and smiled to himself my father knows what he is doing said the younger son and they rode two hours more and came to the sides of a black river that was wondrous deep and where do we ride asked the elder son over this black river said the king and smiled to himself my father knows what he is doing said the younger son and they rode all that day and about the time of the sunsetting came to the side of a lake where was a great dun it is here we ride said the king to a king's house and a priest's and a house where you will learn much at the gates of the dun the king who was a priest met them and he was a grave man and beside him stood his daughter and she was as fair as the morn and one that smiled and looked down these are my two sons said the first king and here is my daughter said the king who was a priest she is a wonderful fine maid said the first king and i like her manner of smiling they are wonderful well grown lads said the second and i like their gravity and then the two kings looked at each other and said the thing may come about and in the meanwhile the two lads looked upon the maid and the one grew pale and the other red and the maid looked upon the ground smiling here is the maid that i shall marry said the elder for i think she smiled upon me but the younger plucked his father by the sleeve father said he a word in your ear if i find favour in your sight might not i wed this maid for i think she smiles upon me a word in yours said the king his father waiting is good hunting and when the teeth are shut the tongue is at home now they were come into the dun and feasted and this was a great house so that the lads were astonished and the king that was a priest sat at the end of the board and was silent so that the lads were filled with reverence and the maid served them smiling with downcast eyes so that their hearts were enlarged before it was day the elder son arose and he found the maid at her weaving for she was a diligent girl maid quoth he i would fain marry you you must speak with my father said she and she looked upon the ground smiling and became like the rose her heart is with me said the elder son and he went down to the lake and sang a little after came the younger son maid quoth he if our fathers were agreed i would like well to marry you you can speak to my father said she and looked upon the ground and smiled and grew like the rose she is a dutiful daughter said the younger son she will make an obedient wife and then he thought what shall i do and he remembered the king her father was a priest so he went into the temple and sacrificed a weasel and a hare presently the news got about and the two lads and the first king were called into the presence of the king who was a priest where he sat upon the high seat little i reck of gear said the king who was a priest and little of power for we live here among the shadow of things and the heart is sick of seeing them and we stay here in the wind like raiment drying and the heart is weary of the wind but one thing i love and that is truth and for one thing will i give my daughter and that is the trial stone for in the light of that stone the seeming goes and the being shows and all things besides are worthless therefore lads if ye would wed my daughter out foot and bring me the stone of touch for that is the price of her a word in your ear said the younger son to his father i think we do very well without this stone a word in yours said the father i am of your way of thinking but when the teeth are shut the tongue is at home and he smiled to the king that was a priest but the elder son got to his feet and called the king that was a priest by the name of father for whether i marry the maid or no i will call you by that word for the love of your wisdom and even now i will ride forth and search the world for the stone of touch so he said farewell and rode into the world i think i will go too said the younger son if i can have your leave for my heart goes out to the maid you will ride home with me said his father so they rode home and when they came to the dun the king had his son into his treasury here said he is the touchstone which shows truth for there is no truth but plain truth and if you will look in this you will see yourself as you are and the younger son looked in it and saw his face as it were the face of a beardless youth and he was well enough pleased for the thing was a piece of a mirror here is no such great thing to make a work about said he but if it will get me the maid i shall never complain but what a fool is my brother to ride into the world and the thing all the while at home so they rode back to the other dun and showed the mirror to the king that was a priest and when he had looked in it and seen himself like a king and his house like a king's house and all things like themselves he cried out and blessed god for now i know said he there is no truth but the plain truth and i am a king indeed although my heart misgave me and he pulled down his temple and built a new one and then the younger son was married to the maid in the meantime the elder son rode into the world to find the touchstone of the trial of truth and whenever he came to a place of habitation he would ask the men if they had heard of it and in every place the men answered not only have we heard of it but we alone of all men possess the thing itself and it hangs in the side of our chimney to this day then would the elder son be glad and beg for a sight of it and sometimes it would be a piece of mirror that showed the seeming of things and then he would say this can never be for there should be more than seeming and sometimes it would be a lump of coal which showed nothing and then he would say this can never be for at least there is the seeming and sometimes it would be a touchstone indeed beautiful in hue adorned with polishing the light inhabiting its sides and when he found this he would beg the thing and the persons of that place would give it him for all men were very generous of that gift so that at the last he had his wallet full of them and they chinked together when he rode and when he halted by the side of the way he would take them out and try them till his head turned like the sails upon a windmill a murrain upon this business said the elder son for i perceive no end to it here i have the red and here the blue and the green and to me they seem all excellent and yet shame each other a murrain on the trade if it were not for the king that is a priest and whom i have called my father and if it were not for the fair maid of the dun that makes my mouth to sing and my heart enlarge i would even tumble them all into the salt sea and go home and be a king like other folk but he was like the hunter that has seen a stag upon a mountain so that the night may fall and the fire be kindled and the lights shine in his house but desire of that stag is single in his bosom now after many years the elder son came upon the sides of the salt sea and it was night and a savage place and the clamour of the sea was loud there he was aware of a house and a man that sat there by the light of a candle for he had no fire now the elder son came in to him and the man gave him water to drink for he had no bread and wagged his head when he was spoken to
