"1" "because he turned back a pace or two a cold white light lingered in the western sky the man leaned over the gate in an interested manner you must be captain hagberd he said with easy assurance the old man spun round pulling out his spade startled by the strange voice yes i am he answered nervously the other smiling straight at him uttered very slowly you've been advertising for your son i believe my son harry mumbled captain hagberd off his guard for once he's coming home tomorrow the devil he is the stranger marvelled greatly and then went on with only a slight change of tone you've grown a beard like father christmas himself captain hagberd drew a little nearer and leaned forward over his spade go your way he said resentfully and timidly at the same time because he was always afraid of being laughed at every mental state even madness has its equilibrium based upon self esteem its disturbance causes unhappiness and captain hagberd lived amongst a scheme of settled notions which it pained him to feel disturbed by people's grins yes people's grins were awful they hinted at something wrong but what he could not tell and that stranger was obviously grinning had come on purpose to grin it was bad enough on the streets but he had never before been outraged like this the stranger unaware how near he was of having his head laid open with a spade said seriously i am not trespassing where i stand am i i fancy there's something wrong about your news suppose you let me come in _you_ come in murmured old hagberd with inexpressible horror i could give you some real information about your son the very latest tip if you care to hear no shouted hagberd he began to pace wildly to and fro he shouldered his spade he gesticulated with his other arm here's a fellow a grinning fellow who says there's something wrong i've got more information than you're aware of i've all the information i want i've had it for years for years for years enough to last me till to morrow let you come in indeed what would harry say bessie carvil's figure appeared in black silhouette on the parlour window then with the sound of an opening door flitted out before the other cottage all black but with something white over her head these two voices beginning to talk suddenly outside she had heard them indoors had given her such an emotion that she could not utter a sound captain hagberd seemed to be trying to find his way out of a cage his feet squelched in the puddles left by his industry he stumbled in the holes of the ruined grass plot he ran blindly against the fence here steady a bit said the man at the gate gravely stretching his arm over and catching him by the sleeve somebody's been trying to get at you hallo what's this rig you've got on storm canvas by george he had a big laugh well you _are_ a character captain hagberd jerked himself free and began to back away shrinkingly for the present he muttered in a crestfallen tone what's the matter with him the stranger addressed bessie with the utmost familiarity in a deliberate explanatory tone i didn't want to startle the old man he lowered his voice as though he had known her for years i dropped into a barber's on my way to get a twopenny shave and they told me there he was something of a character the old man has been a character all his life captain hagberd daunted by the allusion to his clothing had retreated inside taking his spade with him and the two at the gate startled by the unexpected slamming of the door heard the bolts being shot the snapping of the lock and the echo of an affected gurgling laugh within i didn't want to upset him the man said after a short silence what's the meaning of all this he isn't quite crazy he has been worrying a long time about his lost son said bessie in a low apologetic tone well i am his son harry she cried and was profoundly silent know my name friends with the old man eh he's our landlord bessie faltered out catching hold of the iron railing owns both them rabbit hutches does he commented young hagberd scornfully just the thing he would be proud of can you tell me who's that chap coming to morrow you must know something of it i tell you it's a swindle on the old man nothing else she did not answer helpless before an insurmountable difficulty appalled before the necessity the impossibility and the dread of an explanation in which she and madness seemed involved together oh i am so sorry she murmured what's the matter he said with serenity you needn't be afraid of upsetting me it's the other fellow that'll be upset when he least expects it i don't care a hang but there will be some fun when he shows his mug to morrow i don't care _that_ for the old man's pieces but right is right you shall see me put a head on that coon whoever he is he had come nearer and towered above her on the other side of the railings he glanced at her hands he fancied she was trembling and it occurred to him that she had her part perhaps in that little game that was to be sprung on his old man to morrow he had come just in time to spoil their sport he was entertained by the idea scornful of the baffled plot but all his life he had been full of indulgence for all sorts of women's tricks she really was trembling very much her wrap had slipped off her head poor devil he thought never mind about that chap i daresay he'll change his mind before to morrow but what about me i can't loaf about the gate til the morning she burst out it is _you_ you yourself that he's waiting for it is _you_ who come to morrow he murmured oh it's me blankly and they seemed to become breathless together apparently he was pondering over what he had heard then without irritation but evidently perplexed he said i don't understand i hadn't written or anything it's my chum who saw the paper and told me this very morning eh what he bent his ear she whispered rapidly and he listened for a while muttering the words yes and i see at times then but why won't today do he queried at last you didn't understand me she exclaimed impatiently the clear streak of light under the clouds died out in the west again he stooped slightly to hear better and the deep night buried everything of the whispering woman and the attentive man except the familiar contiguity of their faces with its air of secrecy and caress he squared his shoulders the broad brimmed shadow of a hat sat cavalierly on his head awkward this eh he appealed to her to morrow well well never heard tell of anything like this it's all to morrow then without any sort of to day as far as i can see she remained still and mute and you have been encouraging this funny notion he said i never contradicted him why didn't you what for should i she defended herself it would only have made him miserable he would have gone out of his mind his mind he muttered and heard a short nervous laugh from her where was the harm was i to quarrel with the poor old man it was easier to half believe it myself aye aye he meditated intelligently i suppose the old chap got around you somehow with his soft talk you are good hearted her hands moved up in the dark nervously and it might have been true it was true it has come here it is this is the to morrow we have been waiting for she drew a breath and he said good humouredly aye with the door shut i wouldn't care if and you think he could be brought round to recognise me eh what you could do it in a week you say h'm i daresay you could but do you think i could hold out a week in this dead alive place not me i want either hard work or an all fired racket or more space than there is in the whole of england i have been in this place though once before and for more than a week the old man was advertising for me then and a chum i had with me had a notion of getting a couple quid out of him by writing a lot of silly nonsense in a letter that lark did not come off though we had to clear out and none too soon but this time i've a chum waiting for me in london and besides bessie carvil was breathing quickly what if i tried a knock at the door he suggested try she said captain hagberd's gate squeaked and the shadow of the son moved on then stopped with another deep laugh in the throat like the father's only soft and gentle thrilling to the woman's heart awakening to her ears he isn't frisky is he i would be afraid to lay hold of him the chaps are always telling me i don't know my own strength he's the most harmless creature that ever lived she interrupted you wouldn't say so if you had seen him chasing me upstairs with a hard leather strap he said i haven't forgotten it in sixteen years she got warm from head to foot under another soft subdued laugh at the rat tat tat of the knocker her heart flew into her mouth hey dad let me in i am harry i am straight come back home a day too soon one of the windows upstairs ran up a grinning information fellow said the voice of old hagberd up in the darkness don't you have anything to do with him it will spoil everything she heard harry hagberd say hallo dad then a clanging clatter the window rumbled down and he stood before her again it's just like old times nearly walloped the life out of me to stop me going away and now i come back he throws a confounded shovel at my head to keep me out it grazed my shoulder she shuddered i wouldn't care he began only i spent my last shillings on the railway fare and my last twopence on a shave out of respect for the old man are you really harry hagberd she asked can you prove it can i prove it can any one else prove it he said jovially prove with what what do i want to prove there isn't a single corner in the world barring england perhaps where you could not find some man or more likely woman that would remember me for harry hagberd i am more like harry hagberd than any man alive and i can prove it to you in a minute if you will let me step inside your gate come in she said he entered then the front garden of the carvils his tall shadow strode with a swagger she turned her back on the window and waited watching the shape of which the footfalls seemed the most material part the light fell on a tilted hat a powerful shoulder that seemed to cleave the darkness on a leg stepping out he swung about and stood still facing the illuminated parlour window at her back turning his head from side to side laughing softly to himself just fancy for a minute the old man's beard stuck on to my chin hey now say i was the very spit of him from a boy it's true she murmured to herself and that's about as far as it goes he was always one of your domestic characters why i remember how he used to go about looking very sick for three days before he had to leave home on one of his trips to south shields for coal he had a standing charter from the gas works you would think he was off on a whaling cruise three years and a tail ha ha not a bit of it ten days on the outside the skimmer of the seas was a smart craft fine name wasn't it mother's uncle owned her he interrupted himself and in a lowered voice did he ever tell you what mother died of he asked yes said miss bessie bitterly from impatience he made no sound for a while then brusquely they were so afraid i would turn out badly that they fairly drove me away mother nagged at me for being idle and the old man said he would cut my soul out of my body rather than let me go to sea well it looked as if he would do it too so i went it looks to me sometimes as if i had been born to them by a mistake in that other hutch of a house where ought you to have been born by rights bessie carvil interrupted him defiantly in the open upon a beach on a windy night he said quick as lightning then he mused slowly they were characters both of them by george and the old man keeps it up well don't he a damned shovel on the hark who's that making that row bessie bessie it's in your house it's for me she said with indifference he stepped aside out of the streak of light your husband he inquired with the tone of a man accustomed to unlawful trysts fine voice for a ship's deck in a thundering squall no my father i am not married you seem a fine girl miss bessie dear he said at once she turned her face away oh i say what's up who's murdering him he wants his tea she faced him still and tall with averted head with her hands hanging clasped before her hadn't you better go in he suggested after watching for a while the nape of her neck a patch of dazzling white skin and soft shadow above the sombre line of her shoulders her wrap had slipped down to her elbows you'll have all the town coming out presently i'll wait here a bit her wrap fell to the ground and he stooped to pick it up she had vanished he threw it over his arm and approaching the window squarely he saw a monstrous form of a fat man in an armchair an unshaded lamp the yawning of an enormous mouth in a big flat face encircled by a ragged halo of hair miss bessie's head and bust the shouting stopped the blind ran down he lost himself in thinking how awkward it was father mad no getting into the house no money to get back a hungry chum in london who would begin to think he had been given the go by damn he muttered he could break the door in certainly but they would perhaps bundle him into chokey for that without asking questions no great matter only he was confoundedly afraid of being locked up even in mistake he turned cold at the thought he stamped his feet on the sodden grass what are you a sailor said an agitated voice she had flitted out a shadow herself attracted by the reckless shadow waiting under the wall of her home anything enough of a sailor to be worth my salt before the mast came home that way this time where do you come from she asked right away from a jolly good spree he said by the london train see ough i hate being shut up in a train i don't mind a house so much ah she said that's lucky because in a house you can at any time open the blamed door and walk away straight before you and never come back not for sixteen years at least he laughed to a rabbit hutch and get a confounded old shovel a ship is not so very big she taunted no but the sea is great she dropped her head and as if her ears had been opened to the voices of the world she heard beyond the rampart of sea wall the swell of yesterday's gale breaking on the beach with monotonous and solemn vibrations as if all the earth had been a tolling bell and then why a ship's a ship you love her and leave her and a voyage isn't a marriage he quoted the sailor's saying lightly it is not a marriage she whispered i never took a false name and i've never yet told a lie to a woman what lie why _the_ lie take me or leave me i say and if you take me then it is he hummed a snatch very low leaning against the wall oh ho ho rio and fare thee well my bonnie young girl we're bound to rio grande capstan song he explained her teeth chattered you are cold he said here's that affair of yours i picked up she felt his hands about her wrapping her closely hold the ends together in front he commanded what did you come here for she asked repressing a shudder five quid he answered promptly we let our spree go on a little too long and got hard up you've been drinking she said blind three days on purpose i am not given that way don't you think there's nothing and nobody that can get over me unless i like i can be as steady as a rock my chum sees the paper this morning and says he to me go on harry loving parent that's five quid sure so we scraped all our pockets for the fare devil of a lark you have a hard heart i am afraid she sighed what for for running away why he wanted to make a lawyer's clerk of me just to please himself master in his own house and my poor mother egged him on for my good i suppose well then so long and i went no i tell you the day i cleared out i was all black and blue from his great fondness for me ah he was always a bit of a character look at that shovel now off his chump not much that's just exactly like my dad he wants me here just to have somebody to order about however we two were hard up and what's five quid to him once in sixteen hard years oh but i am sorry for you did you never want to come back home be a lawyer's clerk and rot here in some such place as this he cried in contempt what if the old man set me up in a home to day i would kick it down about my ears or else die there before the third day was out and where else is it that you hope to die in the bush somewhere in the sea on a blamed mountain top for choice at home yes the world's my home but i expect i'll die in a hospital some day what of that any place is good enough as long as i've lived and i've been everything you can think of almost but a tailor or a soldier i've been a boundary rider i've sheared sheep and humped my swag and harpooned a whale i've rigged ships and prospected for gold and skinned dead bullocks and turned my back on more money than the old man would have scraped in his whole life ha ha he overwhelmed her she pulled herself together and managed to utter time to rest now he straightened himself up away from the wall and in a severe voice said time to go but he did not move he leaned back again and hummed thoughtfully a bar or two of an outlandish tune she felt as if she were about to cry that's another of your cruel songs she said learned it in mexico in sonora he talked easily it is the song of the gambucinos you don't know the song of restless men nothing could hold them in one place not even a woman you used to meet one of them now and again in the old days on the edge of the gold country away north there beyond the rio gila i've seen it a prospecting engineer in mazatlan took me along with him to help look after the waggons a sailor's a handy chap to have about you anyhow it's all a desert cracks in the earth that you can't see the bottom of and mountains sheer rocks standing up high like walls and church spires only a hundred times bigger the valleys are full of boulders and black stones there's not a blade of grass to see and the sun sets more red over that country than i have seen it anywhere blood red and angry it _is_ fine you do not want to go back there again she stammered out he laughed a little no that's the blamed gold country it gave me the shivers sometimes to look at it and we were a big lot of men together mind but these gambucinos wandered alone they knew that country before anybody had ever heard of it they had a sort of gift for prospecting and the fever of it was on them too and they did not seem to want the gold very much they would find some rich spot and then turn their backs on it pick up perhaps a little enough for a spree and then be off again looking for more they never stopped long where there were houses they had no wife no chick no home never a chum you couldn't be friends with a gambucino they were too restless here to day and gone god knows where to morrow they told no one of their finds and there has never been a gambucino well off it was not for the gold they cared it was the wandering about looking for it in the stony country that got into them and wouldn't let them rest so that no woman yet born could hold a gambucino for more than a week that's what the song says it's all about a pretty girl that tried hard to keep hold of a gambucino lover so that he should bring her lots of gold no fear off he went and she never saw him again what became of her she breathed out the song don't tell cried a bit i daresay they were the fellows kiss and go but it's the looking for a thing a something sometimes i think i am a sort of gambucino myself no woman can hold you then she began in a brazen voice which quavered suddenly before the end no longer than a week he joked playing upon her very heartstrings with the gay tender note of his laugh and yet i am fond of them all anything for a woman of the right sort the scrapes they got me into and the scrapes they got me out of i love them at first sight i've fallen in love with you already miss bessie's your name eh she backed away a little and with a trembling laugh you haven't seen my face yet he bent forward gallantly a little pale it suits some but you are a fine figure of a girl miss bessie she was all in a flutter nobody had ever said so much to her before his tone changed i am getting middling hungry though had no breakfast to day couldn't you scare up some bread from that tea for me or she was gone already he had been on the point of asking her to let him come inside no matter anywhere would do devil of a fix what would his chum think i didn't ask you as a beggar he said jestingly taking a piece of bread and butter from the plate she held before him i asked as a friend my dad is rich you know he starves himself for your sake and i have starved for his whim he said taking up another piece all he has in the world is for you she pleaded yes if i come here to sit on it like a dam toad in a hole thank you and what about the shovel eh he always had a queer way of showing his love i could bring him round in a week she suggested timidly he was too hungry to answer her and holding the plate submissively to his hand she began to whisper up to him in a quick panting voice he listened amazed eating slower and slower till at last his jaws stopped altogether that's his game is it he said in a rising tone of scathing contempt an ungovernable movement of his arm sent the plate flying out of her fingers he shot out a violent curse she shrank from him putting her hand against the wall no he raged he expects expects _me_ for his rotten money who wants his home mad not he don't you think he wants his own way he wanted to turn me into a miserable lawyer's clerk and now he wants to make of me a blamed tame rabbit in a cage of me of me his subdued angry laugh frightened her now the whole world ain't a bit too big for me to spread my elbows in i can tell you what's your name bessie let alone a dam parlour in a hutch marry he wants me to marry and settle and as likely as not he has looked out the girl too dash my soul and do you know the judy may i ask she shook all over with noiseless dry sobs but he was fuming and fretting too much to notice her distress he bit his thumb with rage at the mere idea a window rattled up a grinning information fellow pronounced old hagberd dogmatically in measured tones and the sound of his voice seemed to bessie to make the night itself mad to pour insanity and disaster on the earth now i know what's wrong with the people here my dear why of course with this mad chap going about don't you have anything to do with him bessie bessie i say they stood as if dumb the old man fidgeted and mumbled to himself at the window suddenly he cried piercingly bessie i see you i'll tell harry she made a movement as if to run away but stopped and raised her hands to her temples young hagberd shadowy and big stirred no more than a man of bronze over their heads the crazy night whimpered and scolded in an old man's voice send him away my dear he's only a vagabond what you want is a good home of your own that chap has no home he's not like harry he can't be harry harry is coming to morrow do you hear one day more he babbled more excitedly never you fear harry shall marry you his voice rose very shrill and mad against the regular deep soughing of the swell coiling heavily about the outer face of the sea wall he will have to i shall make him or if not he swore a great oath i'll cut him off with a shilling to morrow and leave everything to you i shall to you let him starve the window rattled down harry drew a deep breath and took one step toward bessie so it's you the girl he said in a lowered voice she had not moved and she remained half turned away from him pressing her head in the palms of her hands my word he continued with an invisible half smile on his lips i have a great mind to stop her elbows were trembling violently for a week he finished without a pause she clapped her hands to her face he came up quite close and took hold of her wrists gently she felt his breath on her ear it's a scrape i am in this and it is you that must see me through he was trying to uncover her face she resisted he let her go then and stepping back a little have you got any money he asked i must be off now she nodded quickly her shamefaced head and he waited looking away from her while trembling all over and bowing her neck she tried to find the pocket of her dress here it is she whispered oh go away go away for god's sake if i had more more i would give it all to forget to make you forget he extended his hand no fear i haven't forgotten a single one of you in the world some gave me more than money but i am a beggar now and you women always had to get me out of my scrapes he swaggered up to the parlour window and in the dim light filtering through the blind looked at the coin lying in his palm it was a half sovereign he slipped it into his pocket she stood a little on one side with her head drooping as if wounded with her arms hanging passive by her side as if dead you can't buy me in he said and"
