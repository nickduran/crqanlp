guildhall it happened that as he sat that evening all alone in his counting house looking over the bill of fare for next day and checking off the fat capons in fifties and the turtle soup by the hundred quarts for his private amusement it happened that as he sat alone occupied in these pleasant calculations a strange man came in and asked him how he did adding if i am half as much changed as you sir you have no recollection of me i am sure the strange man was not over and above well dressed and was very far from being fat or rich looking in any sense of the word yet he spoke with a kind of modest confidence and assumed an easy gentlemanly sort of an air to which nobody but a rich man can lawfully presume besides this he interrupted the good citizen just as he had reckoned three hundred and seventy two fat capons and was carrying them over to the next column and as if that were not aggravation enough the learned recorder for the city of london had only ten minutes previously gone out at that very same door and had turned round and said good night my lord yes he had said my lord he a man of birth and education of the honourable society of the middle temple barrister at law he who had an uncle in the house of commons and an aunt almost but not quite in the house of lords for she had married a feeble peer and made him vote as she liked he this man this learned recorder had said my lord i’ll not wait till to morrow to give you your title my lord mayor says he with a bow and a smile you are lord mayor _de facto_ if not _de jure_ good night my lord the lord mayor elect thought of this and turning to the stranger and sternly bidding him go out of his private counting house brought forward the three hundred and seventy two fat capons and went on with his account do you remember said the other stepping forward _do_ you remember little joe toddyhigh the port wine fled for a moment from the fruiterer’s nose as he muttered joe toddyhigh what about joe toddyhigh _i_ am joe toddyhigh cried the visitor look at me look hard at me harder harder you know me now you know little joe again what a happiness to us both to meet the very night before your grandeur o give me your hand jack both hands both for the sake of old times you pinch me sir you’re a hurting of me said the lord mayor elect pettishly don’t suppose anybody should come mr toddyhigh sir mr toddyhigh repeated the other ruefully o don’t bother said the lord mayor elect scratching his head dear me why i thought you was dead what a fellow you are indeed it was a pretty state of things and worthy the tone of vexation and disappointment in which the lord mayor spoke joe toddyhigh had been a poor boy with him at hull and had oftentimes divided his last penny and parted his last crust to relieve his wants for though joe was a destitute child in those times he was as faithful and affectionate in his friendship as ever man of might could be they parted one day to seek their fortunes in different directions joe went to sea and the now wealthy citizen begged his way to london they separated with many tears like foolish fellows as they were and agreed to remain fast friends and if they lived soon to communicate again when he was an errand boy and even in the early days of his apprenticeship the citizen had many a time trudged to the post office to ask if there were any letter from poor little joe and had gone home again with tears in his eyes when he found no news of his only friend the world is a wide place and it was a long time before the letter came when it did the writer was forgotten it turned from white to yellow from lying in the post office with nobody to claim it and in course of time was torn up with five hundred others and sold for waste paper and now at last and when it might least have been expected here was this joe toddyhigh turning up and claiming acquaintance with a great public character who on the morrow would be cracking jokes with the prime minister of england and who had only at any time during the next twelve months to say the word and he could shut up temple bar and make it no thoroughfare for the king himself i am sure i don’t know what to say mr toddyhigh said the lord mayor elect i really don’t it’s very inconvenient i’d sooner have given twenty pound it’s very inconvenient really a thought had come into his mind that perhaps his old friend might say something passionate which would give him an excuse for being angry himself no such thing joe looked at him steadily but very mildly and did not open his lips of course i shall pay you what i owe you said the lord mayor elect fidgeting in his chair you lent me i think it was a shilling or some small coin when we parted company and that of course i shall pay with good interest i can pay my way with any man and always have done if you look into the mansion house the day after to morrow some time after dusk and ask for my private clerk you’ll find he has a draft for you i haven’t got time to say anything more just now unless he hesitated for coupled with a strong desire to glitter for once in all his glory in the eyes of his former companion was a distrust of his appearance which might be more shabby than he could tell by that feeble light unless you’d like to come to the dinner to morrow i don’t mind your having this ticket if you like to take it a great many people would give their ears for it i can tell you his old friend took the card without speaking a word and instantly departed his sunburnt face and gray hair were present to the citizen’s mind for a moment but by the time he reached three hundred and eighty one fat capons he had quite forgotten him joe toddyhigh had never been in the capital of europe before and he wandered up and down the streets that night amazed at the number of churches and other public buildings the splendour of the shops the riches that were heaped up on every side the glare of light in which they were displayed and the concourse of people who hurried to and fro indifferent apparently to all the wonders that surrounded them but in all the long streets and broad squares there were none but strangers it was quite a relief to turn down a by way and hear his own footsteps on the pavement he went home to his inn thought that london was a dreary desolate place and felt disposed to doubt the existence of one true hearted man in the whole worshipful company of patten makers finally he went to bed and dreamed that he and the lord mayor elect were boys again he went next day to the dinner and when in a burst of light and music and in the midst of splendid decorations and surrounded by brilliant company his former friend appeared at the head of the hall and was hailed with shouts and cheering he cheered and shouted with the best and for the moment could have cried the next moment he cursed his weakness in behalf of a man so changed and selfish and quite hated a jolly looking old gentleman opposite for declaring himself in the pride of his heart a patten maker as the banquet proceeded he took more and more to heart the rich citizen’s unkindness and that not from any envy but because he felt that a man of his state and fortune could all the better afford to recognise an old friend even if he were poor and obscure the more he thought of this the more lonely and sad he felt when the company dispersed and adjourned to the ball room he paced the hall and passages alone ruminating in a very melancholy condition upon the disappointment he had experienced it chanced while he was lounging about in this moody state that he stumbled upon a flight of stairs dark steep and narrow which he ascended without any thought about the matter and so came into a little music gallery empty and deserted from this elevated post which commanded the whole hall he amused himself in looking down upon the attendants who were clearing away the fragments of the feast very lazily and drinking out of all the bottles and glasses with most commendable perseverance his attention gradually relaxed and he fell fast asleep when he awoke he thought there must be something the matter with his eyes but rubbing them a little he soon found that the moonlight was really streaming through the east window that the lamps were all extinguished and that he was alone he listened but no distant murmur in the echoing passages not even the shutting of a door broke the deep silence he groped his way down the stairs and found that the door at the bottom was locked on the other side he began now to comprehend that he must have slept a long time that he had been overlooked and was shut up there for the night his first sensation perhaps was not altogether a comfortable one for it was a dark chilly earthy smelling place and something too large for a man so situated to feel at home in however when the momentary consternation of his surprise was over he made light of the accident and resolved to feel his way up the stairs again and make himself as comfortable as he could in the gallery until morning as he turned to execute this purpose he heard the clocks strike three any such invasion of a dead stillness as the striking of distant clocks causes it to appear the more intense and insupportable when the sound has ceased he listened with strained attention in the hope that some clock lagging behind its fellows had yet to strike looking all the time into the profound darkness before him until it seemed to weave itself into a black tissue patterned with a hundred reflections of his own eyes but the bells had all pealed out their warning for that once and the gust of wind that moaned through the place seemed cold and heavy with their iron breath the time and circumstances were favourable to reflection he tried to keep his thoughts to the current unpleasant though it was in which they had moved all day and to think with what a romantic feeling he had looked forward to shaking his old friend by the hand before he died and what a wide and cruel difference there was between the meeting they had had and that which he had so often and so long anticipated still he was disordered by waking to such sudden loneliness and could not prevent his mind from running upon odd tales of people of undoubted courage who being shut up by night in vaults or churches or other dismal places had scaled great heights to get out and fled from silence as they had never done from danger this brought to his mind the moonlight through the window and bethinking himself of it he groped his way back up the crooked stairs but very stealthily as though he were fearful of being overheard he was very much astonished when he approached the gallery again to see a light in the building still more so on advancing hastily and looking round to observe no visible source from which it could proceed but how much greater yet was his astonishment at the spectacle which this light revealed the statues of the two giants gog and magog each above fourteen feet in height those which succeeded to still older and more barbarous figures after the great fire of london and which stand in the guildhall to this day were endowed with life and motion these guardian genii of the city had quitted their pedestals and reclined in easy attitudes in the great stained glass window between them was an ancient cask which seemed to be full of wine for the younger giant clapping his huge hand upon it and throwing up his mighty leg burst into an exulting laugh which reverberated through the hall like thunder joe toddyhigh instinctively stooped down and more dead than alive felt his hair stand on end his knees knock together and a cold damp break out upon his forehead but even at that minute curiosity prevailed over every other feeling and somewhat reassured by the good humour of the giants and their apparent unconsciousness of his presence he crouched in a corner of the gallery in as small a space as he could and peeping between the rails observed them closely it was then that the elder giant who had a flowing gray beard raised his thoughtful eyes to his companion’s face and in a grave and solemn voice addressed him thus first night of the giant chronicles turning towards his companion the elder giant uttered these words in a grave majestic tone magog does boisterous mirth beseem the giant warder of this ancient city is this becoming demeanour for a watchful spirit over whose bodiless head so many years have rolled so many changes swept like empty air in whose impalpable nostrils the scent of blood and crime pestilence cruelty and horror has been familiar as breath to mortals in whose sight time has gathered in the harvest of centuries and garnered so many crops of human pride affections hopes and sorrows bethink you of our compact the night wanes feasting revelry and music have encroached upon our usual hours of solitude and morning will be here apace ere we are stricken mute again bethink you of our compact pronouncing these latter words with more of impatience than quite accorded with his apparent age and gravity the giant raised a long pole which he still bears in his hand and tapped his brother giant rather smartly on the head indeed the blow was so smartly administered that the latter quickly withdrew his lips from the cask to which they had been applied and catching up his shield and halberd assumed an attitude of defence his irritation was but momentary for he laid these weapons aside as hastily as he had assumed them and said as he did so you know gog old friend that when we animate these shapes which the londoners of old assigned and not unworthily to the guardian genii of their city we are susceptible of some of the sensations which belong to human kind thus when i taste wine i feel blows when i relish the one i disrelish the other therefore gog the more especially as your arm is none of the lightest keep your good staff by your side else we may chance to differ peace be between us amen said the other leaning his staff in the window corner why did you laugh just now to think replied the giant magog laying his hand upon the cask of him who owned this wine and kept it in a cellar hoarded from the light of day for thirty years till it should be fit to drink quoth he he was twoscore and ten years old when he buried it beneath his house and yet never thought that he might be scarcely fit to drink when the wine became so i wonder it never occurred to him to make himself unfit to be eaten there is very little of him left by this time picture gog and magog the night is waning said gog mournfully i know it replied his companion and i see you are impatient but look through the eastern window placed opposite to us that the first beams of the rising sun may every morning gild our giant faces the moon rays fall upon the pavement in a stream of light that to my fancy sinks through the cold stone and gushes into the old crypt below the night is scarcely past its noon and our great charge is sleeping heavily they ceased to speak and looked upward at the moon the sight of their large black rolling eyes filled joe toddyhigh with such horror that he could scarcely draw his breath still they took no note of him and appeared to believe themselves quite alone our compact said magog after a pause is if i understand it that instead of watching here in silence through the dreary nights we entertain each other with stories of our past experience with tales of the past the present and the future with legends of london and her sturdy citizens from the old simple times that every night at midnight when st paul’s bell tolls out one and we may move and speak we thus discourse nor leave such themes till the first gray gleam of day shall strike us dumb is that our bargain brother yes said the giant gog that is the league between us who guard this city by day in spirit and by night in body also and never on ancient holidays have its conduits run wine more merrily than we will pour forth our legendary lore we are old chroniclers from this time hence the crumbled walls encircle us once more the postern gates are closed the drawbridge is up and pent in its narrow den beneath the water foams and struggles with the sunken starlings jerkins and quarter staves are in the streets again the nightly watch is set the rebel sad and lonely in his tower dungeon tries to sleep and weeps for home and children aloft upon the gates and walls are noble heads glaring fiercely down upon the dreaming city and vexing the hungry dogs that scent them in the air and tear the ground beneath with dismal howlings the axe the block the rack in their dark chambers give signs of recent use the thames floating past long lines of cheerful windows whence come a burst of music and a stream of light bears suddenly to the palace wall the last red stain brought on the tide from traitor’s gate but your pardon brother the night wears and i am talking idly the other giant appeared to be entirely of this opinion for during the foregoing rhapsody of his fellow sentinel he had been scratching his head with an air of comical uneasiness or rather with an air that would have been very comical if he had been a dwarf or an ordinary sized man he winked too and though it could not be doubted for a moment that he winked to himself still he certainly cocked his enormous eye towards the gallery where the listener was concealed nor was this all for he gaped and when he gaped joe was horribly reminded of the popular prejudice on the subject of giants and of their fabled power of smelling out englishmen however closely concealed his alarm was such that he nearly swooned and it was some little time before his power of sight or hearing was restored when he recovered he found that the elder giant was pressing the younger to commence the chronicles and that the latter was endeavouring to excuse himself on the ground that the night was far spent and it would be better to wait until the next well assured by this that he was certainly about to begin directly the listener collected his faculties by a great effort and distinctly heard magog express himself to the following effect in the sixteenth century and in the reign of queen elizabeth of glorious memory albeit her golden days are sadly rusted with blood there lived in the city of london a bold young prentice who loved his master’s daughter there were no doubt within the walls a great many prentices in this condition but i speak of only one and his name was hugh graham this hugh was apprenticed to an honest bowyer who dwelt in the ward of cheype and was rumoured to possess great wealth rumour was quite as infallible in those days as at the present time but it happened then as now to be sometimes right by accident it stumbled upon the truth when it gave the old bowyer a mint of money his trade had been a profitable one in the time of king henry the eighth who encouraged english archery to the utmost and he had been prudent and discreet thus it came to pass that mistress alice his only daughter was the richest heiress in all his wealthy ward young hugh had often maintained with staff and cudgel that she was the handsomest to do him justice i believe she was if he could have gained the heart of pretty mistress alice by knocking this conviction into stubborn people’s heads hugh would have had no cause to fear but though the bowyer’s daughter smiled in secret to hear of his doughty deeds for her sake and though her little waiting woman reported all her smiles and many more to hugh and though he was at a vast expense in kisses and small coin to recompense her fidelity he made no progress in his love he durst not whisper it to mistress alice save on sure encouragement and that she never gave him a glance of her dark eye as she sat at the door on a summer’s evening after prayer time while he and the neighbouring prentices exercised themselves in the street with blunted sword and buckler would fire hugh’s blood so that none could stand before him but then she glanced at others quite as kindly as on him and where was the use of cracking crowns if mistress alice smiled upon the cracked as well as on the cracker still hugh went on and loved her more and more he thought of her all day and dreamed of her all night long he treasured up her every word and gesture and had a palpitation of the heart whenever he heard her footstep on the stairs or her voice in an adjoining room to him the old bowyer’s house was haunted by an angel there was enchantment in the air and space in which she moved it would have been no miracle to hugh if flowers had sprung from the rush strewn floors beneath the tread of lovely mistress alice never did prentice long to distinguish himself in the eyes of his lady love so ardently as hugh sometimes he pictured to himself the house taking fire by night and he when all drew back in fear rushing through flame and smoke and bearing her from the ruins in his arms at other times he thought of a rising of fierce rebels an attack upon the city a strong assault upon the bowyer’s house in particular and he falling on the threshold pierced with numberless wounds in defence of mistress alice if he could only enact some prodigy of valour do some wonderful deed and let her know that she had inspired it he thought he could die contented sometimes the bowyer and his daughter would go out to supper with a worthy citizen at the fashionable hour of six o’clock and on such occasions hugh wearing his blue prentice cloak as gallantly as prentice might would attend with a lantern and his trusty club to escort them home these were the brightest moments of his life to hold the light while mistress alice picked her steps to touch her hand as he helped her over broken ways to have her leaning on his arm it sometimes even came to that this was happiness indeed when the nights were fair hugh followed in the rear his eyes riveted on the graceful figure of the bowyer’s daughter as she and the old man moved on before him so they threaded the narrow winding streets of the city now passing beneath the overhanging gables of old wooden houses whence creaking signs projected into the street and now emerging from some dark and frowning gateway into the clear moonlight at such times or when the shouts of straggling brawlers met her ear the bowyer’s daughter would look timidly back at hugh beseeching him to draw nearer and then how he grasped his club and longed to do battle with a dozen rufflers for the love of mistress alice the old bowyer was in the habit of lending money on interest to the gallants of the court and thus it happened that many a richly dressed gentleman dismounted at his door more waving plumes and gallant steeds indeed were seen at the bowyer’s house and more embroidered silks and velvets sparkled in his dark shop and darker private closet than at any merchants in the city in those times no less than in the present it would seem that the richest looking cavaliers often wanted money the most picture a gallant cavalier of these glittering clients there was one who always came alone he was nobly mounted and having no attendant gave his horse in charge to hugh while he and the bowyer were closeted within once as he sprung into the saddle mistress alice was seated at an upper window and before she could withdraw he had doffed his jewelled cap and kissed his hand hugh watched him caracoling down the street and burnt with indignation but how much deeper was the glow that reddened in his cheeks when raising his eyes to the casement he saw that alice watched the stranger too he came again and often each time arrayed more gaily than before and still the little casement showed him mistress alice at length one heavy day she fled from home it had cost her a hard struggle for all her old father’s gifts were strewn about her chamber as if she had parted from them one by one and knew that the time must come when these tokens of his love would wring her heart yet she was gone she left a letter commanding her poor father to the care of hugh and wishing he might be happier than ever he could have been with her for he deserved the love of a better and a purer heart than she had to bestow the old man’s forgiveness she said she had no power to ask but she prayed god to bless him and so ended with a blot upon the paper where her tears had fallen at first the old man’s wrath was kindled and he carried his wrong to the queen’s throne itself but there was no redress he learnt at court for his daughter had been conveyed abroad this afterwards appeared to be the truth as there came from france after an interval of several years a letter in her hand it was written in trembling characters and almost illegible little could be made out save that she often thought of home and her old dear pleasant room and that she had dreamt her father was dead and had not blessed her and that her heart was breaking the poor old bowyer lingered on never suffering hugh to quit his sight for he knew now that he had loved his daughter and that was the only link that bound him to earth it broke at length and he died bequeathing his old prentice his trade and all his wealth and solemnly charging him with his last breath to revenge his child if ever he who had worked her misery crossed his path in life again from the time of alice’s flight the tilting ground the fields the fencing school the summer evening sports knew hugh no more his spirit was dead within him he rose to great eminence and repute among the citizens but was seldom seen to smile and never mingled in their revelries or rejoicings brave humane and generous he was beloved by all he was pitied too by those who knew his story and these were so many that when he walked along the streets alone at dusk even the rude common people doffed their caps and mingled a rough air of sympathy with their respect one night in may it was her birthnight and twenty years since she had left her home hugh graham sat in the room she had hallowed in his boyish days he was now a gray haired man though still in the prime of life old thoughts had borne him company for many hours and the chamber had gradually grown quite dark when he was roused by a low knocking at the outer door he hastened down and opening it saw by the light of a lamp which he had seized upon the way a female figure crouching in the portal it hurried swiftly past him and glided up the stairs he looked for pursuers there were none in sight no not one he"
