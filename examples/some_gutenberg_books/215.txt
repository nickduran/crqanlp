"1" "he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold a chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet miserable and disconsolate he wandered about among the many tents only to find that one place was as cold as another here and there savage dogs rushed upon him but he bristled his neck hair and snarled for he was learning fast and they let him go his way unmolested finally an idea came to him he would return and see how his own team mates were making out to his astonishment they had disappeared again he wandered about through the great camp looking for them and again he returned were they in the tent no that could not be else he would not have been driven out then where could they possibly be with drooping tail and shivering body very forlorn indeed he aimlessly circled the tent suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down something wriggled under his feet he sprang back bristling and snarling fearful of the unseen and unknown but a friendly little yelp reassured him and he went back to investigate a whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils and there curled up under the snow in a snug ball lay billee he whined placatingly squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions and even ventured as a bribe for peace to lick buck's face with his warm wet tongue another lesson so that was the way they did it eh buck confidently selected a spot and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep the day had been long and arduous and he slept soundly and comfortably though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp at first he did not know where he was it had snowed during the night and he was completely buried the snow walls pressed him on every side and a great surge of fear swept through him the fear of the wild thing for the trap it was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears for he was a civilized dog an unduly civilized dog and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it the muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud ere he landed on his feet he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before a shout from francois hailed his appearance wot i say the dog driver cried to perrault dat buck for sure learn queek as anyt'ing perrault nodded gravely as courier for the canadian government bearing important despatches he was anxious to secure the best dogs and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of buck three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour making a total of nine and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the dyea canon buck was glad to be gone and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it he was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to him but still more surprising was the change wrought in dave and sol leks they were new dogs utterly transformed by the harness all passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them they were alert and active anxious that the work should go well and fiercely irritable with whatever by delay or confusion retarded that work the toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight dave was wheeler or sled dog pulling in front of him was buck then came sol leks the rest of the team was strung out ahead single file to the leader which position was filled by spitz buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol leks so that he might receive instruction apt scholar that he was they were equally apt teachers never allowing him to linger long in error and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth dave was fair and very wise he never nipped buck without cause and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it as francois's whip backed him up buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate once during a brief halt when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start both dave and solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing the resulting tangle was even worse but buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter and ere the day was done so well had he mastered his work his mates about ceased nagging him francois's whip snapped less frequently and perrault even honored buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them it was a hard day's run up the canon through sheep camp past the scales and the timber line across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep and over the great chilcoot divide which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely north they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of lake bennett where thousands of goldseekers were building boats against the break up of the ice in the spring buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled that day they made forty miles the trail being packed but the next day and for many days to follow they broke their own trail worked harder and made poorer time as a rule perrault travelled ahead of the team packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them francois guiding the sled at the gee pole sometimes exchanged places with him but not often perrault was in a hurry and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice which knowledge was indispensable for the fall ice was very thin and where there was swift water there was no ice at all day after day for days unending buck toiled in the traces always they broke camp in the dark and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them and always they pitched camp after dark eating their bit of fish and crawling to sleep into the snow buck was ravenous the pound and a half of sun dried salmon which was his ration for each day seemed to go nowhere he never had enough and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs yet the other dogs because they weighed less and were born to the life received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition he swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life a dainty eater he found that his mates finishing first robbed him of his unfinished ration there was no defending it while he was fighting off two or three it was disappearing down the throats of the others to remedy this he ate as fast as they and so greatly did hunger compel him he was not above taking what did not belong to him he watched and learned when he saw pike one of the new dogs a clever malingerer and thief slyly steal a slice of bacon when perrault's back was turned he duplicated the performance the following day getting away with the whole chunk a great uproar was raised but he was unsuspected while dub an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught was punished for buck's misdeed this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland environment it marked his adaptability his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death it marked further the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence it was all well enough in the southland under the law of love and fellowship to respect private property and personal feelings but in the northland under the law of club and fang whoso took such things into account was a fool and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper not that buck reasoned it out he was fit that was all and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life all his days no matter what the odds he had never run from a fight but the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code civilized he could have died for a moral consideration say the defence of judge miller's riding whip but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide he did not steal for joy of it but because of the clamor of his stomach he did not rob openly but stole secretly and cunningly out of respect for club and fang in short the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them his development or retrogression was rapid his muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain he achieved an internal as well as external economy he could eat anything no matter how loathsome or indigestible and once eaten the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues sight and scent became remarkably keen while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril he learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs his most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance no matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward sheltered and snug and not only did he learn by experience but instincts long dead became alive again the domesticated generations fell from him in vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down it was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap in this manner had fought forgotten ancestors they quickened the old life within him and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks they came to him without effort or discovery as though they had been his always and when on the still cold nights he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike it was his ancestors dead and dust pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him and his cadences were their cadences the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness and the cold and dark thus as token of what a puppet thing life is the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the north and because manuel was a gardener's helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself chapter iii the dominant primordial beast the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew yet it was a secret growth his newborn cunning gave him poise and control he was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease and not only did he not pick fights but he avoided them whenever possible a certain deliberateness characterized his attitude he was not prone to rashness and precipitate action and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz he betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts on the other hand possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous rival spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth he even went out of his way to bully buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of lake le barge driving snow a wind that cut like a white hot knife and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place they could hardly have fared worse at their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and perrault and francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself the tent they had discarded at dyea in order to travel light a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest so snug and warm was it that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire but when buck finished his ration and returned he found his nest occupied a warning snarl told him that the trespasser was spitz till now buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much the beast in him roared he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both and spitz particularly for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble a a ah he cried to buck gif it to heem by gar gif it to heem the dirty t'eef spitz was equally willing he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage but it was then that the unexpected happened the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future past many a weary mile of trail and toil an oath from perrault the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame and a shrill yelp of pain heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry forms starving huskies four or five score of them who had scented the camp from some indian village they had crept in while buck and spitz were fighting and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back they were crazed by the smell of the food perrault found one with head buried in the grub box his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs and the grub box was capsized on the ground on the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon the clubs fell upon them unheeded they yelped and howled under the rain of blows but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured in the meantime the astonished team dogs had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders never had buck seen such dogs it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins they were mere skeletons draped loosely in draggled hides with blazing eyes and slavered fangs but the hunger madness made them terrifying irresistible there was no opposing them the team dogs were swept back against the cliff at the first onset buck was beset by three huskies and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed the din was frightful billee was crying as usual dave and sol leks dripping blood from a score of wounds were fighting bravely side by side joe was snapping like a demon once his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky and he crunched down through the bone pike the malingerer leaped upon the crippled animal breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk buck got a frothing adversary by the throat and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular the warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness he flung himself upon another and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat it was spitz treacherously attacking from the side perrault and francois having cleaned out their part of the camp hurried to save their sled dogs the wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them and buck shook himself free but it was only for a moment the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team billee terrified into bravery sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice pike and dub followed on his heels with the rest of the team behind as buck drew himself together to spring after them out of the tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him but he braced himself to the shock of spitz's charge then joined the flight out on the lake later the nine team dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the forest though unpursued they were in a sorry plight there was not one who was not wounded in four or five places while some were wounded grievously dub was badly injured in a hind leg dolly the last husky added to the team at dyea had a badly torn throat joe had lost an eye while billee the good natured with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons cried and whimpered throughout the night at daybreak they limped warily back to camp to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers fully half their grub supply was gone the huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings in fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them they had eaten a pair of perrault's moose hide moccasins chunks out of the leather traces and even two feet of lash from the end of francois's whip he broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs ah my frien's he said softly mebbe it mek you mad dog dose many bites mebbe all mad dog sacredam wot you t'ink eh perrault the courier shook his head dubiously with four hundred miles of trail still between him and dawson he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape and the wound stiffened team was under way struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered and for that matter the hardest between them and dawson the thirty mile river was wide open its wild water defied the frost and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles and terrible they were for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man a dozen times perrault nosing the way broke through the ice bridges being saved by the long pole he carried which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body but a cold snap was on the thermometer registering fifty below zero and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments nothing daunted him it was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier he took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt once the sled broke through with dave and buck and they were half frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out the usual fire was necessary to save them they were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames at another time spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around but behind him was dave likewise straining backward and behind the sled was francois pulling till his tendons cracked again the rim ice broke away before and behind and there was no escape except up the cliff perrault scaled it by a miracle while francois prayed for just that miracle and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope the dogs were hoisted one by one to the cliff crest francois came up last after the sled and load then came the search for a place to descend which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice buck was played out the rest of the dogs were in like condition but perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early the first day they covered thirty five miles to the big salmon the next day thirty five more to the little salmon the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the five fingers buck's feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave dweller or river man all day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog hungry as he was he would not move to receive his ration of fish which francois had to bring to him also the dog driver rubbed buck's feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them later his feet grew hard to the trail and the worn out foot gear was thrown away at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad she announced her condition by a long heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for buck he had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic straight away he raced with dolly panting and frothing one leap behind nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness he plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it and all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that francois would save him the dog driver held the axe poised in his hand and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad dolly's head buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless this was spitz's opportunity he sprang upon buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone then francois's lash descended and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the teams one devil dat spitz remarked perrault some dam day heem keel dat buck dat buck two devils was francois's rejoinder all de tam i watch dat buck i know for sure lissen some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell an den heem chew dat spitz all up an spit heem out on de snow sure i know from then on it was war between them spitz as lead dog and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland dog and strange buck was to him for of the many southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail they were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation buck was the exception he alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and cunning then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery he was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come buck wanted it he wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and trace that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness this was the pride of dave as wheel dog of sol leks as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sled dogs who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness up time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible lead dog and this was buck's pride too he openly threatened the other's leadership he came between him and the shirks he should have punished and he did it deliberately one night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning pike the malingerer did not appear he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his hiding place but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between so unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in"
