"1" "historian endowed him with the romantic privilege of the first person the darkest abyss of romance this inveterately when enjoyed on the grand scale variety and many other queer matters as well might have been smuggled in by a back door suffice it to be brief that the first person in the long piece is a form foredoomed to looseness and that looseness never much my affair had never been so little so as on this particular occasion all of which reflexions flocked to the standard from the moment a very early one the question of how to keep my form amusing while sticking so close to my central figure and constantly taking its pattern from him had to be faced he arrives arrives at chester as for the dreadful purpose of giving his creator no end to tell about him before which rigorous mission the serenest of creators might well have quailed i was far from the serenest i was more than agitated enough to reflect that grimly deprived of one alternative or one substitute for telling i must address myself tooth and nail to another i couldn't save by implication make other persons tell each other about him blest resource blest necessity of the drama which reaches its effects of unity all remarkably by paths absolutely opposite to the paths of the novel with other persons save as they were primarily his persons not he primarily but one of theirs i had simply nothing to do i had relations for him none the less by the mercy of providence quite as much as if my exhibition was to be a muddle if i could only by implication and a show of consequence make other persons tell each other about him i could at least make him tell them whatever in the world he must and could so by the same token which was a further luxury thrown in see straight into the deep differences between what that could do for me or at all events for him and the large ease of autobiography it may be asked why if one so keeps to one's hero one shouldn't make a single mouthful of method shouldn't throw the reins on his neck and letting them flap there as free as in gil blas or in david copperfield equip him with the double privilege of subject and object a course that has at least the merit of brushing away questions at a sweep the answer to which is i think that one makes that surrender only if one is prepared not to make certain precious discriminations the first person then so employed is addressed by the author directly to ourselves his possible readers whom he has to reckon with at the best by our english tradition so loosely and vaguely after all so little respectfully on so scant a presumption of exposure to criticism strether on the other hand encaged and provided for as the ambassadors encages and provides has to keep in view proprieties much stiffer and more salutary than any our straight and credulous gape are likely to bring home to him has exhibitional conditions to meet in a word that forbid the terrible fluidity of self revelation i may seem not to better the case for my discrimination if i say that for my first care i had thus inevitably to set him up a confidant or two to wave away with energy the custom of the seated mass of explanation after the fact the inserted block of merely referential narrative which flourishes so to the shame of the modern impatience on the serried page of balzac but which seems simply to appal our actual our general weaker digestion harking back to make up took at any rate more doing as the phrase is not only than the reader of to day demands but than he will tolerate at any price any call upon him either to understand or remotely to measure and for the beauty of the thing when done the current editorial mind in particular appears wholly without sense it is not however primarily for either of these reasons whatever their weight that strether's friend waymarsh is so keenly clutched at on the threshold of the book or that no less a pounce is made on maria gostrey without even the pretext either of her being in essence strether's friend she is the reader's friend much rather in consequence of dispositions that make him so eminently require one and she acts in that capacity and really in that capacity alone with exemplary devotion from beginning to and of the book she is an enrolled a direct aid to lucidity she is in fine to tear off her mask the most unmitigated and abandoned of ficelles half the dramatist's art as we well know since if we don't it's not the fault of the proofs that lie scattered about us is in the use of ficelles by which i mean in a deep dissimulation of his dependence on them waymarsh only to a slighter degree belongs in the whole business less to my subject than to my treatment of it the interesting proof in these connexions being that one has but to take one's subject for the stuff of drama to interweave with enthusiasm as many gostreys as need be the material of the ambassadors conforming in this respect exactly to that of the wings of the dove published just before it is taken absolutely for the stuff of drama so that availing myself of the opportunity given me by this edition for some prefatory remarks on the latter work i had mainly to make on its behalf the point of its scenic consistency it disguises that virtue in the oddest way in the world by just looking as we turn its pages as little scenic as possible but it sharply divides itself just as the composition before us does into the parts that prepare that tend in fact to over prepare for scenes and the parts or otherwise into the scenes that justify and crown the preparation it may definitely be said i think that everything in it that is not scene not i of course mean complete and functional scene treating all the submitted matter as by logical start logical turn and logical finish is discriminated preparation is the fusion and synthesis of picture these alternations propose themselves all recogniseably i think from an early stage as the very form and figure of the ambassadors so that to repeat such an agent as miss gostrey pre engaged at a high salary but waits in the draughty wing with her shawl and her smelling salts her function speaks at once for itself and by the time she has dined with strether in london and gone to a play with him her intervention as a ficelle is i hold expertly justified thanks to it we have treated scenically and scenically alone the whole lumpish question of strether's past which has seen us more happily on the way than anything else could have done we have strained to a high lucidity and vivacity or at least we hope we have certain indispensable facts we have seen our two or three immediate friends all conveniently and profitably in action to say nothing of our beginning to descry others of a remoter intensity getting into motion even if a bit vaguely as yet for our further enrichment let my first point be here that the scene in question that in which the whole situation at woollett and the complex forces that have propelled my hero to where this lively extractor of his value and distiller of his essence awaits him is normal and entire is really an excellent standard scene copious comprehensive and accordingly never short but with its office as definite as that of the hammer on the gong of the clock the office of expressing all that is in the hour the ficelle character of the subordinate party is as artfully dissimulated throughout as may be and to that extent that with the seams or joints of maria gostrey's ostensible connectedness taken particular care of duly smoothed over that is and anxiously kept from showing as pieced on this figure doubtless achieves after a fashion something of the dignity of a prime idea which circumstance but shows us afresh how many quite incalculable but none the less clear sources of enjoyment for the infatuated artist how many copious springs of our never to be slighted fun for the reader and critic susceptible of contagion may sound their incidental plash as soon as an artistic process begins to enjoy free development exquisite in illustration of this the mere interest and amusement of such at once creative and critical questions as how and where and why to make miss gostrey's false connexion carry itself under a due high polish as a real one nowhere is it more of an artful expedient for mere consistency of form to mention a case than in the last scene of the book where its function is to give or to add nothing whatever but only to express as vividly as possible certain things quite other than itself and that are of the already fixed and appointed measure since however all art is expression and is thereby vividness one was to find the door open here to any amount of delightful dissimulation these verily are the refinements and ecstasies of method amid which or certainly under the influence of any exhilarated demonstration of which one must keep one's head and not lose one's way to cultivate an adequate intelligence for them and to make that sense operative is positively to find a charm in any produced ambiguity of appearance that is not by the same stroke and all helplessly an ambiguity of sense to project imaginatively for my hero a relation that has nothing to do with the matter the matter of my subject but has everything to do with the manner the manner of my presentation of the same and yet to treat it at close quarters and for fully economic expression's possible sake as if it were important and essential to do that sort of thing and yet muddle nothing may easily become as one goes a signally attaching proposition even though it all remains but part and parcel i hasten to recognise of the merely general and related question of expressional curiosity and expressional decency i am moved to add after so much insistence on the scenic side of my labour that i have found the steps of re perusal almost as much waylaid here by quite another style of effort in the same signal interest or have in other words not failed to note how even so associated and so discriminated the finest proprieties and charms of the non scenic may under the right hand for them still keep their intelligibility and assert their office infinitely suggestive such an observation as this last on the whole delightful head where representation is concerned of possible variety of effective expressional change and contrast one would like at such an hour as this for critical licence to go into the matter of the noted inevitable deviation from too fond an original vision that the exquisite treachery even of the straightest execution may ever be trusted to inflict even on the most mature plan the case being that though one's last reconsidered production always seems to bristle with that particular evidence the ambassadors would place a flood of such light at my service i must attach to my final remark here a different import noting in the other connexion i just glanced at that such passages as that of my hero's first encounter with chad newsome absolute attestations of the non scenic form though they be yet lay the firmest hand too so far at least as intention goes on representational effect to report at all closely and completely of what passes on a given occasion is inevitably to become more or less scenic and yet in the instance i allude to with the conveyance expressional curiosity and expressional decency are sought and arrived at under quite another law the true inwardness of this may be at bottom but that one of the suffered treacheries has consisted precisely for chad's whole figure and presence of a direct presentability diminished and compromised despoiled that is of its proportional advantage so that in a word the whole economy of his author's relation to him has at important points to be redetermined the book however critically viewed is touchingly full of these disguised and repaired losses these insidious recoveries these intensely redemptive consistencies the pages in which mamie pocock gives her appointed and i can't but think duly felt lift to the whole action by the so inscrutably applied side stroke or short cut of our just watching and as quite at an angle of vision as yet untried her single hour of suspense in the hotel salon in our partaking of her concentrated study of the sense of matters bearing on her own case all the bright warm paris afternoon from the balcony that overlooks the tuileries garden these are as marked an example of the representational virtue that insists here and there on being for the charm of opposition and renewal other than the scenic it wouldn't take much to make me further argue that from an equal play of such oppositions the book gathers an intensity that fairly adds to the dramatic though the latter is supposed to be the sum of all intensities or that has at any rate nothing to fear from juxtaposition with it i consciously fail to shrink in fact from that extravagance i risk it rather for the sake of the moral involved which is not that the particular production before us exhausts the interesting questions it raises but that the novel remains still under the right persuasion the most independent most elastic most prodigious of literary forms henry james book first i strether's first question when he reached the hotel was about his friend yet on his learning that waymarsh was apparently not to arrive till evening he was not wholly disconcerted a telegram from him bespeaking a room only if not noisy reply paid was produced for the enquirer at the office so that the understanding they should meet at chester rather than at liverpool remained to that extent sound the same secret principle however that had prompted strether not absolutely to desire waymarsh's presence at the dock that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it now operated to make him feel he could still wait without disappointment they would dine together at the worst and with all respect to dear old waymarsh if not even for that matter to himself there was little fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other the principle i have just mentioned as operating had been with the most newly disembarked of the two men wholly instinctive the fruit of a sharp sense that delightful as it would be to find himself looking after so much separation into his comrade's face his business would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first note of europe mixed with everything was the apprehension already on strether's part that it would at best throughout prove the note of europe in quite a sufficient degree that note had been meanwhile since the previous afternoon thanks to this happier device such a consciousness of personal freedom as he hadn't known for years such a deep taste of change and of having above all for the moment nobody and nothing to consider as promised already if headlong hope were not too foolish to colour his adventure with cool success there were people on the ship with whom he had easily consorted so far as ease could up to now be imputed to him and who for the most part plunged straight into the current that set from the landing stage to london there were others who had invited him to a tryst at the inn and had even invoked his aid for a look round at the beauties of liverpool but he had stolen away from every one alike had kept no appointment and renewed no acquaintance had been indifferently aware of the number of persons who esteemed themselves fortunate in being unlike himself met and had even independently unsociably alone without encounter or relapse and by mere quiet evasion given his afternoon and evening to the immediate and the sensible they formed a qualified draught of europe an afternoon and an evening on the banks of the mersey but such as it was he took his potion at least undiluted he winced a little truly at the thought that waymarsh might be already at chester he reflected that should he have to describe himself there as having got in so early it would be difficult to make the interval look particularly eager but he was like a man who elatedly finding in his pocket more money than usual handles it a while and idly and pleasantly chinks it before addressing himself to the business of spending that he was prepared to be vague to waymarsh about the hour of the ship's touching and that he both wanted extremely to see him and enjoyed extremely the duration of delay these things it is to be conceived were early signs in him that his relation to his actual errand might prove none of the simplest he was burdened poor strether it had better be confessed at the outset with the oddity of a double consciousness there was detachment in his zeal and curiosity in his indifference after the young woman in the glass cage had held up to him across her counter the pale pink leaflet bearing his friend's name which she neatly pronounced he turned away to find himself in the hall facing a lady who met his eyes as with an intention suddenly determined and whose features not freshly young not markedly fine but on happy terms with each other came back to him as from a recent vision for a moment they stood confronted then the moment placed her he had noticed her the day before noticed her at his previous inn where again in the hall she had been briefly engaged with some people of his own ship's company nothing had actually passed between them and he would as little have been able to say what had been the sign of her face for him on the first occasion as to name the ground of his present recognition recognition at any rate appeared to prevail on her own side as well which would only have added to the mystery all she now began by saying to him nevertheless was that having chanced to catch his enquiry she was moved to ask by his leave if it were possibly a question of mr waymarsh of milrose connecticut mr waymarsh the american lawyer oh yes he replied my very well known friend he's to meet me here coming up from malvern and i supposed he'd already have arrived but he doesn't come till later and i'm relieved not to have kept him do you know him strether wound up it wasn't till after he had spoken that he became aware of how much there had been in him of response when the tone of her own rejoinder as well as the play of something more in her face something more that is than its apparently usual restless light seemed to notify him i've met him at milrose where i used sometimes a good while ago to stay i had friends there who were friends of his and i've been at his house i won't answer for it that he would know me strether's new acquaintance pursued but i should be delighted to see him perhaps she added i shall for i'm staying over she paused while our friend took in these things and it was as if a good deal of talk had already passed they even vaguely smiled at it and strether presently observed that mr waymarsh would no doubt be easily to be seen this however appeared to affect the lady as if she might have advanced too far she appeared to have no reserves about anything oh she said he won't care and she immediately thereupon remarked that she believed strether knew the munsters the munsters being the people he had seen her with at liverpool but he didn't it happened know the munsters well enough to give the case much of a lift so that they were left together as if over the mere laid table of conversation her qualification of the mentioned connexion had rather removed than placed a dish and there seemed nothing else to serve their attitude remained none the less that of not forsaking the board and the effect of this in turn was to give them the appearance of having accepted each other with an absence of preliminaries practically complete they moved along the hall together and strether's companion threw off that the hotel had the advantage of a garden he was aware by this time of his strange inconsequence he had shirked the intimacies of the steamer and had muffled the shock of waymarsh only to find himself forsaken in this sudden case both of avoidance and of caution he passed under this unsought protection and before he had so much as gone up to his room into the garden of the hotel and at the end of ten minutes had agreed to meet there again as soon as he should have made himself tidy the dispenser of such good assurances he wanted to look at the town and they would forthwith look together it was almost as if she had been in possession and received him as a guest her acquaintance with the place presented her in a manner as a hostess and strether had a rueful glance for the lady in the glass cage it was as if this personage had seen herself instantly superseded when in a quarter of an hour he came down what his hostess saw what she might have taken in with a vision kindly adjusted was the lean the slightly loose figure of a man of the middle height and something more perhaps than the middle age a man of five and fifty whose most immediate signs were a marked bloodless brownness of face a thick dark moustache of characteristically american cut growing strong and falling low a head of hair still abundant but irregularly streaked with grey and a nose of bold free prominence the even line the high finish as it might have been called of which had a certain effect of mitigation a perpetual pair of glasses astride of this fine ridge and a line unusually deep and drawn the prolonged pen stroke of time accompanying the curve of the moustache from nostril to chin did something to complete the facial furniture that an attentive observer would have seen catalogued on the spot in the vision of the other party to strether's appointment she waited for him in the garden the other party drawing on a pair of singularly fresh soft and elastic light gloves and presenting herself with a superficial readiness which as he approached her over the small smooth lawn and in the watery english sunshine he might with his rougher preparation have marked as the model for such an occasion she had this lady a perfect plain propriety an expensive subdued suitability that her companion was not free to analyse but that struck him so that his consciousness of it was instantly acute as a quality quite new to him before reaching her he stopped on the grass and went through the form of feeling for something possibly forgotten in the light overcoat he carried on his arm yet the essence of the act was no more than the impulse to gain time nothing could have been odder than strether's sense of himself as at that moment launched in something of which the sense would be quite disconnected from the sense of his past and which was literally beginning there and then it had begun in fact already upstairs and before the dressing glass that struck him as blocking further so strangely the dimness of the window of his dull bedroom begun with a sharper survey of the elements of appearance than he had for a long time been moved to make he had during those moments felt these elements to be not so much to his hand as he should have liked and then had fallen back on the thought that they were precisely a matter as to which help was supposed to come from what he was about to do he was about to go up to london so that hat and necktie might wait what had come as straight to him as a ball in a well played game and caught moreover not less neatly was just the air in the person of his friend of having seen and chosen the air of achieved possession of those vague qualities and quantities that collectively figured to him as the advantage snatched from lucky chances without pomp or circumstance certainly as her original address to him equally with his own response had been he would have sketched to himself his impression of her as well she's more thoroughly civilized if more thoroughly than whom would not have been for him a sequel to this remark that was just by reason of his deep consciousness of the bearing of his comparison the amusement at all events of a civilisation intenser was what familiar compatriot as she was with the full tone of the compatriot and the rattling link not with mystery but only with dear dyspeptic waymarsh she appeared distinctly to promise his pause while he felt in his overcoat was positively the pause of confidence and it enabled his eyes to make out as much of a case for her in proportion as her own made out for himself she affected him as almost insolently young but an easily carried five and thirty could still do that she was however like himself marked and wan only it naturally couldn't have been known to him how much a spectator looking from one to the other might have discerned that they had in common it wouldn't for such a spectator have been altogether insupposable that each so finely brown and so sharply spare each confessing so to dents of surface and aids to sight to a disproportionate nose and a head delicately or grossly grizzled they might have been brother and sister on this ground indeed there would have been a residuum of difference such a sister having surely known in respect to such a brother the extremity of separation and such a brother now feeling in respect to such a sister the extremity of surprise surprise it was true was not on the other hand what the eyes of strether's friend most showed him while she gave him stroking her gloves smoother the time he appreciated they had taken hold of him straightway measuring him up and down as if they knew how as if he were human material they had already in some sort handled their possessor was in truth it may be communicated the mistress of a hundred cases or categories receptacles of the mind subdivisions for convenience in which from a full experience she pigeon holed her fellow mortals with a hand as free as that of a compositor scattering type she was as equipped in this particular as strether was the reverse and it made an opposition between them which he might well have shrunk from submitting to if he had fully suspected it so far as he did suspect it he was on the contrary after a short shake of his consciousness as pleasantly passive as might be he really had a sort of sense of what she knew he had quite the sense that she knew things he didn't and though this was a concession that in general he found not easy to make to women he made it now as good humouredly as if it lifted a burden his eyes were so quiet behind his eternal nippers that they might almost have been absent without changing his face which took its expression mainly and not least its stamp of sensibility from other sources surface and grain and form he joined his guide in an instant and then felt she had profited still better than he by his having been for the moments just mentioned so at the disposal of her intelligence she knew even intimate things about him that he hadn't yet told her and perhaps never would he wasn't unaware that he had told her rather remarkably many for the time but these were not the real ones some of the real ones however precisely were what she knew they were to pass again through the hall of the inn to get into the street and it was here she presently checked him with a question have you looked up my name he could only stop with a laugh have you looked up mine oh dear yes as soon as you left me i went to the office and asked hadn't you better do the same he wondered find out who you are after the uplifted young woman there has seen us thus scrape acquaintance she laughed on her side now at the shade of alarm in his amusement isn't it a reason"
