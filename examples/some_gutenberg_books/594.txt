and glanced up at the court house already flames were issuing from it go in the house and let it burn indeed thought she he knows me don't he oh sir for the love of heaven won't you stop it she said entreatingly run in the house good mother that is a wise woman he advised down in her heart and as the very outcome of lip and brain she wanted to say you needn't mother me you murderous rascal but remembering everything that was at stake she crushed her wrath and buttoned it in as closely as she had uncle john behind the door in the morning and again with swift gentleness laid her hand on his arm he turned and looked at her vexed at her persistence and extremely annoyed at intelligence that had just reached him from the north bridge he said imperiously get away or you'll be trodden down by the horses i can't go she cried clasping his arm and fairly clinging to it in her frenzy of excitement oh stop the fire quick quick or my house will burn i have no time to put out your fires he said carelessly shaking loose from her hold and turning to meet a messenger with news poor little woman what could she do the wind was rising and the fire grew flame was creeping out in a little blue curl in a new place under the rafter's edge and nobody cared that was what increased the pressing misery of it all it was so unlike a common country alarm where everybody rushed up and down the streets crying fire fire f i r e and went hurrying to and fro for pails of water to help put it out until that moment the little woman did not know how utterly deserted she was in very despair she ran to her house seized two pails filled them with greater haste than she had ever drawn water before and regardless of uncle john's imprecations carried them forth one in either hand the water dripping carelessly down the side breadths of her fair silk gown her silvery curls tossed and tumbled in white confusion her pleasant face aflame with eagerness and her clear eyes suffused with tears thus equipped with facts and feeling she once more appeared to major pitcairn have you a mother in old england she cried if so for her sake stop this fire her words touched his heart and if i do he answered then your johnny cake on my hearth won't burn up she said with a quick little smile adjusting her cap major pitcairn laughed and two soldiers at his command seized the pails and made haste to the court house followed by many more for awhile the fire seemed victorious but by brave effort it was finally overcome and the court house saved at a distance joe devins had noticed the smoke hovering like a little cloud then sailing away still more like a cloud over the town and he had made haste to the scene arriving in time to venture on the roof and do good service there after the fire was extinguished he thought of martha moulton and he could not help feeling a bit guilty at the consciousness that he had gone off and left her alone going to the house he found her entertaining the king's troopers with the best food her humble store afforded she was so charmed with herself and so utterly well pleased with the success of her pleading that the little woman's nerves fairly quivered with jubilation and best of all the blue stocking was still safe in the well for had she not watched with her own eyes every time the bucket was dipped to fetch up water for the fire having somehow got rid of the vow she had taken regarding the drawing of the water as she saw the lad looking with surprised countenance into the room where the feast was going on a fear crept up her own face and darted out from her eyes it was lest joe devins should spoil it all by ill timed words she made haste to meet him basket in hand here joe she said fetch me some small wood there's a good boy as she gave him the basket she was just in time to stop the rejoinder that was issuing from his lips in time to intercept his return she was at the wood pile joe she said half abashed before the truth that shone in the boy's eyes joe she repeated you know major pitcairn ordered the fire put out to please me because i begged him so and in return what can i do but give them something to eat come and help me i won't responded joe their hands are red with blood they've killed two men at the bridge who's killed she asked trembling but joe would not tell her he demanded to know what had been done with uncle john he's quiet enough up stairs she replied with a sudden spasm of feeling that she had neglected uncle john shamefully still with the day and the fire and everything how could she help it but really it did seem strange that he made no noise with a hundred armed men coming and going through the house at least that was what joe thought and having deposited the basket of wood on the threshold of the kitchen door he departed around the corner of the house presently he had climbed a pear tree dropped from one of its overhanging branches on the lean to raised a sash and crept into the window slipping off his shoes heavy with spring mud he proceeded to search for uncle john he was not in his own room he was not in the guest chamber he was not in any one of the rooms on the floor by the window in the hall looking out upon the green he found the broken cup and saucer that martha moulton had let fall having made a second round in which he investigated every closet and penetrated into the spaces under beds joe thought of the garret tramp tramp went the heavy feet on the sanded floors below drowning every possible sound from above nevertheless as the lad opened the door leading into the garret he whispered cautiously uncle john uncle john all was silent above joe went up and was startled by a groan he had to stand a few seconds to let the darkness grow into light ere he could see and when he could discern outlines in the dimness there was given to him the picture of uncle john lying helpless amid and upon the nubbins that had been piled over his strong box why uncle john are you dead asked joe climbing over to his side is the house afire was the response house afire no the confounded red coats up and put it out i thought they was going to let me burn to death up here groaned uncle john can i help you up and joe proffered two strong hands rather black with toil and smoke no no you can't help me if the house isn't afire i'll stand it till the fellows are gone and then joe you fetch the doctor as quick as you can you can't get a doctor for love nor money this night uncle john there's too much work to be done in lexington and concord to night for wounded and dying men and there'll be more of em too afore a single red coat sees boston again they'll be hunted down every step of the way they've killed captain davis from acton you don't say so yes they have and i say joe devins go down and do do something there's my niece a feeding the murderers i'll disown her she shan't have a penny of my pounds she shan't both joe and uncle john were compelled to remain in inaction while below the weary little woman acted the kind hostess to his majesty's troops but now the feast was spent and the soldiers were summoned to begin their painful march assembled on the green all was ready when major pitcairn remembering the little woman who had ministered to his wants returned to the house to say farewell twas but a step to her door and but a moment since he had left it but he found her crying crying with joy in the very chair where he had found her at prayers in the morning i would like to say good by he said you've been very kind to me to day with a quick dash or two of the dotted white apron spotless no longer to her eye she arose major pitcairn extended his hand but she folded her own closely together and said i wish you a pleasant journey back to boston sir will you not shake hands with me before i go i can feed the enemy of my country but shake hands with him never for the first time that day the little woman's love of country seemed to rise triumphant within her and drown every impulse to selfishness or was it the nearness to safety that she felt human conduct is the result of so many motives that it is sometimes impossible to name the compound although on that occasion martha moulton labelled it patriotism and yet i put out the fire for you he said for your mother's sake in old england it was you remember sir i remember said major pitcairn with a sigh as he turned away and for her sake i will shake hands with you said martha moulton so he turned back and across the threshold in presence of the waiting troops the commander of the expedition to concord and the only woman in the town shook hands at parting martha moulton saw major pitcairn mount his horse heard the order given for the march to begin the march of which you all have heard you know what a sorry time the red coats had of it in getting back to boston how they were fought at every inch of the way and waylaid from behind every convenient tree trunk and shot at from tree tops and aimed at from upper windows and beseiged from behind stone walls and in short made so miserable and harassed and overworn that at last their depleted ranks with the tongues of the men parched and hanging were fain to lie down by the road side and take what came next even though it might be death and then the dead they left behind them ah there's nothing wholesome to mind or body about war until long long after it is over and the earth has had time to hide the blood and send it forth in sweet blooms of liberty with forget me nots springing thick between the men of that day are long dead the same soil holds regulars and minute men england who over ruled and the provinces that put out brave hands to seize their rights are good friends to day and have shaken hands over many a threshold of hearty thought and kind deeds since that time the tree of liberty grows yet stately and fair for the men of the revolution planted it well and surely god himself hath given it increase so we gather to day in this our story a forget me not more from the old town of concord when the troops had marched away the weary little woman laid aside her silken gown resumed her homespun dress and immediately began to think of getting uncle john down stairs again into his easy chair but it required more aid than she could give to lift the fallen man at last joe devins summoned returning neighbors who came to the rescue and the poor nubbins were left to the rats once more joe climbed down the well and rescued the blue stocking with its treasures unharmed even to the precious watch which watch was martha moulton's chief treasure and one of very few in the town martha moulton was the heroine of the day the house was beseiged by admiring men and women that night and for two or three days thereafter but when years later she being older and poorer even to want petitioned the general court for a reward for the service she rendered in persuading major pitcairn to save the court house from burning there was granted to her only fifteen dollars a poor little forget me not it is true but just enough to carry her story down the years whereas but for that it might never have been wafted up and down the land sweep sweep sweep up all this dirt and dust for mamma is busy today and help her i surely must everything now is spick and span away to my play i will run it will be such a sprise to mamma to find all this work is done the conquest of fairyland there reigned a king in the land of persia mighty and great was he grown on the necks of the kings of the conquered earth he builded up his throne there sate a king on the throne of persia and he was grown so proud that all the life of the world was less to him than a passing cloud he reigned in glory joy and sorrow lying between his hands if he sighed a nation shook his smile ripened the harvest of lands he was the saddest man beneath the everlasting sky for all his glories had left him old and the proudest king must die he who was even as god to all the nations of men must die as the merest peasant dies and turn into earth again and his life with the fear of death was bitter and sick and accursed as brackish water to drink of which is to be forever athirst the hateful years rolled on and on but once it chanced at noon the drowsy court was thrilled to gladness it echoed so sweet a tune low as the lapping of tile sea as the song of the lark is clear wild as the moaning of pine branches the king was fain to hear what is the song and who is the singer he said before the throne let him come for the songs of the world are mine and all but this are known seven mighty kings went out the minstrel man to find and all they found was a dead cyprus soughing in the wind and slower still and sadder still the heavy winters rolled and the burning summers waned away and the king grew very old dull worn feeble bent and once he thought to die were rest at least and as he thought the music wandered by into the presence of the king singing the singer came and his face was like the spring in flower his eyes were clear as flame what is the song you play and what the theme your praises sing it is sweet i knew not i owned a thing so sweet said the weary king i sing my country said the singer a land that is sweeter than song which of my kingdoms is your country thither would i along great o king is thy power and the earth a footstool for thy feet but my country is free and my own country and oh my country is sweet as he heard the eyes of the king grew young and alive with fire lo is there left on the earth a thing to strive for a thing to desire where is thy country tell me o singer speak thine innermost heart leave thy music speak plainly speak forget thine art the eyes of the singer shone as he sang and his voice rang wild and free as the elemental wind or the uncontrollable sobs of the sea o my distant home he sighed oh alas away and afar i watch thee now as a lost sailor watches a shining star oh that a wind would take me there that a bird would set me down where the golden streets shine red at sunset in my father's town for only in dreams i see the faces of the women there and fain would i hear them singing once braiding their ropes of hair oh i am thirsty and long to drink of the river of life and i am fain to find my own country where no man shall die out of the light of the throne the king looked down as in the spring the green leaves burst from their dusky buds so was hope in the eyes of the king lo he said i will make thee great i will make thee mighty in sway even as i but the name of thy country speak and the place and the way oh the way to my country is ever north till you pass the mouth of hell past the limbo of dreams and the desolate land where shadows dwell and when you have reached the fount of wonder you ford the waters wan to the land of elves and the land of fairies enchanted masinderan the singer ceased and the lyre in his hand snapped as a cord in twain and neither lyre nor singer was seen in the kingdom of persia again and all the nobles gazed astounded no man spoke a word till the old king said call out my armies bring me hither a sword as a little torrent swollen by snows is turned to a terrible stream so the gathering voices of all his countries cried to the king in his dream crying for thee o our king for thee we had freely and willingly died warriors martyrs what thou wilt not that our lives betide the worth of a thought to the king but rather because thy rod is over our heads as over thine is the changeless will of god rather for this we beseech thee o master for thine own sake refrain from the blasphemous madness of pride from the fever of impious gain you seek my death the king thundered you cry forbear to save the life of a king too old to frolic let him sleep in the grave but i will live for all your treason and by my own right hand i will set out this day with you to conquer fairyland then all the nations paled aghast for the battle to begin was a war with god and a war with death and they knew the thing was sin sick at heart they gathered together but none denounced the wrong for the will of god was unseen unsaid and the will of the king was strong so the air grew bright with spears and the earth shook under the tread of the mighty horses harnessed for battle the standards flaunted red and the wind was loud with the blare of trumpets and every house was void of the strength and stay of the house and the peace of the land destroyed and the growing corn was trodden under the weight of armed feet and every woman in persia cursed the sound of a song too sweet cursed the insensate longing for life in the heart of a sick old man but the king of persia with all his armies marched on masinderan many a day they marched in the sun till their silver armour was lead to sink their bodies into the grave and many a man fell dead and they passed the mouth of hell and the shadowy country gray where the air is mist and the people mist and the rain more real than they and they came to the fount of wonder and forded the waters wan and the king of persia and all his armies marched on masinderan and they turned the rivers to blood and the fields to a ravaged camp and they neared the golden faery town that burned in the dusk as a lamp and they stood and shouted for joy to see it stand so nigh given into their hands for spoil and their hearts beat proud and high and the armies longed for the morrow to conquer the shining town for there was no death in the land neither any to strike them down the hosts were many in numbers mighty and skilled in the strife and they lusted for gold and conquest as the old king lusted for life and gazing on the golden place night took them unaware and black and windy grew the skies and black the eddying air so long the night and black the night that fell upon their eyes they quaked with fear those mighty hosts the sun would never rise darkness and deafening sounds confused the black tempestuous air and no man saw his neighbor's face nor heard his neighbor's prayer and wild with terror the raging armies fell on each other in fight the ground was strewn with wounded men mad in the horrible night mad with eternal pain with darkness and stabbing blows rained on all sides from invisible hands till the ground was red as a rose and though he was longing for rest none ventured to pause from the strife lest haply another wound be his to poison his hateful life and the king entreated death and for peace the armies prayed but the gifts of god are everlasting his word is not gainsaid gold and battle are given the hosts their boon is turned to a ban and the curse of the king is to reign forever in conquered masinderan a mary f robinson handy spandy jack a dandy loved plum cake and sugar candy he bought some at a grocer's shop and out he come with a hop hop hop jocko is a monkey dressed just like a clown with the grinding organ man he travels round the town jocko jocko climb a pole jocko climb a tree jocko jocko tip your cap and make a bow to me kentucky belle summer of sixty three sir and conrad was gone away gone to the county town sir to sell our first load of hay we lived in the log house yonder poor as ever you've seen roschen there was a baby and i was only nineteen conrad he took the oxen but he left kentucky belle how much we thought of kentucky i couldn't begin to tell came from the blue grass country my father gave her to me when i rode north with conrad away from tennessee conrad lived in ohio a german he is you know the house stood in broad corn fields stretching on row after row the old folks made me welcome they were kind as kind could be but i kept longing longing for the hills of tennessee o for a sight of water the shadowed slope of a hill clouds that hang on the summit a wind that is never still but the level land went stretching away to meet the sky never a rise from north to south to rest the weary eye from east to west no river to shine out under the moon nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon only the breathless sunshine as i looked out all forlorn only the rustle rustle as i walked among the corn when i fell sick with pining we didn't wait any more but moved away from the corn lands out to this river shore the tuscarawas it's called sir off there's a hill you see and now i've grown to like it next best to the tennessee i was at work that morning some one came riding like mad over the bridge and up the road farmer rouf's little lad bareback he rode he had no hat he hardly stopped to say morgan's men are coming frau they're galloping on this way i'm sent to warn the neighbors he isn't a mile behind he sweeps up all the horses every horse that he can find morgan morgan the raider and morgan's terrible men with bowie knives and pistols are galloping up the glen the lad rode down the valley and i stood still at the door the baby laughed and prattled playing with spools on the floor kentuck was out in the pasture conrad my man was gone nearer nearer morgan's men were galloping galloping on sudden i picked up the baby and ran to the pasture bar kentuck i called kentucky she knew me ever so far i led her down the gully that turns off there to the right and tied her to the bushes her head was just out of sight as i ran back to the log house at once there came a sound the ring of hoofs galloping hoofs trembling over the ground coming into the turnpike out from the white woman glen morgan morgan the raider and morgan's terrible men as near they drew and nearer my heart beat fast in alarm but still i stood in the doorway with baby on my arm they came they passed with spur and whip in haste they sped along morgan morgan the raider and his band six hundred strong weary they looked and jaded riding through night and through day pushing on east to the river many long miles away to the border strip where virginia runs up into the west to ford the upper ohio before they could stop to rest on like the wind they hurried and morgan rode in advance bright were his eyes like live coals as he gave me a sideways glance and i was just breathing freely after my choking pain when the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein frightened i was to death sir i scarce dared look in his face as he asked for a drink of water and glanced around the place i gave him a cup and he smiled twas only a boy you see faint and worn with dim blue eyes and he'd sailed on the tennessee only sixteen he was sir a fond mother's only son off and away with morgan before his life had begun the damp drops stood on his temples drawn was the boyish mouth and i thought me of the mother waiting down in the south o pluck was he to the backbone and clear grit through and through boasted and bragged like a trooper but the big words wouldn't do the boy was dying sir dying as plain as plain could be worn out by his ride with morgan up from the tennessee but when i told the laddie that i too was from the south water came into his dim eyes and quivers around his mouth do you know the blue grass country he wistfully began to say then swayed like a willow sapling and fainted dead away i had him into the log house and worked and brought him to i fed him and i coaxed him as i thought his mother'd do and when the lad got better and the noise in his head was gone morgan's men were miles away galloping galloping on o i must go he muttered i must be up and away morgan morgan is waiting for me o what will morgan say but i heard the sound of tramping and kept him back from the door the ringing sound of horses hoofs that i had heard before and on on came the soldiers the michigan cavalry and fast they rode and back they looked galloping rapidly they had followed hard on morgan's track they had followed day and night but of morgan and morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight and rich ohio sat startled through all these summer days for strange wild men were galloping over her broad highways now here now there now seen now gone now north now east now west through river valleys and corn land farms sweeping away her best a bold ride and a long ride but they were taken at last they had almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast but the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford and morgan morgan the raider laid down his terrible sword well i kept the boy till evening kept him against his will but he was too weak to follow and sat there pale and still when it was cool and dusky you'll wonder to hear me tell but i stole down to the gully and brought up kentucky belle i kissed the star on her forehead my pretty gentle lass but i knew that she'd be happy back in the old blue grass a suit of clothes of conrad's with all the money i had and kentucky pretty kentucky i gave to the worn out lad i guided him to the southward as well as i knew how the boy rode off with many thanks and many a backward bow and then the glow it faded and my heart began to swell and down the glen away she went my lost kentucky belle when conrad came in the evening the moon was shining high baby and i
