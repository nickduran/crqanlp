"1" "force pump works the wrong way i mean in the case of the unfortunate princess it draws in where it should force out and forces out where it should draw in the offices of the auricles and the ventricles are subverted the blood is sent forth by the veins and returns by the arteries consequently it is running the wrong way through all her corporeal organism lungs and all is it then at all mysterious seeing that such is the case that on the other particular of gravitation as well she should differ from normal humanity my proposal for the cure is this phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety let it be effected if necessary in a warm bath when she is reduced to a state of perfect asphyxy apply a ligature to the left ankle drawing it as tight as the bone will bear apply at the same moment another of equal tension around the right wrist by means of plates constructed for the purpose place the other foot and hand under the receivers of two air pumps exhaust the receivers exhibit a pint of french brandy and await the result which would presently arrive in the form of grim death said kopy keck if it should she would yet die in doing our duty retorted hum drum but their majesties had too much tenderness for their volatile offspring to subject her to either of the schemes of the equally unscrupulous philosophers indeed the most complete knowledge of the laws of nature would have been unserviceable in her case for it was impossible to classify her she was a fifth imponderable body sharing all the other properties of the ponderable 8 try a drop of water perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in love but how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is a difficulty perhaps the difficulty as for her own feelings on the subject she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey and stings to be fallen into but now i come to mention another curious fact about her the palace was built on the shores of the loveliest lake in the world and the princess loved this lake more than father or mother the root of this preference no doubt although the princess did not recognise it as such was that the moment she got into it she recovered the natural right of which she had been so wickedly deprived namely gravity whether this was owing to the fact that water had been employed as the means of conveying the injury i do not know but it is certain that she could swim and dive like the duck that her old nurse said she was the manner in which this alleviation of her misfortune was discovered was as follows one summer evening during the carnival of the country she had been taken upon the lake by the king and queen in the royal barge they were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats in the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor's barge for his daughter who was a great favourite with her was in it with her father now though the old king rarely condescended to make light of his misfortune yet happening on this occasion to be in a particularly good humour as the barges approached each other he caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor's barge he lost his balance however and dropping into the bottom of the barge lost his hold of his daughter not however before imparting to her the downward tendency of his own person though in a somewhat different direction for as the king fell into the boat she fell into the water with a burst of delighted laughter she disappeared in the lake a cry of horror ascended from the boats they had never seen the princess go down before half the men were under water in a moment but they had all one after another come up to the surface again for breath when tinkle tinkle babble and gush came the princess's laugh over the water from far away there she was swimming like a swan nor would she come out for king or queen chancellor or daughter she was perfectly obstinate but at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual perhaps that was because a great pleasure spoils laughing at all events after this the passion of her life was to get into the water and she was always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of it summer and winter it was quite the same only she could not stay so long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in any day from morning till evening in summer she might be descried a streak of white in the blue water lying as still as the shadow of a cloud or shooting along like a dolphin disappearing and coming up again far off just where one did not expect her she would have been in the lake of a night too if she could have had her way for the balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it and through a shallow reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water and no one would have been any the wiser indeed when she happened to wake in the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation but there was the sad difficulty of getting into it she had as great a dread of the air as some children have of the water for the slightest gust of wind would blow her away and a gust might arise in the stillest moment and if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of reaching it her situation would be dreadfully awkward irrespective of the wind for at best there she would have to remain suspended in her nightgown till she was seen and angled for by someone from the window oh if i had my gravity thought she contemplating the water i would flash off this balcony like a long white sea bird headlong into the darling wetness heigh ho this was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people another reason for her being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom for she could not walk out without a cortege consisting in part of a troop of light horse for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her and the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress and held by twenty noblemen of course horseback was out of the question but she bade good by to all this ceremony when she got into the water and so remarkable were its effects upon her especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity that hum drum and kopy keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years in the hope that as the water did her so much good the earth would do her yet more but the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment and would not give his consent foiled in this they yet agreed in another recommendation which seeing that one imported his opinions from china and the other from thibet was very remarkable indeed they argued that if water of external origin and application could be so efficacious water from a deeper source might work a perfect cure in short that if the poor afflicted princess could by any means be made to cry she might recover her lost gravity but how was this to be brought about therein lay all the difficulty to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough to make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh they sent for a professional beggar commanded him to prepare his most touching oracle of woe helped him out of the court charade box to whatever he wanted for dressing up and promised great rewards in the event of his success but it was all in vain she listened to the mendicant artist's story and gazed at his marvellous make up till she could contain herself no longer and went into the most undignified contortions for relief shrieking positively screeching with laughter when she had a little recovered herself she ordered her attendants to drive him away and not give him a single copper whereupon his look of mortified discomfiture wrought her punishment and his revenge for it sent her into violent hysterics from which she was with difficulty recovered but so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair trial that he put himself in a rage one day and rushing up to her room gave her an awful whipping yet not a tear would flow she looked grave and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming that was all the good old tyrant though he put on his best gold spectacles to look could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her eyes 9 put me in again it must have been about this time that the son of a king who lived a thousand miles from lagobel set out to look for the daughter of a queen he travelled far and wide but as sure as he found a princess he found some fault in her of course he could not marry a mere woman however beautiful and there was no princess to be found worthy of him whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself i cannot pretend to say all i know is that he was a fine handsome brave generous well bred and well behaved youth as all princes are in his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess but as everybody said she was bewitched he never dreamed that she could bewitch him for what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity who could tell what she might not lose next she might lose her visibility or her tangibility or in short the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive of course he made no further inquiries about her one day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest these forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers like a sieve that keeps back the bran then the princes get away to follow their fortunes in this way they have the advantage of the princesses who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun i wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes one lovely evening after wandering about for many days he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them and he soon came upon a kind of heath next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood but by this time it was getting late and there was nobody in the fields to direct him after travelling for another hour his horse quite worn out with long labour and lack of food fell and was unable to rise again so he continued his journey on foot at length he entered another wood not a wild forest but a civilized wood through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness suddenly he paused and listened strange sounds came across the water it was in fact the princess laughing now there was something odd in her laugh as i have already hinted for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming looking over the lake he saw something white in the water and in an instant he had torn off his tunic kicked off his sandals and plunged in he soon reached the white object and found that it was a woman there was not light enough to show that she was a princess but quite enough to show that she was a lady for it does not want much light to see that now i cannot tell how it came about whether she pretended to be drowning or whether he frightened her or caught her so as to embarrass her but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak at the place to which he bore her the bank was only a foot or two above the water so he gave her a strong lift out of the water to lay her on the bank but her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water away she went up into the air scolding and screaming you naughty naughty naughty naughty man she cried no one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before when the prince saw her ascend he thought he must have been bewitched and have mistaken a great swan for a lady but the princess caught hold of the topmost cone upon a lofty fir this came off but she caught at another and in fact stopped herself by gathering cones dropping them as the stalks gave way the prince meantime stood in the water staring and forgetting to get out but the princess disappearing he scrambled on shore and went in the direction of the tree there he found her climbing down one of the branches towards the stem but in the darkness of the wood the prince continued in some bewilderment as to what the phenomenon could be until reaching the ground and seeing him standing there she caught hold of him and said i'll tell papa oh no you won't returned the prince yes i will she persisted what business had you to pull me down out of the water and throw me to the bottom of the air i never did you any harm pardon me i did not mean to hurt you i don't believe you have any brains and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity i pity you the prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess and had already offended her but before he could think what to say next she burst out angrily giving a stamp with her foot that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm put me up directly put you up where you beauty asked the prince he had fallen in love with her almost already for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her and as far as he could see which certainly was not far she had not a single fault about her except of course that she had not any gravity no prince however would judge of a princess by weight the loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud put you up where you beauty asked the prince in the water you stupid answered the princess come then said the prince the condition of her dress increasing her usual difficulty in walking compelled her to cling to him and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream notwithstanding the torrent of musical abuse with which she overwhelmed him the prince being therefore in no hurry they came upon the lake at quite another part where the bank was twenty five feet high at least and when they had reached the edge he turned towards the princess and said how am i to put you in that is your business she answered quite snappishly you took me out put me in again very well said the prince and catching her up in his arms he sprang with her from the rock the princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them when they came to the surface she found that for a moment or two she could not even laugh for she had gone down with such a rush that it was with difficulty she recovered her breath the instant they reached the surface how do you like falling in said the prince after some effort the princess panted out is that what you call falling in yes answered the prince i should think it a very tolerable specimen it seemed to me like going up rejoined she my feeling was certainly one of elevation too the prince conceded the princess did not appear to understand him for she retorted his question how do you like falling in said the princess beyond everything answered he for i have fallen in with the only perfect creature i ever saw no more of that i am tired of it said the princess perhaps she shared her father's aversion to punning don't you like falling in then said the prince it is the most delightful fun i ever had in my life answered she i never fell before i wish i could learn to think i am the only person in my father's kingdom that can't fall here the poor princess looked almost sad i shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like said the prince devotedly thank you i don't know perhaps it would not be proper but i don't care at all events as we have fallen in let us have a swim together with all my heart responded the prince and away they went swimming and diving and floating until at last they heard cries along the shore and saw lights glancing in all directions it was now quite late and there was no moon i must go home said the princess i am very sorry for this is delightful so am i returned the prince but i am glad i haven't a home to go to at least i don't exactly know where it is i wish i hadn't one either rejoined the princess it is so stupid i have a great mind she continued to play them all a trick why couldn't they leave me alone they won't trust me in the lake for a single night you see where that green light is burning that is the window of my room now if you would just swim there with me very quietly and when we are all but under the balcony give me such a push up you call it as you did a little while ago i should be able to catch hold of the balcony and get in at the window and then they may look for me till to morrow morning with more obedience than pleasure said the prince gallantly and away they swam very gently will you be in the lake to morrow night the prince ventured to ask to be sure i will i don't think so perhaps was the princess's somewhat strange answer but the prince was intelligent enough not to press her further and merely whispered as he gave her the parting lift don't tell the only answer the princess returned was a roguish look she was already a yard above his head the look seemed to say never fear it is too good fun to spoil that way so perfectly like other people had she been in the water that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly grasp the balcony and disappear through the window he turned almost expecting to see her still by his side but he was alone in the water so he swam away quietly and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber as soon as they disappeared he landed in search of his tunic and sword and after some trouble found them again then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side there the wood was wilder and the shore steeper rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night and all night long he soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's room and where even in the broad daylight he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore it was a sort of cave in the rock where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake all night long he dreamed that he was swimming with the princess 10 look at the moon early the next morning the prince set out to look for something to eat which he soon found at a forester's hut where for many following days he was supplied with all that a brave prince could consider necessary and having plenty to keep him alive for the present he would not think of wants not yet in existence whenever care intruded this prince always bowed him out in the most princely manner when he returned from his breakfast to his watch cave he saw the princess already floating about in the lake attended by the king and queen whom he knew by their crowns and a great company in lovely little boats with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow and flags and streamers of a great many more it was a very bright day and soon the prince burned up with the heat began to long for the cold water and the cool princess but he had to endure till twilight for the boats had provisions on board and it was not till the sun went down that the gay party began to vanish boat after boat drew away to the shore following that of the king and queen till only one apparently the princess's own boat remained but she did not want to go home even yet and the prince thought he saw her order the boat to the shore without her at all events it rowed away and now of all the radiant company only one white speck remained then the prince began to sing and this is what he sung lady fair swan white lift thine eyes banish night by the might of thine eyes snowy arms oars of snow oar her hither plashing low soft and slow oar her hither stream behind her o'er the lake radiant whiteness in her wake following following for her sake radiant whiteness cling about her waters blue part not from her but renew cold and true kisses round her lap me round waters sad that have left her make me glad for ye had kissed her ere ye left her before he had finished his song the princess was just under the place where he sat and looking up to find him her ears had led her truly would you like a fall princess said the prince looking down ah there you are yes if you please prince said the princess looking up how do you know i am a prince princess said the prince because you are a very nice young man prince said the princess come up then princess fetch me prince the prince took off his scarf then his sword belt then his tunic and tied them all together and let them down but the line was far too short he unwound his turban and added it to the rest when it was all but long enough and his purse completed it the princess just managed to lay hold of the knot of money and was beside him in a moment this rock was much higher than the other and the splash and the dive were tremendous the princess was in ecstasies of delight and their swim was delicious night after night they met and swam about in the dark clear lake where such was the prince's gladness that whether the princess's way of looking at things infected him or he was actually getting light headed he often fancied that he was swimming in the sky instead of the lake but when he talked about being in heaven the princess laughed at him dreadfully when the moon came she brought them fresh pleasure everything looked strange and new in her light with an old withered yet unfading newness when the moon was nearly full one of their great delights was to dive deep in the water and then turning round look up through it at the great blot of light close above them shimmering and trembling and wavering spreading and contracting seeming to melt away and again grow solid then they would shoot up through the blot and lo there was the moon far off clear and steady and cold and very lovely at the bottom of a deeper and bluer lake than theirs as the princess said the prince soon found out that while in the water the princess was very like other people and besides this she was not so forward in her questions or pert in her replies at sea as on shore neither did she laugh so much and when she did laugh it was more gently she seemed altogether more modest and maidenly in the water than out of it but when the prince who had really fallen in love when he fell in the lake began to talk to her about love she always turned her head towards him and laughed after a while she began to look puzzled as if she were trying to understand what he meant but could not revealing a notion that he meant something but as soon as ever she left the lake she was so altered that the prince said to himself if i marry her i see no help for it we must turn merman and mermaid and go out to sea at once 11 hiss the princess's pleasure in the lake had grown to a passion and she could scarcely bear to be out of it for an hour imagine then her consternation when diving with the prince one night a sudden suspicion seized her that the lake was not so deep as it used to be the prince could not imagine what had happened she shot to the surface and without a word swam at full speed towards the higher side of the lake he followed begging to know if she was ill or what was the matter she never turned her head or took the smallest notice of his question arrived at the shore she coasted the rocks with minute inspection but she was not able to come to a conclusion for the moon was very small and so she could not see well she turned therefore and swam home without saying a word to explain her conduct to the prince of whose presence she seemed no longer conscious he withdrew to his cave in great perplexity and distress next day she made many observations which alas strengthened her fears she saw that the banks were too dry and that the grass on the shore and the trailing plants on the rocks were withering away she caused marks to be made along the borders and examined them day after day in all directions of the wind till at last the horrible idea became a certain fact that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking the poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had it was awful to her to see the lake which she loved more than any living thing lie dying before her eyes it sank away slowly vanishing the tops of rocks that had never been seen till now began to appear far down in the clear water before long they were dry in the sun it was fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and festering full of lovely creatures dying and ugly creatures coming to life like the unmaking of a world and how hot the sun would be without any lake she could not bear to swim in it any more and began to pine away her life seemed bound up with it and ever as the lake sank she pined people said she would not live an hour after the lake was gone but she never cried a proclamation was made to all the kingdom that whosoever should discover the cause of the lake's decrease would be rewarded after a princely fashion hum drum and kopy keck applied themselves to their physics and metaphysics but in vain not even they could suggest a cause now the fact was that the old princess was at the root of the mischief when she heard that her niece found more pleasure in the water than any one else out of it she went into a rage and cursed herself for her want of foresight but said she i will soon set all right the king and the people shall die of thirst their"
