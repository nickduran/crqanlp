"1" "seemed to me to be all talking together lord john was still struggling with his buffalo story so far as i could make out while once again i heard as of old the deep rumble of challenger and the insistent accents of summerlee as their brains locked in high and fierce scientific debate suddenly austin slanted his mahogany face toward me without taking his eyes from his steering wheel i'm under notice said he dear me said i everything seemed strange to day everyone said queer unexpected things it was like a dream it's forty seven times said austin reflectively when do you go i asked for want of some better observation i don't go said austin the conversation seemed to have ended there but presently he came back to it if i was to go who would look after im he jerked his head toward his master who would e get to serve im someone else i suggested lamely not e no one would stay a week if i was to go that ouse would run down like a watch with the mainspring out i'm telling you because you're is friend and you ought to know if i was to take im at is word but there i wouldn't have the eart e and the missus would be like two babes left out in a bundle i'm just everything and then e goes and gives me notice why would no one stay i asked well they wouldn't make allowances same as i do e's a very clever man the master so clever that e's clean balmy sometimes i've seen im right off is onion and no error well look what e did this morning what did he do austin bent over to me e bit the ousekeeper said he in a hoarse whisper bit her yes sir bit er on the leg i saw er with my own eyes startin a marathon from the all door good gracious so you'd say sir if you could see some of the goings on e don't make friends with the neighbors there's some of them thinks that when e was up among those monsters you wrote about it was just ome sweet ome for the master and e was never in fitter company that's what _they_ say but i've served im ten years and i'm fond of im and mind you e's a great man when all's said an done and it's an honor to serve im but e does try one cruel at times now look at that sir that ain't what you might call old fashioned ospitality is it now just you read it for yourself the car on its lowest speed had ground its way up a steep curving ascent at the corner a notice board peered over a well clipped hedge as austin said it was not difficult to read for the words were few and arresting warning visitors pressmen and mendicants are not encouraged g e challenger no it's not what you might call earty said austin shaking his head and glancing up at the deplorable placard it wouldn't look well in a christmas card i beg your pardon sir for i haven't spoke as much as this for many a long year but to day my feelings seem to ave got the better of me e can sack me till e's blue in the face but i ain't going and that's flat i'm is man and e's my master and so it will be i expect to the end of the chapter we had passed between the white posts of a gate and up a curving drive lined with rhododendron bushes beyond stood a low brick house picked out with white woodwork very comfortable and pretty mrs challenger a small dainty smiling figure stood in the open doorway to welcome us well my dear said challenger bustling out of the car here are our visitors it is something new for us to have visitors is it not no love lost between us and our neighbors is there if they could get rat poison into our baker's cart i expect it would be there it's dreadful dreadful cried the lady between laughter and tears george is always quarreling with everyone we haven't a friend on the countryside it enables me to concentrate my attention upon my incomparable wife said challenger passing his short thick arm round her waist picture a gorilla and a gazelle and you have the pair of them come come these gentlemen are tired from the journey and luncheon should be ready has sarah returned the lady shook her head ruefully and the professor laughed loudly and stroked his beard in his masterful fashion austin he cried when you have put up the car you will kindly help your mistress to lay the lunch now gentlemen will you please step into my study for there are one or two very urgent things which i am anxious to say to you chapter ii the tide of death as we crossed the hall the telephone bell rang and we were the involuntary auditors of professor challenger's end of the ensuing dialogue i say we but no one within a hundred yards could have failed to hear the booming of that monstrous voice which reverberated through the house his answers lingered in my mind yes yes of course it is i yes certainly _the_ professor challenger the famous professor who else of course every word of it otherwise i should not have written it i shouldn't be surprised there is every indication of it within a day or so at the furthest well i can't help that can i very unpleasant no doubt but i rather fancy it will affect more important people than you there is no use whining about it no i couldn't possibly you must take your chance that's enough sir nonsense i have something more important to do than to listen to such twaddle he shut off with a crash and led us upstairs into a large airy apartment which formed his study on the great mahogany desk seven or eight unopened telegrams were lying really he said as he gathered them up i begin to think that it would save my correspondents money if i were to adopt a telegraphic address possibly noah rotherfield would be the most appropriate as usual when he made an obscure joke he leaned against the desk and bellowed in a paroxysm of laughter his hands shaking so that he could hardly open the envelopes noah noah he gasped with a face of beetroot while lord john and i smiled in sympathy and summerlee like a dyspeptic goat wagged his head in sardonic disagreement finally challenger still rumbling and exploding began to open his telegrams the three of us stood in the bow window and occupied ourselves in admiring the magnificent view it was certainly worth looking at the road in its gentle curves had really brought us to a considerable elevation seven hundred feet as we afterwards discovered challenger's house was on the very edge of the hill and from its southern face in which was the study window one looked across the vast stretch of the weald to where the gentle curves of the south downs formed an undulating horizon in a cleft of the hills a haze of smoke marked the position of lewes immediately at our feet there lay a rolling plain of heather with the long vivid green stretches of the crowborough golf course all dotted with the players a little to the south through an opening in the woods we could see a section of the main line from london to brighton in the immediate foreground under our very noses was a small enclosed yard in which stood the car which had brought us from the station an ejaculation from challenger caused us to turn he had read his telegrams and had arranged them in a little methodical pile upon his desk his broad rugged face or as much of it as was visible over the matted beard was still deeply flushed and he seemed to be under the influence of some strong excitement well gentlemen he said in a voice as if he was addressing a public meeting this is indeed an interesting reunion and it takes place under extraordinary i may say unprecedented circumstances may i ask if you have observed anything upon your journey from town the only thing which i observed said summerlee with a sour smile was that our young friend here has not improved in his manners during the years that have passed i am sorry to state that i have had to seriously complain of his conduct in the train and i should be wanting in frankness if i did not say that it has left a most unpleasant impression in my mind well well we all get a bit prosy sometimes said lord john the young fellah meant no real harm after all he's an international so if he takes half an hour to describe a game of football he has more right to do it than most folk half an hour to describe a game i cried indignantly why it was you that took half an hour with some long winded story about a buffalo professor summerlee will be my witness i can hardly judge which of you was the most utterly wearisome said summerlee i declare to you challenger that i never wish to hear of football or of buffaloes so long as i live i have never said one word to day about football i protested lord john gave a shrill whistle and summerlee shook his head sadly so early in the day too said he it is indeed deplorable as i sat there in sad but thoughtful silence in silence cried lord john why you were doin a music hall turn of imitations all the way more like a runaway gramophone than a man summerlee drew himself up in bitter protest you are pleased to be facetious lord john said he with a face of vinegar why dash it all this is clear madness cried lord john each of us seems to know what the others did and none of us knows what he did himself let's put it all together from the first we got into a first class smoker that's clear ain't it then we began to quarrel over friend challenger's letter in the times oh you did did you rumbled our host his eyelids beginning to droop you said summerlee that there was no possible truth in his contention dear me said challenger puffing out his chest and stroking his beard no possible truth i seem to have heard the words before and may i ask with what arguments the great and famous professor summerlee proceeded to demolish the humble individual who had ventured to express an opinion upon a matter of scientific possibility perhaps before he exterminates that unfortunate nonentity he will condescend to give some reasons for the adverse views which he has formed he bowed and shrugged and spread open his hands as he spoke with his elaborate and elephantine sarcasm the reason was simple enough said the dogged summerlee i contended that if the ether surrounding the earth was so toxic in one quarter that it produced dangerous symptoms it was hardly likely that we three in the railway carriage should be entirely unaffected the explanation only brought uproarious merriment from challenger he laughed until everything in the room seemed to rattle and quiver our worthy summerlee is not for the first time somewhat out of touch with the facts of the situation said he at last mopping his heated brow now gentlemen i cannot make my point better than by detailing to you what i have myself done this morning you will the more easily condone any mental aberration upon your own part when you realize that even i have had moments when my balance has been disturbed we have had for some years in this household a housekeeper one sarah with whose second name i have never attempted to burden my memory she is a woman of a severe and forbidding aspect prim and demure in her bearing very impassive in her nature and never known within our experience to show signs of any emotion as i sat alone at my breakfast mrs challenger is in the habit of keeping her room of a morning it suddenly entered my head that it would be entertaining and instructive to see whether i could find any limits to this woman's inperturbability i devised a simple but effective experiment having upset a small vase of flowers which stood in the centre of the cloth i rang the bell and slipped under the table she entered and seeing the room empty imagined that i had withdrawn to the study as i had expected she approached and leaned over the table to replace the vase i had a vision of a cotton stocking and an elastic sided boot protruding my head i sank my teeth into the calf of her leg the experiment was successful beyond belief for some moments she stood paralyzed staring down at my head then with a shriek she tore herself free and rushed from the room i pursued her with some thoughts of an explanation but she flew down the drive and some minutes afterwards i was able to pick her out with my field glasses travelling very rapidly in a south westerly direction i tell you the anecdote for what it is worth i drop it into your brains and await its germination is it illuminative has it conveyed anything to your minds what do _you_ think of it lord john lord john shook his head gravely you'll be gettin into serious trouble some of these days if you don't put a brake on said he perhaps you have some observation to make summerlee you should drop all work instantly challenger and take three months in a german watering place said he profound profound cried challenger now my young friend is it possible that wisdom may come from you where your seniors have so signally failed and it did i say it with all modesty but it did of course it all seems obvious enough to you who know what occurred but it was not so very clear when everything was new but it came on me suddenly with the full force of absolute conviction poison i cried then even as i said the word my mind flashed back over the whole morning's experiences past lord john with his buffalo past my own hysterical tears past the outrageous conduct of professor summerlee to the queer happenings in london the row in the park the driving of the chauffeur the quarrel at the oxygen warehouse everything fitted suddenly into its place of course i cried again it is poison we are all poisoned exactly said challenger rubbing his hands we are all poisoned our planet has swum into the poison belt of ether and is now flying deeper into it at the rate of some millions of miles a minute our young friend has expressed the cause of all our troubles and perplexities in a single word poison we looked at each other in amazed silence no comment seemed to meet the situation there is a mental inhibition by which such symptoms can be checked and controlled said challenger i cannot expect to find it developed in all of you to the same point which it has reached in me for i suppose that the strength of our different mental processes bears some proportion to each other but no doubt it is appreciable even in our young friend here after the little outburst of high spirits which so alarmed my domestic i sat down and reasoned with myself i put it to myself that i had never before felt impelled to bite any of my household the impulse had then been an abnormal one in an instant i perceived the truth my pulse upon examination was ten beats above the usual and my reflexes were increased i called upon my higher and saner self the real g e c seated serene and impregnable behind all mere molecular disturbance i summoned him i say to watch the foolish mental tricks which the poison would play i found that i was indeed the master i could recognize and control a disordered mind it was a remarkable exhibition of the victory of mind over matter for it was a victory over that particular form of matter which is most intimately connected with mind i might almost say that mind was at fault and that personality controlled it thus when my wife came downstairs and i was impelled to slip behind the door and alarm her by some wild cry as she entered i was able to stifle the impulse and to greet her with dignity and restraint an overpowering desire to quack like a duck was met and mastered in the same fashion later when i descended to order the car and found austin bending over it absorbed in repairs i controlled my open hand even after i had lifted it and refrained from giving him an experience which would possibly have caused him to follow in the steps of the housekeeper on the contrary i touched him on the shoulder and ordered the car to be at the door in time to meet your train at the present instant i am most forcibly tempted to take professor summerlee by that silly old beard of his and to shake his head violently backwards and forwards and yet as you see i am perfectly restrained let me commend my example to you i'll look out for that buffalo said lord john and i for the football match it may be that you are right challenger said summerlee in a chastened voice i am willing to admit that my turn of mind is critical rather than constructive and that i am not a ready convert to any new theory especially when it happens to be so unusual and fantastic as this one however as i cast my mind back over the events of the morning and as i reconsider the fatuous conduct of my companions i find it easy to believe that some poison of an exciting kind was responsible for their symptoms challenger slapped his colleague good humouredly upon the shoulder we progress said he decidedly we progress and pray sir asked summerlee humbly what is your opinion as to the present outlook with your permission i will say a few words upon that subject he seated himself upon his desk his short stumpy legs swinging in front of him we are assisting at a tremendous and awful function it is in my opinion the end of the world the end of the world our eyes turned to the great bow window and we looked out at the summer beauty of the country side the long slopes of heather the great country houses the cozy farms the pleasure seekers upon the links the end of the world one had often heard the words but the idea that they could ever have an immediate practical significance that it should not be at some vague date but now to day that was a tremendous a staggering thought we were all struck solemn and waited in silence for challenger to continue his overpowering presence and appearance lent such force to the solemnity of his words that for a moment all the crudities and absurdities of the man vanished and he loomed before us as something majestic and beyond the range of ordinary humanity then to me at least there came back the cheering recollection of how twice since we had entered the room he had roared with laughter surely i thought there are limits to mental detachment the crisis cannot be so great or so pressing after all you will conceive a bunch of grapes said he which are covered by some infinitesimal but noxious bacillus the gardener passes it through a disinfecting medium it may be that he desires his grapes to be cleaner it may be that he needs space to breed some fresh bacillus less noxious than the last he dips it into the poison and they are gone our gardener is in my opinion about to dip the solar system and the human bacillus the little mortal vibrio which twisted and wriggled upon the outer rind of the earth will in an instant be sterilized out of existence again there was silence it was broken by the high trill of the telephone bell there is one of our bacilli squeaking for help said he with a grim smile they are beginning to realize that their continued existence is not really one of the necessities of the universe he was gone from the room for a minute or two i remember that none of us spoke in his absence the situation seemed beyond all words or comments the medical officer of health for brighton said he when he returned the symptoms are for some reason developing more rapidly upon the sea level our seven hundred feet of elevation give us an advantage folk seem to have learned that i am the first authority upon the question no doubt it comes from my letter in the times that was the mayor of a provincial town with whom i talked when we first arrived you may have heard me upon the telephone he seemed to put an entirely inflated value upon his own life i helped him to readjust his ideas summerlee had risen and was standing by the window his thin bony hands were trembling with his emotion challenger said he earnestly this thing is too serious for mere futile argument do not suppose that i desire to irritate you by any question i may ask but i put it to you whether there may not be some fallacy in your information or in your reasoning there is the sun shining as brightly as ever in the blue sky there are the heather and the flowers and the birds there are the folk enjoying themselves upon the golf links and the laborers yonder cutting the corn you tell us that they and we may be upon the very brink of destruction that this sunlit day may be that day of doom which the human race has so long awaited so far as we know you found this tremendous judgment upon what upon some abnormal lines in a spectrum upon rumours from sumatra upon some curious personal excitement which we have discerned in each other this latter symptom is not so marked but that you and we could by a deliberate effort control it you need not stand on ceremony with us challenger we have all faced death together before now speak out and let us know exactly where we stand and what in your opinion are our prospects for our future it was a brave good speech a speech from that stanch and strong spirit which lay behind all the acidities and angularities of the old zoologist lord john rose and shook him by the hand my sentiment to a tick said he now challenger it's up to you to tell us where we are we ain't nervous folk as you know well but when it comes to makin a week end visit and finding you've run full butt into the day of judgment it wants a bit of explainin what's the danger and how much of it is there and what are we goin to do to meet it he stood tall and strong in the sunshine at the window with his brown hand upon the shoulder of summerlee i was lying back in an armchair an extinguished cigarette between my lips in that sort of half dazed state in which impressions become exceedingly distinct it may have been a new phase of the poisoning but the delirious promptings had all passed away and were succeeded by an exceedingly languid and at the same time perceptive state of mind i was a spectator it did not seem to be any personal concern of mine but here were three strong men at a great crisis and it was fascinating to observe them challenger bent his heavy brows and stroked his beard before he answered one could see that he was very carefully weighing his words what was the last news when you left london he asked i was at the gazette office about ten said i there was a reuter just come in from singapore to the effect that the sickness seemed to be universal in sumatra and that the lighthouses had not been lit in consequence events have been moving somewhat rapidly since then said challenger picking up his pile of telegrams i am in close touch both with the authorities and with the press so that news is converging upon me from all parts there is in fact a general and very insistent demand that i should come to london but i see no good end to be served from the accounts the poisonous effect begins with mental excitement the rioting in paris this morning is said to have been very violent and the welsh colliers are in a state of uproar so far as the evidence to hand can be trusted this stimulative stage which varies much in races and in individuals is succeeded by a certain exaltation and mental lucidity i seem to discern some signs of it in our young friend here which after an appreciable interval turns to coma deepening rapidly into death i fancy so far as my toxicology carries me that there are some vegetable nerve poisons datura suggested summerlee excellent cried challenger it would make for scientific precision if we named our toxic agent let it be daturon to you my dear summerlee belongs the honour posthumous alas but none the less unique of having given a name to the universal destroyer the great gardener's disinfectant the symptoms of daturon then may be taken to be such as i indicate that it will involve the whole world and that no life can possibly remain behind seems to me to be certain since ether is a universal medium up to now it has been capricious in the places which it has attacked but the difference is only a matter of a few hours and it is like an advancing tide which covers one strip of sand and then another running hither and thither in irregular streams until at last it has submerged it all there are laws at work in connection with the action and distribution of daturon which would have been of deep interest had the time at our disposal permitted us to study them so far as i can trace them here he glanced over his telegrams the less developed races have been the first to respond to its influence there are deplorable accounts from africa and the australian aborigines appear to have been already exterminated the northern races have as yet shown greater resisting power than the southern this you see is dated from marseilles at nine forty five this morning i give it to you verbatim all night delirious excitement throughout provence tumult of vine growers at nimes socialistic upheaval at toulon sudden illness attended by coma attacked population this morning _peste foudroyante_ great numbers of dead in the streets paralysis of business and universal chaos an hour later came the following from the same source we are threatened with utter extermination cathedrals and churches full to overflowing the dead outnumber the living it is inconceivable and horrible decease seems to be painless but swift and inevitable there is a similar telegram from paris where the development is not yet as acute india and persia appear to be utterly wiped out the slavonic population of austria is down while the teutonic has hardly been affected speaking generally the dwellers upon the plains and upon the seashore seem so far as my limited information goes to have felt the effects more rapidly than those inland or on the heights even a little elevation makes a considerable difference and perhaps if there be a survivor of the human race he will again be found upon the summit of some ararat even our own little hill may presently prove to be a temporary island amid a sea of disaster but at the present rate of advance a few short hours will submerge us all lord john roxton wiped his brow what beats me said he is how you could sit there laughin with that stack of telegrams under your hand i've seen death as often as most folk but universal death it's awful as to the laughter said challenger you will bear in mind that like yourselves i have not been exempt from the stimulating cerebral effects of the etheric poison but as to the horror with which universal death appears to inspire you i would put it to you that it is somewhat exaggerated if you were sent to sea alone in an open boat to some unknown destination your heart might well sink within you the isolation the uncertainty would oppress you but if your voyage were made in a goodly ship which bore within it all your relations and your friends you would feel that however uncertain your destination might still remain you would at least have one common and simultaneous experience which would hold you to the end in the same close communion a lonely death may be terrible but a universal one as painless as this would appear to be is not"
