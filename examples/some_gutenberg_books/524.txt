"1" "as if to a caller about the alarming spread of marigolds that summer at the end of the garden a sort of yellow peril to all the smaller hardy annuals while her father brought some papers to table and presented himself as preoccupied with them it really seems as if we shall have to put down marigolds altogether next year aunt molly repeated three times and do away with marguerites they seed beyond all reason elizabeth the parlormaid kept coming in to hand vegetables whenever there seemed a chance of ann veronica asking for an interview directly dinner was over mr stanley having pretended to linger to smoke fled suddenly up stairs to petrography and when veronica tapped he answered through the locked door go away vee i'm busy and made a lapidary's wheel buzz loudly breakfast too was an impossible occasion he read the times with an unusually passionate intentness and then declared suddenly for the earlier of the two trains he used i'll come to the station said ann veronica i may as well come up by this train i may have to run said her father with an appeal to his watch i'll run too she volunteered instead of which they walked sharply i say daddy she began and was suddenly short of breath if it's about that dance project he said it's no good veronica i've made up my mind you'll make me look a fool before all my friends you shouldn't have made an engagement until you'd consulted your aunt i thought i was old enough she gasped between laughter and crying her father's step quickened to a trot i won't have you quarrelling and crying in the avenue he said stop it if you've got anything to say you must say it to your aunt but look here daddy he flapped the times at her with an imperious gesture it's settled you're not to go you're not to go but it's about other things i don't care this isn't the place then may i come to the study to night after dinner i'm busy it's important if i can't talk anywhere else i do want an understanding ahead of them walked a gentleman whom it was evident they must at their present pace very speedily overtake it was ramage the occupant of the big house at the end of the avenue he had recently made mr stanley's acquaintance in the train and shown him one or two trifling civilities he was an outside broker and the proprietor of a financial newspaper he had come up very rapidly in the last few years and mr stanley admired and detested him in almost equal measure it was intolerable to think that he might overhear words and phrases mr stanley's pace slackened you've no right to badger me like this veronica he said i can't see what possible benefit can come of discussing things that are settled if you want advice your aunt is the person however if you must air your opinions to night then daddy he made an angry but conceivably an assenting noise and then ramage glanced back and stopped saluted elaborately and waited for them to come up he was a square faced man of nearly fifty with iron gray hair a mobile clean shaven mouth and rather protuberant black eyes that now scrutinized ann veronica he dressed rather after the fashion of the west end than the city and affected a cultured urbanity that somehow disconcerted and always annoyed ann veronica's father extremely he did not play golf but took his exercise on horseback which was also unsympathetic stuffy these trees make the avenue said mr stanley as they drew alongside to account for his own ruffled and heated expression they ought to have been lopped in the spring there's plenty of time said ramage is miss stanley coming up with us i go second she said and change at wimbledon we'll all go second said ramage if we may mr stanley wanted to object strongly but as he could not immediately think how to put it he contented himself with a grunt and the motion was carried how's mrs ramage he asked very much as usual said ramage she finds lying up so much very irksome but you see she has to lie up the topic of his invalid wife bored him and he turned at once to ann veronica and where are you going he said are you going on again this winter with that scientific work of yours it's an instance of heredity i suppose for a moment mr stanley almost liked ramage you're a biologist aren't you he began to talk of his own impressions of biology as a commonplace magazine reader who had to get what he could from the monthly reviews and was glad to meet with any information from nearer the fountainhead in a little while he and she were talking quite easily and agreeably they went on talking in the train it seemed to her father a slight want of deference to him and he listened and pretended to read the times he was struck disagreeably by ramage's air of gallant consideration and ann veronica's self possessed answers these things did not harmonize with his conception of the forthcoming if unavoidable interview after all it came to him suddenly as a harsh discovery that she might be in a sense regarded as grownup he was a man who in all things classified without nuance and for him there were in the matter of age just two feminine classes and no more girls and women the distinction lay chiefly in the right to pat their heads but here was a girl she must be a girl since she was his daughter and pat able imitating the woman quite remarkably and cleverly he resumed his listening she was discussing one of those modern advanced plays with a remarkable with an extraordinary confidence his love making she remarked struck me as unconvincing he seemed too noisy the full significance of her words did not instantly appear to him then it dawned good heavens she was discussing love making for a time he heard no more and stared with stony eyes at a book war proclamation in leaded type that filled half a column of the times that day could she understand what she was talking about luckily it was a second class carriage and the ordinary fellow travellers were not there everybody he felt must be listening behind their papers of course girls repeat phrases and opinions of which they cannot possibly understand the meaning but a middle aged man like ramage ought to know better than to draw out a girl the daughter of a friend and neighbor well after all he seemed to be turning the subject broddick is a heavy man he was saying and the main interest of the play was the embezzlement thank heaven mr stanley allowed his paper to drop a little and scrutinized the hats and brows of their three fellow travellers they reached wimbledon and ramage whipped out to hand miss stanley to the platform as though she had been a duchess and she descended as though such attentions from middle aged but still gallant merchants were a matter of course then as ramage readjusted himself in a corner he remarked these young people shoot up stanley it seems only yesterday that she was running down the avenue all hair and legs mr stanley regarded him through his glasses with something approaching animosity now she's all hat and ideas he said with an air of humor she seems an unusually clever girl said ramage mr stanley regarded his neighbor's clean shaven face almost warily i'm not sure whether we don't rather overdo all this higher education he said with an effect of conveying profound meanings part 6 he became quite sure by a sort of accumulation of reflection as the day wore on he found his youngest daughter intrusive in his thoughts all through the morning and still more so in the afternoon he saw her young and graceful back as she descended from the carriage severely ignoring him and recalled a glimpse he had of her face bright and serene as his train ran out of wimbledon he recalled with exasperating perplexity her clear matter of fact tone as she talked about love making being unconvincing he was really very proud of her and extraordinarily angry and resentful at the innocent and audacious self reliance that seemed to intimate her sense of absolute independence of him her absolute security without him after all she only looked a woman she was rash and ignorant absolutely inexperienced absolutely he began to think of speeches very firm explicit speeches he would make he lunched in the legal club in chancery lane and met ogilvy daughters were in the air that day ogilvy was full of a client's trouble in that matter a grave and even tragic trouble he told some of the particulars curious case said ogilvy buttering his bread and cutting it up in a way he had curious case and sets one thinking he resumed after a mouthful here is a girl of sixteen or seventeen seventeen and a half to be exact running about as one might say in london schoolgirl her family are solid west end people kensington people father dead she goes out and comes home afterward goes on to oxford twenty one twenty two why doesn't she marry plenty of money under her father's will charming girl he consumed irish stew for some moments married already he said with his mouth full shopman good god said mr stanley good looking rascal she met at worthing very romantic and all that he fixed it but he left her alone pure romantic nonsense on her part sheer calculation on his went up to somerset house to examine the will before he did it yes nice position she doesn't care for him now not a bit what a girl of sixteen cares for is hair and a high color and moonlight and a tenor voice i suppose most of our daughters would marry organ grinders if they had a chance at that age my son wanted to marry a woman of thirty in a tobacconist's shop only a son's another story we fixed that well that's the situation my people don't know what to do can't face a scandal can't ask the gent to go abroad and condone a bigamy he misstated her age and address but you can't get home on him for a thing like that there you are girl spoilt for life makes one want to go back to the oriental system mr stanley poured wine damned rascal he said isn't there a brother to kick him mere satisfaction reflected ogilvy mere sensuality i rather think they have kicked him from the tone of some of the letters nice of course but it doesn't alter the situation it's these rascals said mr stanley and paused always has been said ogilvy our interest lies in heading them off there was a time when girls didn't get these extravagant ideas lydia languish for example anyhow they didn't run about so much yes that's about the beginning it's these damned novels all this torrent of misleading spurious stuff that pours from the press these sham ideals and advanced notions women who dids and all that kind of thing ogilvy reflected this girl she's really a very charming frank person had had her imagination fired so she told me by a school performance of romeo and juliet mr stanley decided to treat that as irrelevant there ought to be a censorship of books we want it badly at the present time even with the censorship of plays there's hardly a decent thing to which a man can take his wife and daughters a creeping taint of suggestion everywhere what would it be without that safeguard ogilvy pursued his own topic i'm inclined to think stanley myself that as a matter of fact it was the expurgated romeo and juliet did the mischief if our young person hadn't had the nurse part cut out eh she might have known more and done less i was curious about that all they left it was the moon and stars and the balcony and my romeo shakespeare is altogether different from the modern stuff altogether different i'm not discussing shakespeare i don't want to bowdlerize shakespeare i'm not that sort i quite agree but this modern miasma mr stanley took mustard savagely well we won't go into shakespeare said ogilvy what interests me is that our young women nowadays are running about as free as air practically with registry offices and all sorts of accommodation round the corner nothing to check their proceedings but a declining habit of telling the truth and the limitations of their imaginations and in that respect they stir up one another not my affair of course but i think we ought to teach them more or restrain them more one or the other they're too free for their innocence or too innocent for their freedom that's my point are you going to have any apple tart stanley the apple tart's been very good lately very good part 7 at the end of dinner that evening ann veronica began father her father looked at her over his glasses and spoke with grave deliberation if there is anything you want to say to me he said you must say it in the study i am going to smoke a little here and then i shall go to the study i don't see what you can have to say i should have thought my note cleared up everything there are some papers i have to look through to night important papers i won't keep you very long daddy said ann veronica i don't see mollie he remarked taking a cigar from the box on the table as his sister and daughter rose why you and vee shouldn't discuss this little affair whatever it is without bothering me it was the first time this controversy had become triangular for all three of them were shy by habit he stopped in mid sentence and ann veronica opened the door for her aunt the air was thick with feelings her aunt went out of the room with dignity and a rustle and up stairs to the fastness of her own room she agreed entirely with her brother it distressed and confused her that the girl should not come to her it seemed to show a want of affection to be a deliberate and unmerited disregard to justify the reprisal of being hurt when ann veronica came into the study she found every evidence of a carefully foreseen grouping about the gas fire both arm chairs had been moved a little so as to face each other on either side of the fender and in the circular glow of the green shaded lamp there lay conspicuously waiting a thick bundle of blue and white papers tied with pink tape her father held some printed document in his hand and appeared not to observe her entry sit down he said and perused perused is the word for it for some moments then he put the paper by and what is it all about veronica he asked with a deliberate note of irony looking at her a little quizzically over his glasses ann veronica looked bright and a little elated and she disregarded her father's invitation to be seated she stood on the mat instead and looked down on him look here daddy she said in a tone of great reasonableness i must go to that dance you know her father's irony deepened why he asked suavely her answer was not quite ready well because i don't see any reason why i shouldn't you see i do why shouldn't i go it isn't a suitable place it isn't a suitable gathering but daddy what do you know of the place and the gathering and it's entirely out of order it isn't right it isn't correct it's impossible for you to stay in an hotel in london the idea is preposterous i can't imagine what possessed you veronica he put his head on one side pulled down the corners of his mouth and looked at her over his glasses but why is it preposterous asked ann veronica and fiddled with a pipe on the mantel surely he remarked with an expression of worried appeal you see daddy i don't think it is preposterous that's really what i want to discuss it comes to this am i to be trusted to take care of myself or am i not to judge from this proposal of yours i should say not i think i am as long as you remain under my roof he began and paused you are going to treat me as though i wasn't well i don't think that's fair your ideas of fairness he remarked and discontinued that sentence my dear girl he said in a tone of patient reasonableness you are a mere child you know nothing of life nothing of its dangers nothing of its possibilities you think everything is harmless and simple and so forth it isn't it isn't that's where you go wrong in some things in many things you must trust to your elders to those who know more of life than you do your aunt and i have discussed all this matter there it is you can't go the conversation hung for a moment ann veronica tried to keep hold of a complicated situation and not lose her head she had turned round sideways so as to look down into the fire you see father she said it isn't only this affair of the dance i want to go to that because it's a new experience because i think it will be interesting and give me a view of things you say i know nothing that's probably true but how am i to know of things some things i hope you may never know he said i'm not so sure i want to know just as much as i can tut he said fuming and put out his hand to the papers in the pink tape well i do it's just that i want to say i want to be a human being i want to learn about things and know about things and not to be protected as something too precious for life cooped up in one narrow little corner cooped up he cried did i stand in the way of your going to college have i ever prevented you going about at any reasonable hour you've got a bicycle h'm said ann veronica and then went on i want to be taken seriously a girl at my age is grown up i want to go on with my university work under proper conditions now that i've done the intermediate it isn't as though i haven't done well i've never muffed an exam yet roddy muffed two her father interrupted now look here veronica let us be plain with each other you are not going to that infidel russell's classes you are not going anywhere but to the tredgold college i've thought that out and you must make up your mind to it all sorts of considerations come in while you live in my house you must follow my ideas you are wrong even about that man's scientific position and his standard of work there are men in the lowndean who laugh at him simply laugh at him and i have seen work by his pupils myself that struck me as being well next door to shameful there's stories too about his demonstrator capes something or other the kind of man who isn't content with his science and writes articles in the monthly reviews anyhow there it is you are not going there the girl received this intimation in silence but the face that looked down upon the gas fire took an expression of obstinacy that brought out a hitherto latent resemblance between parent and child when she spoke her lips twitched then i suppose when i have graduated i am to come home it seems the natural course and do nothing there are plenty of things a girl can find to do at home until some one takes pity on me and marries me he raised his eyebrows in mild appeal his foot tapped impatiently and he took up the papers look here father she said with a change in her voice suppose i won't stand it he regarded her as though this was a new idea suppose for example i go to this dance you won't well her breath failed her for a moment how would you prevent it she asked but i have forbidden it he said raising his voice yes i know but suppose i go now veronica no no this won't do understand me i forbid it i do not want to hear from you even the threat of disobedience he spoke loudly the thing is forbidden i am ready to give up anything that you show to be wrong you will give up anything i wish you to give up they stared at each other through a pause and both faces were flushed and obstinate she was trying by some wonderful secret and motionless gymnastics to restrain her tears but when she spoke her lips quivered and they came i mean to go to that dance she blubbered i mean to go to that dance i meant to reason with you but you won't reason you're dogmatic at the sight of her tears his expression changed to a mingling of triumph and concern he stood up apparently intending to put an arm about her but she stepped back from him quickly she produced a handkerchief and with one sweep of this and a simultaneous gulp had abolished her fit of weeping his voice now had lost its ironies now veronica he pleaded veronica this is most unreasonable all we do is for your good neither your aunt nor i have any other thought but what is best for you only you won't let me live only you won't let me exist mr stanley lost patience he bullied frankly what nonsense is this what raving my dear child you do live you do exist you have this home you have friends acquaintances social standing brothers and sisters every advantage instead of which you want to go to some mixed classes or other and cut up rabbits and dance about at nights in wild costumes with casual art student friends and god knows who that that isn't living you are beside yourself you don't know what you ask nor what you say you have neither reason nor logic i am sorry to seem to hurt you but all i say is for your good you must not you shall not go on this i am resolved i put my foot down like like adamant and a time will come veronica mark my words a time will come when you will bless me for my firmness to night it goes to my heart to disappoint you but this thing must not be he sidled toward her but she recoiled from him leaving him in possession of the hearth rug well she said good night father what he asked not a kiss she affected not to hear the door closed softly upon her for a long time he remained standing before the fire staring at the situation then he sat down and filled his pipe slowly and thoughtfully i don't see what else i could have said he remarked chapter the second ann veronica gathers points of view part 1 are you coming to the fadden dance ann veronica asked constance widgett ann veronica considered her answer i mean to she replied you are making your dress such as it is they were in the elder widgett girl's bedroom hetty was laid up she said with a sprained ankle and a miscellaneous party was gossiping away her tedium it was a large littered self forgetful apartment decorated with unframed charcoal sketches by various incipient masters and an open bookcase surmounted by plaster casts and the half of a human skull displayed an odd miscellany of books shaw and swinburne tom jones fabian essays pope and dumas cheek by jowl constance widgett's abundant copper red hair was bent down over some dimly remunerative work stencilling in colors upon rough white material at a kitchen table she had dragged up stairs for the purpose while on her bed there was seated a slender lady of thirty or so in a dingy green dress whom constance had introduced with a wave of her hand as miss miniver miss miniver looked out on the world through large emotional blue eyes that were further magnified by the glasses she wore and her nose was pinched and pink and her mouth was whimsically petulant her glasses moved quickly as her glance travelled from face to face she seemed bursting with the desire to talk and watching for her opportunity on her lapel was an ivory button bearing the words votes for women ann veronica sat at the foot of the sufferer's bed while teddy widgett being something of an athlete occupied the only bed room chair a decadent piece essentially a tripod and largely a formality and smoked cigarettes and tried to conceal the fact that he was looking all the time at ann veronica's eyebrows teddy was the hatless young man who had turned ann veronica aside from the avenue two days before he was the junior of both his sisters co educated and much broken in to feminine society a bowl of roses just brought by ann veronica adorned the communal dressing table and ann veronica was particularly trim in preparation for a call she was to make with her aunt later in the afternoon ann veronica decided to be more explicit i've been she said forbidden to come hul lo said hetty turning her head on the pillow and teddy remarked with profound emotion my god yes said ann veronica and that complicates the situation auntie asked constance who was conversant with ann veronica's affairs no my father it's it's a serious prohibition why asked hetty that's the point i asked him why and he hadn't a reason you asked your father for a reason said miss miniver with great intensity yes i tried to have it out with him but he wouldn't have it out ann veronica reflected for an instant that's why i think i ought to come you asked your father for a reason miss miniver repeated we always have things out with our father poor dear said hetty he's got almost to like it men said miss miniver never have a reason never and they don't know it they have no idea of it it's one of their worst traits one of their very worst but i say vee said constance if you come and you are forbidden to come there'll be the deuce of a row ann veronica was deciding for further confidences her situation was perplexing her very much and the widgett atmosphere was lax and sympathetic and provocative of discussion it isn't only the dance she said there's the classes said constance the well informed there's the whole situation apparently i'm not to exist yet i'm not to study i'm not to grow i've got to stay at home and remain in a state of suspended animation dusting said miss miniver in a sepulchral voice until you marry vee said hetty well i don't feel like standing it thousands of women have married merely for freedom said miss miniver thousands ugh and found it a worse slavery i suppose said constance stencilling away at bright pink petals it's our lot but it's very beastly what's our lot asked her sister slavery downtroddenness when i think of it i feel all over boot marks men's boots we hide it bravely but so it is damn i've splashed miss miniver's manner became impressive she addressed ann veronica with an air of conveying great open secrets to her as things are at present she said it is true we live under man made institutions and that is what they amount to every girl in the world practically except a few of us who teach or type write and then we're underpaid and sweated it's dreadful to think how we are sweated she had lost her generalization whatever it was she hung for a moment and then went on conclusively until we have the vote that is how things will be i'm all for the vote said teddy i suppose a girl must be underpaid and sweated said ann veronica i suppose there's no way of getting a decent income independently women have practically no economic freedom said miss miniver because they have no political freedom men have seen to that the one profession the one decent profession i mean for a woman except the stage is teaching and there we trample on one another everywhere else the law medicine the stock exchange prejudice bars us there's art said ann veronica and writing every one hasn't the gift even there a woman never gets a fair chance men are against her whatever she does is minimized all the best novels have been written by women and yet see how men sneer at the lady novelist still there's only one way to get on for a woman and that is to please men that is what they think we are for we're beasts said teddy beasts but miss miniver"
