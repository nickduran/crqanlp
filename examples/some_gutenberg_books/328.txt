"1" "fellow good i've seen some chaps who never knew their power until somebody knocked em to the floor i've known men who discovered in an hour a courage they had never shown before i've seen em rise from failure to the top by doin things they hadn't understood before the day disaster made em drop a lickin often does a fellow good success is not the teacher wise an true that gruff old failure is remember that she's much too apt to make a fool of you which isn't true of blows that knock you flat hard knocks are painful things an hard to bear an most of us would dodge em if we could there's something mighty broadening in care a lickin often does a fellow good 44 spring in the trenches it's coming time for planting in that little patch of ground where the lad and i made merry as he followed me around now the sun is getting higher and the skies above are blue and i'm hungry for the garden and i wish the war was through but it's tramp tramp tramp and it's never look behind and when you see a stranger's kids pretend that you are blind the spring is coming back again the birds begin to mate the skies are full of kindness but the world is full of hate and it's i that should be bending now in peace above the soil with laughing eyes and little hands about to bless the toil but it's fight fight fight and it's charge at double quick a soldier thinking thoughts of home is one more soldier sick last year i brought the bulbs to bloom and saw the roses bud this year i'm ankle deep in mire and most of it is blood last year the mother in the door was glad as she could be to day her heart is full of pain and mine is hurting me but it's shoot shoot shoot and when the bullets hiss don't let the tears fill up your eyes for weeping soldiers miss oh who will tend the roses now and who will sow the seeds and who will do the heavy work the little garden needs and who will tell the lad of mine the things he wants to know and take his hand and lead him round the paths we used to go for it's charge charge charge and it's face the foe once more forget the things you love the most and keep your mind on gore 46 father used to wonder just why father never had much time for play used to wonder why he'd rather work each minute of the day used to wonder why he never loafed along the road an shirked can't recall a time whenever father played while others worked father didn't dress in fashion sort of hated clothing new style with him was not a passion he had other things in view boys are blind to much that's going on about em day by day and i had no way of knowing what became of father's pay all i knew was when i needed shoes i got em on the spot everything for which i pleaded somehow father always got wondered season after season why he never took a rest and that _i_ might be the reason then i never even guessed father set a store on knowledge if he'd lived to have his way he'd have sent me off to college and the bills been glad to pay that i know was his ambition now and then he used to say he'd have done his earthly mission on my graduation day saw his cheeks were getting paler didn't understand just why saw his body growing frailer then at last i saw him die rest had come his tasks were ended calm was written on his brow father's life was big and splendid and i understand it now 48 laddies show me the boy who never threw a stone at someone's cat or never hurled a snowball swift at someone's high silk hat who never ran away from school to seek the swimming hole or slyly from a neighbor's yard green apples never stole show me the boy who never broke a pane of window glass who never disobeyed the sign that says keep off the grass who never did a thousand things that grieve us sore to tell and i'll show you a little boy who must be far from well 49 the living beauties i never knew until they went how much their laughter really meant i never knew how much the place depended on each little face how barren home could be and drear without its living beauties here i never knew that chairs and books could wear such sad and solemn looks that rooms and halls could be at night so still and drained of all delight this home is now but brick and board where bits of furniture are stored i used to think i loved each shelf and room for what it was itself and once i thought each picture fine because i proudly called it mine but now i know they mean no more than art works hanging in a store until they went away to roam i never knew what made it home but i have learned that all is base however wonderful the place and decked with costly treasures rare unless the living joys are there 50 at breakfast time my pa he eats his breakfast in a funny sort of way we hardly ever see him at the first meal of the day ma puts his food before him and he settles in his place an then he props the paper up and we can't see his face we hear him blow his coffee and we hear him chew his toast but it's for the morning paper that he seems to care the most ma says that little children mighty grateful ought to be to the folks that fixed the evening as the proper time for tea she says if meals were only served to people once a day an that was in the morning just before pa goes away we'd never know how father looked when he was in his place coz he'd always have the morning paper stuck before his face he drinks his coffee steamin hot an passes ma his cup to have it filled a second time an never once looks up he never has a word to say but just sits there an reads an when she sees his hand stuck out ma gives him what he needs she guesses what it is he wants coz it's no use to ask pa's got to read his paper an sometimes that's quite a task one morning we had breakfast an his features we could see but his face was long an solemn an he didn't speak to me an we couldn't get him laughin an we couldn't make him smile an he said the toast was soggy an the coffee simply vile then ma said what's the matter why are you so cross an glum an pa most took her head off coz the paper didn't come 52 can't _can't_ is the worst word that's written or spoken doing more harm here than slander and lies on it is many a strong spirit broken and with it many a good purpose dies it springs from the lips of the thoughtless each morning and robs us of courage we need through the day it rings in our ears like a timely sent warning and laughs when we falter and fall by the way _can't_ is the father of feeble endeavor the parent of terror and half hearted work it weakens the efforts of artisans clever and makes of the toiler an indolent shirk it poisons the soul of the man with a vision it stifles in infancy many a plan it greets honest toiling with open derision and mocks at the hopes and the dreams of a man _can't_ is a word none should speak without blushing to utter it should be a symbol of shame ambition and courage it daily is crushing it blights a man's purpose and shortens his aim despise it with all of your hatred of error refuse it the lodgment it seeks in your brain arm against it as a creature of terror and all that you dream of you some day shall gain _can't_ is the word that is foe to ambition an enemy ambushed to shatter your will its prey is forever the man with a mission and bows but to courage and patience and skill hate it with hatred that's deep and undying for once it is welcomed twill break any man whatever the goal you are seeking keep trying and answer this demon by saying i _can_ 54 james whitcomb riley _written july 22 1916 when the world lost its poet of childhood there must be great rejoicin on the golden shore to day an the big an little angels must be feelin mighty gay could we look beyond the curtain now i fancy we should see old aunt mary waitin smilin for the coming that's to be an little orphant annie an the whole excited pack dancin up an down an shoutin mr riley's comin back there's a heap o real sadness in this good old world to day there are lumpy throats this morning now that riley's gone away there's a voice now stilled forever that in sweetness only spoke an whispered words of courage with a faith that never broke there is much of joy and laughter that we mortals here will lack but the angels must be happy now that riley's comin back the world was gettin dreary there was too much sigh an frown in this vale o mortal strivin so god sent jim riley down an he said go there an cheer em in your good old fashioned way with your songs of tender sweetness but don't make your plans to stay coz you're needed up in heaven i am lendin you to men just to help em with your music but i'll want you back again an riley came an mortals heard the music of his voice an they caught his songs o beauty an they started to rejoice an they leaned on him in sorrow an they shared with him their joys an they walked with him the pathways that they knew when they were boys but the heavenly angels missed him missed his tender gentle knack of makin people happy an they wanted riley back there must be great rejoicin on the streets of heaven to day an all the angel children must be troopin down the way singin heavenly songs of welcome an preparin now to greet the soul that god had tinctured with an ever lasting sweet the world is robed in sadness an is draped in sombre black but joy must reign in heaven now that riley's comin back 56 results and roses the man who wants a garden fair or small or very big with flowers growing here and there must bend his back and dig the things are mighty few on earth that wishes can attain whate'er we want of any worth we've got to work to gain it matters not what goal you seek its secret here reposes you've got to dig from week to week to get results or roses 57 the other fellow are you fond of your wife and your children fair so is the other fellow do you crave pleasures for them to share so does the other fellow does your heart rejoice when your own are glad and are you troubled when they are sad well it's that way too in this life my lad that way with the other fellow do you want the best for your own to know so does the other fellow do you stoop to kiss them before you go so does the other fellow when your baby lies on a fevered bed does your heart run cold with a silent dread well it's that way too where all mortals tread that way with the other fellow does it hurt when they want what you cannot buy it does with the other fellow do you for their comfort yourself deny so does the other fellow would you wail aloud if your babe should die for the lack of care you could not supply well it's that way too as he travels by that way with the other fellow 58 our duty to our flag less hate and greed is what we need and more of service true more men to love the flag above and keep it first in view less boast and brag about the flag more faith in what it means more heads erect more self respect less talk of war machines the time to fight to keep it bright is not along the way nor cross the foam but here at home within ourselves to day tis we must love that flag above with all our might and main for from our hands not distant lands shall come dishonor's stain if that flag be dishonored we have done it not the foe if it shall fall we first of all shall be to strike a blow 59 the hunter cheek that is tanned to the wind of the north body that jests at the bite of the cold limbs that are eager and strong to go forth into the wilds and the ways of the bold red blood that pulses and throbs in the veins ears that love silences better than noise strength of the forest and health of the plains these the rewards that the hunter enjoys forests were ever the cradles of men manhood is born of a kinship with trees whence shall come brave hearts and stout muscles when woods have made way for our cities of ease oh do you wonder that stalwarts return yearly to hark to the whispering oaks tis for the brave days of old that they yearn these are the splendors the hunter invokes 60 it's september it's september and the orchards are afire with red and gold and the nights with dew are heavy and the morning's sharp with cold now the garden's at its gayest with the salvia blazing red and the good old fashioned asters laughing at us from their bed once again in shoes and stockings are the children's little feet and the dog now does his snoozing on the bright side of the street it's september and the cornstalks are as high as they will go and the red cheeks of the apples everywhere begin to show now the supper's scarcely over ere the darkness settles down and the moon looms big and yellow at the edges of the town oh it's good to see the children when their little prayers are said duck beneath the patchwork covers when they tumble into bed it's september and a calmness and a sweetness seem to fall over everything that's living just as though it hears the call of old winter trudging slowly with his pack of ice and snow in the distance over yonder and it somehow seems as though every tiny little blossom wants to look its very best when the frost shall bite its petals and it droops away to rest it's september it's the fullness and the ripeness of the year all the work of earth is finished or the final tasks are near but there is no doleful wailing every living thing that grows for the end that is approaching wears the finest garb it knows and i pray that i may proudly hold my head up high and smile when i come to my september in the golden afterwhile 62 how do you tackle your work how do you tackle your work each day are you scared of the job you find do you grapple the task that comes your way with a confident easy mind do you stand right up to the work ahead or fearfully pause to view it do you start to toil with a sense of dread or feel that you're going to do it you can do as much as you think you can but you'll never accomplish more if you're afraid of yourself young man there's little for you in store for failure comes from the inside first it's there if we only knew it and you can win though you face the worst if you feel that you're going to do it success it's found in the soul of you and not in the realm of luck the world will furnish the work to do but you must provide the pluck you can do whatever you think you can it's all in the way you view it it's all in the start that you make young man you must feel that you're going to do it how do you tackle your work each day with confidence clear or dread what to yourself do you stop and say when a new task lies ahead what is the thought that is in your mind is fear ever running through it if so just tackle the next you find by thinking you're going to do it 63 life life is a gift to be used every day not to be smothered and hidden away it isn't a thing to be stored in the chest where you gather your keepsakes and treasure your best it isn't a joy to be sipped now and then and promptly put back in a dark place again life is a gift that the humblest may boast of and one that the humblest may well make the most of get out and live it each hour of the day wear it and use it as much as you may don't keep it in niches and corners and grooves you'll find that in service its beauty improves 64 story telling most every night when they're in bed and both their little prayers have said they shout for me to come upstairs and tell them tales of gypsies bold and eagles with the claws that hold a baby's weight and fairy sprites that roam the woods on starry nights and i must illustrate these tales must imitate the northern gales that toss the indian's canoe and show the way he paddles too if in the story comes a bear i have to pause and sniff the air and show the way he climbs the trees to steal the honey from the bees and then i buzz like angry bees and sting him on his nose and knees and howl in pain till mother cries that pair will never shut their eyes while all that noise up there you make you're simply keeping them awake and then they whisper just one more and once again i'm forced to roar new stories every night they ask and that is not an easy task i have to be so many things the frog that croaks the lark that sings the cunning fox the frightened hen but just last night they stumped me when they wanted me to twist and squirm and imitate an angle worm at last they tumble off to sleep and softly from their room i creep and brush and comb the shock of hair i tossed about to be a bear then mother says well i should say you're just as much a child as they but you can bet i'll not resign that story telling job of mine 66 canning time there's a wondrous smell of spices in the kitchen most bewitchin there are fruits cut into slices that just set the palate itchin there's the sound of spoon on platter and the rattle and the clatter and a bunch of kids are hastin to the splendid joy of tastin it's the fragrant time of year when fruit cannin days are here there's a good wife gayly smilin and perspirin some and tirin and while jar on jar she's pilin and the necks o them she's wirin i'm a sittin here an dreamin of the kettles that are steamin and the cares that have been troublin all have vanished in the bubblin i am happy that i'm here at the cannin time of year lord i'm sorry for the feller that is missin all the hissin of the juices red and yeller and can never sit and listen to the rattle and the clatter of the sound of spoon on platter i am sorry for the single for they miss the thrill and tingle of the splendid time of year when the cannin days are here 67 the dull road it's the dull road that leads to the gay road the practice that leads to success the work road that leads to the play road it is trouble that breeds happiness it's the hard work and merciless grinding that purchases glory and fame it's repeatedly doing nor minding the drudgery drear of the game it's the passing up glamor or pleasure for the sake of the skill we may gain and in giving up comfort or leisure for the joy that we hope to attain it's the hard road of trying and learning of toiling uncheered and alone that wins us the prizes worth earning and leads us to goals we would own 68 the apple tree when an apple tree is ready for the world to come and eat there isn't any structure in the land that's got it beat there's nothing man has builded with the beauty or the charm that can touch the simple grandeur of the monarch of the farm there's never any picture from a human being's brush that has ever caught the redness of a single apple's blush when an apple tree's in blossom it is glorious to see but that's just a hint at springtime of the better things to be that is just a fairy promise from the great magician's wand of the wonders and the splendors that are waiting just beyond the distant edge of summer just a forecast of the treat when the apple tree is ready for the world to come and eat architects of splendid vision long have labored on the earth and have raised their dreams in marble and we've marveled at their worth long the spires of costly churches have looked upward at the sky rich in promise and in the beauty they have cheered the passer by but i'm sure there's nothing finer for the eye of man to meet than an apple tree that's ready for the world to come and eat there's the promise of the apples red and gleaming in the sun like the medals worn by mortals as rewards for labors done and the big arms stretched wide open with a welcome warm and true in a way that sets you thinking it's intended just for you there is nothing with a beauty so entrancing so complete as an apple tree that's ready for the world to come and eat 70 the home town some folks leave home for money and some leave home for fame some seek skies always sunny and some depart in shame i care not what the reason men travel east and west or what the month or season the home town is the best the home town is the glad town where something real abides tis not the money mad town that all its spirit hides though strangers scoff and flout it and even jeer its name it has a charm about it no other town can claim the home town skies seem bluer than skies that stretch away the home town friends seem truer and kinder through the day and whether glum or cheery light hearted or depressed or struggle fit or weary i like the home town best let him who will go wander to distant towns to live of some things i am fonder than all they have to give the gold of distant places could not repay me quite for those familiar faces that keep the home town bright 71 take home a smile take home a smile forget the petty cares the dull grim grind of all the day's affairs the day is done come be yourself awhile to night to those who wait take home a smile take home a smile don't scatter grief and gloom where laughter and light hearts should always bloom what though you've traveled many a dusty mile footsore and weary still take home a smile take home a smile it is not much to do but much it means to them who wait for you you can be brave for such a little while the day of doubt is done take home a smile 72 courage courage isn't a brilliant dash a daring deed in a moment's flash it isn't an instantaneous thing born of despair with a sudden spring it isn't a creature of flickered hope or the final tug at a slipping rope but it's something deep in the soul of man that is working always to serve some plan courage isn't the last resort in the work of life or the game of sport it isn't a thing that a man can call at some future time when he's apt to fall if he hasn't it now he will have it not when the strain is great and the pace is hot for who would strive for a distant goal must always have courage within his soul courage isn't a dazzling light that flashes and passes away from sight it's a slow unwavering ingrained trait with the patience to work and the strength to wait it's part of a man when his skies are blue it's part of him when he has work to do the brave man never is freed of it he has it when there is no need of it courage was never designed for show it isn't a thing that can come and go it's written in victory and defeat and every trial a man may meet it's part of his hours his days and his years back of his smiles and behind his tears courage is more than a daring deed it's the breath of life and a strong man's creed 73 greatness we can be great by helping one another we can be loved for very simple deeds who has the grateful mention of a brother has really all the honor that he needs we can be famous for our works of kindness fame is not born alone of strength or skill it sometimes comes from deafness and from blindness to petty words and faults and loving still we can be rich in gentle smiles and sunny a jeweled soul exceeds a royal crown the richest men sometimes have little money and croesus oft's the poorest man in town 74 the epicure i've sipped a rich man's sparkling wine his silverware i've handled i've placed these battered legs of mine neath tables gayly candled i dine on rare and costly fare whene'er good fortune lets me but there's no meal that can compare with those the missus gets me i've had your steaks three inches thick with all your sam ward trimming i've had the breast of milk fed chick in luscious gravy swimming to dine in swell cafe or club but irritates and frets me give me the plain and wholesome grub the grub the missus gets me two kiddies smiling at the board the cook right at the table the four of us a hungry horde to beat that none is able a big meat pie with flaky crust tis then that joy besets me oh i could eat until i bust those meals the missus gets me 75 the gentle gardener i'd like to leave but daffodills to mark my little way to leave but tulips red and white behind me as i stray i'd like to pass away from earth and feel i'd left behind but roses and forget me nots for all who come to find i'd like to sow the barren spots with all the flowers of earth to leave a path where those who come should find but gentle mirth and when at last i'm called upon to join the heavenly throng i'd like to feel along my way i'd left no sign of wrong and yet the cares are many and the hours of toil are few there is not time enough on earth for all i'd like to do but having lived and having toiled i'd like the world to find some little touch of beauty that my soul had left behind 76 the finest age when he was only nine months old and plump and round and pink of cheek a joy to tickle and to hold before he'd even learned to speak his gentle mother used to say it is too bad that he must grow if i could only have my way his baby ways we'd always know and then the year was turned and he began to toddle round the floor and name the things that he could see and soil the dresses that he wore then many a night she whispered low our baby now is such a joy i hate to think that he must grow to be a wild and heedless boy but on he went and sweeter grew and then his mother i recall wished she could keep him always two for that's the finest age of all she thought the selfsame thing at three and now that he is four she sighs to"
