"1" "big boned hammer headed beasts that looked as if they had been taken from plough or waggon but their riders were well armed with steel armour on their heads legs and arms amongst the horsemen i noted the man that had ridden past me when i first awoke but he seemed to be a prisoner as he had a woollen hood on his head instead of his helmet and carried neither bill sword nor dagger he seemed by no means ill at ease however but was laughing and talking with the men who stood near him above the heads of the crowd and now slowly working towards the cross was a banner on a high raised cross pole a picture of a man and woman half clad in skins of beasts seen against a background of green trees the man holding a spade and the woman a distaff and spindle rudely done enough but yet with a certain spirit and much meaning and underneath this symbol of the early world and man's first contest with nature were the written words when adam delved and eve span who was then the gentleman the banner came on and through the crowd which at last opened where we stood for its passage and the banner bearer turned and faced the throng and stood on the first step of the cross beside me a man followed him clad in a long dark brown gown of coarse woollen girt with a cord to which hung a pair of beads or rosary as we should call it to day and a book in a bag the man was tall and big boned a ring of dark hair surrounded his priest's tonsure his nose was big but clear cut and with wide nostrils his shaven face showed a longish upper lip and a big but blunt chin his mouth was big and the lips closed firmly a face not very noteworthy but for his grey eyes well opened and wide apart at whiles lighting up his whole face with a kindly smile at whiles set and stern at whiles resting in that look as if they were gazing at something a long way off which is the wont of the eyes of the poet or enthusiast he went slowly up the steps of the cross and stood at the top with one hand laid on the shaft and shout upon shout broke forth from the throng when the shouting died away into a silence of the human voices the bells were still quietly chiming with that far away voice of theirs and the long winged dusky swifts by no means scared by the concourse swung round about the cross with their wild squeals and the man stood still for a little eyeing the throng or rather looking first at one and then another man in it as though he were trying to think what such an one was thinking of or what he were fit for sometimes he caught the eye of one or other and then that kindly smile spread over his face but faded off it into the sternness and sadness of a man who has heavy and great thoughts hanging about him but when john ball first mounted the steps of the cross a lad at some one's bidding had run off to stop the ringers and so presently the voice of the bells fell dead leaving on men's minds that sense of blankness or even disappointment which is always caused by the sudden stopping of a sound one has got used to and found pleasant but a great expectation had fallen by now on all that throng and no word was spoken even in a whisper and all men's hearts and eyes were fixed upon the dark figure standing straight up now by the tall white shaft of the cross his hands stretched out before him one palm laid upon the other and for me as i made ready to hearken i felt a joy in my soul that i had never yet felt chapter iv the voice of john ball so now i heard john ball how he lifted up his voice and said ho all ye good people i am a priest of god and in my day's work it cometh that i should tell you what ye should do and what ye should forbear doing and to that end i am come hither yet first if i myself have wronged any man here let him say wherein my wrongdoing lieth that i may ask his pardon and his pity a great hum of good will ran through the crowd as he spoke then he smiled as in a kind of pride and again he spoke wherefore did ye take me out of the archbishop's prison but three days agone when ye lighted the archbishop's house for the candle of canterbury but that i might speak to you and pray you therefore i will not keep silence whether i have done ill or whether i have done well and herein good fellows and my very brethren i would have you to follow me and if there be such here as i know full well there be some and may be a good many who have been robbers of their neighbours and who is my neighbour quoth the rich man or lechers or despiteful haters or talebearers or fawners on rich men for the hurt of the poor and that is the worst of all ah my poor brethren who have gone astray i say not to you go home and repent lest you mar our great deeds but rather come afield and there repent many a day have ye been fools but hearken unto me and i shall make you wise above the wisdom of the earth and if ye die in your wisdom as god wot ye well may since the fields ye wend to bear swords for daisies and spears for bents then shall ye be though men call you dead a part and parcel of the living wisdom of all things very stones of the pillars that uphold the joyful earth forsooth ye have heard it said that ye shall do well in this world that in the world to come ye may live happily for ever do ye well then and have your reward both on earth and in heaven for i say to you that earth and heaven are not two but one and this one is that which ye know and are each one of you a part of to wit the holy church and in each one of you dwelleth the life of the church unless ye slay it forsooth brethren will ye murder the church any one of you and go forth a wandering man and lonely even as cain did who slew his brother ah my brothers what an evil doom is this to be an outcast from the church to have none to love you and to speak with you to be without fellowship forsooth brothers fellowship is heaven and lack of fellowship is hell fellowship is life and lack of fellowship is death and the deeds that ye do upon the earth it is for fellowship's sake that ye do them and the life that is in it that shall live on and on for ever and each one of you part of it while many a man's life upon the earth from the earth shall wane therefore i bid you not dwell in hell but in heaven or while ye must upon earth which is a part of heaven and forsooth no foul part forsooth he that waketh in hell and feeleth his heart fail him shall have memory of the merry days of earth and how that when his heart failed him there he cried on his fellow were it his wife or his son or his brother or his gossip or his brother sworn in arms and how that his fellow heard him and came and they mourned together under the sun till again they laughed together and were but half sorry between them this shall he think on in hell and cry on his fellow to help him and shall find that therein is no help because there is no fellowship but every man for himself therefore i tell you that the proud despiteous rich man though he knoweth it not is in hell already because he hath no fellow and he that hath so hardy a heart that in sorrow he thinketh of fellowship his sorrow is soon but a story of sorrow a little change in the life that knows not ill he left off for a little and indeed for some time his voice had fallen but it was so clear and the summer evening so soft and still and the silence of the folk so complete that every word told his eyes fell down to the crowd as he stopped speaking since for some little while they had been looking far away into the blue distance of summer and the kind eyes of the man had a curious sight before him in that crowd for amongst them were many who by this time were not dry eyed and some wept outright in spite of their black beards while all had that look as if they were ashamed of themselves and did not want others to see how deeply they were moved after the fashion of their race when they are strongly stirred i looked at will green beside me his right hand clutched his bow so tight that the knuckles whitened he was staring straight before him and the tears were running out of his eyes and down his big nose as though without his will for his face was stolid and unmoved all the time till he caught my eye and then he screwed up the strangest face of scowling brow weeping eyes and smiling mouth while he dealt me a sounding thump in the ribs with his left elbow which though it would have knocked me down but for the crowd i took as an esquire does the accolade which makes a knight of him but while i pondered all these things and how men fight and lose the battle and the thing that they fought for comes about in spite of their defeat and when it comes turns out not to be what they meant and other men have to fight for what they meant under another name while i pondered all this john ball began to speak again in the same soft and dear voice with which he had left off good fellows it was your fellowship and your kindness that took me out of the archbishop's prison three days agone though god wot ye had nought to gain by it save outlawry and the gallows yet lacked i not your fellowship before ye drew near me in the body and when between me and canterbury street was yet a strong wall and the turnkeys and sergeants and bailiffs for hearken my friends and helpers many days ago when april was yet young i lay there and the heart that i had strung up to bear all things because of the fellowship of men and the blessed saints and the angels and those that are and those that are to be this heart that i had strung up like a strong bow fell into feebleness so that i lay there a longing for the green fields and the white thorn bushes and the lark singing over the corn and the talk of good fellows round the ale house bench and the babble of the little children and the team on the road and the beasts afield and all the life of earth and i alone all the while near my foes and afar from my friends mocked and flouted and starved with cold and hunger and so weak was my heart that though i longed for all these things yet i saw them not nor knew them but as names and i longed so sore to be gone that i chided myself that i had once done well and i said to myself forsooth hadst thou kept thy tongue between thy teeth thou mightest have been something if it had been but a parson of a town and comfortable to many a poor man and then mightest thou have clad here and there the naked back and filled the empty belly and holpen many and men would have spoken well of thee and of thyself thou hadst thought well and all this hast thou lost for lack of a word here and there to some great man and a little winking of the eyes amidst murder and wrong and unruth and now thou art nought and helpless and the hemp for thee is sown and grown and heckled and spun and lo there the rope for thy gallows tree all for nought for nought forsooth my friends thus i thought and sorrowed in my feebleness that i had not been a traitor to the fellowship of the church for e'en so evil was my foolish imagination yet forsooth as i fell a pondering over all the comfort and help that i might have been and that i might have had if i had been but a little of a trembling cur to creep and crawl before abbot and bishop and baron and bailiff came the thought over me of the evil of the world wherewith i john ball the rascal hedge priest had fought and striven in the fellowship of the saints in heaven and poor men upon earth yea forsooth once again i saw as of old the great treading down the little and the strong beating down the weak and cruel men fearing not and kind men daring not and wise men caring not and the saints in heaven forbearing and yet bidding me not to forbear forsooth i knew once more that he who doeth well in fellowship and because of fellowship shall not fail though he seem to fail to day but in days hereafter shall he and his work yet be alive and men be holpen by them to strive again and yet again and yet indeed even that was little since forsooth to strive was my pleasure and my life so i became a man once more and i rose up to my feet and went up and down my prison what i could for my hopples and into my mouth came words of good cheer even such as we to day have sung and stoutly i sang them even as we now have sung them and then did i rest me and once more thought of those pleasant fields where i would be and all the life of man and beast about them and i said to myself that i should see them once more before i died if but once it were forsooth this was strange that whereas before i longed for them and yet saw them not now that my longing was slaked my vision was cleared and i saw them as though the prison walls opened to me and i was out of canterbury street and amidst the green meadows of april and therewithal along with me folk that i have known and who are dead and folk that are living yea and all those of the fellowship on earth and in heaven yea and all that are here this day overlong were the tale to tell of them and of the time that is gone so thenceforward i wore through the days with no such faint heart until one day the prison opened verily and in the daylight and there were ye my fellows in the door your faces glad your hearts light with hope and your hands heavy with wrath then i saw and understood what was to do now therefore do ye understand it his voice was changed and grew louder than loud now as he cast his hands abroad towards that company with those last words of his and i could feel that all shame and fear was falling from those men and that mere fiery manhood was shining through their wonted english shamefast stubbornness and that they were moved indeed and saw the road before them yet no man spoke rather the silence of the men folk deepened as the sun's rays grew more level and more golden and the swifts wheeled about shriller and louder than before then again john ball spoke and said in good sooth i deem ye wot no worse than i do what is to do and first that somewhat we shall do since it is for him that is lonely or in prison to dream of fellowship but for him that is of a fellowship to do and not to dream and next ye know who is the foeman and that is the proud man the oppressor who scorneth fellowship and himself is a world to himself and needeth no helper nor helpeth any but heeding no law layeth law on other men because he is rich and surely every one that is rich is such an one nor may be other forsooth in the belly of every rich man dwelleth a devil of hell and when the man would give his goods to the poor the devil within him gainsayeth it and saith wilt thou then be of the poor and suffer cold and hunger and mocking as they suffer then give thou thy goods to them and keep them not and when he would be compassionate again saith the devil to him if thou heed these losels and turn on them a face like to their faces and deem of them as men then shall they scorn thee and evil shall come of it and even one day they shall fall on thee to slay thee when they have learned that thou art but as they be ah woe worth the while too oft he sayeth sooth as the wont of the devil is that lies may be born of the barren truth and sooth it is that the poor deemeth the rich to be other than he and meet to be his master as though forsooth the poor were come of adam and the rich of him that made adam that is god and thus the poor man oppresseth the poor man because he feareth the oppressor nought such are ye my brethren or else why are ye gathered here in harness to bid all bear witness of you that ye are the sons of one man and one mother begotten of the earth as he said the words there came a stir among the weapons of the throng and they pressed closer round the cross yet with held the shout as yet which seemed gathering in their bosoms and again he said forsooth too many rich men there are in this realm and yet if there were but one there would be one too many for all should be his thralls hearken then ye men of kent for overlong belike have i held you with words but the love of you constrained me and the joy that a man hath to babble to his friends and his fellows whom he hath not seen for a long season now hearken i bid you to the rich men that eat up a realm there cometh a time when they whom they eat up that is the poor seem poorer than of wont and their complaint goeth up louder to the heavens yet it is no riddle to say that oft at such times the fellowship of the poor is waxing stronger else would no man have heard his cry also at such times is the rich man become fearful and so waxeth in cruelty and of that cruelty do people misdeem that it is power and might waxing forsooth ye are stronger than your fathers because ye are more grieved than they and ye should have been less grieved than they had ye been horses and swine and then forsooth would ye have been stronger to bear but ye ye are not strong to bear but to do and wot ye why we are come to you this fair eve of holiday and wot ye why i have been telling of fellowship to you yea forsooth i deem ye wot well that it is for this cause that ye might bethink you of your fellowship with the men of essex his last word let loose the shout that had been long on all men's lips and great and fierce it was as it rang shattering through the quiet upland village but john ball held up his hand and the shout was one and no more then he spoke again men of kent i wot well that ye are not so hard bested as those of other shires by the token of the day when behind the screen of leafy boughs ye met duke william with bill and bow as he wended londonward from that woeful field of senlac but i have told of fellowship and ye have hearkened and understood what the holy church is whereby ye know that ye are fellows of the saints in heaven and the poor men of essex and as one day the saints shall call you to the heavenly feast so now do the poor men call you to the battle men of kent ye dwell fairly here and your houses are framed of stout oak beams and your own lands ye till unless some accursed lawyer with his false lying sheepskin and forged custom of the devil's manor hath stolen it from you but in essex slaves they be and villeins and worse they shall be and the lords swear that ere a year be over ox and horse shall go free in essex and man and woman shall draw the team and the plough and north away in the east countries dwell men in poor halls of wattled reeds and mud and the north east wind from off the fen whistles through them and poor they be to the letter and there him whom the lord spareth the bailiff squeezeth and him whom the bailiff forgetteth the easterling chapman sheareth yet be these stout men and valiant and your very brethren and yet if there be any man here so base as to think that a small matter let him look to it that if these necks abide under the yoke kent shall sweat for it ere it be long and ye shall lose acre and close and woodland and be servants in your own houses and your sons shall be the lords lads and your daughters their lemans and ye shall buy a bold word with many stripes and an honest deed with a leap from the gallows tree bethink ye too that ye have no longer to deal with duke william who if he were a thief and a cruel lord was yet a prudent man and a wise warrior but cruel are these and headstrong yea thieves and fools in one and ye shall lay their heads in the dust a shout would have arisen again but his eager voice rising higher yet restrained it as he said and how shall it be then when these are gone what else shall ye lack when ye lack masters ye shall not lack for the fields ye have tilled nor the houses ye have built nor the cloth ye have woven all these shall be yours and whatso ye will of all that the earth beareth then shall no man mow the deep grass for another while his own kine lack cow meat and he that soweth shall reap and the reaper shall eat in fellowship the harvest that in fellowship he hath won and he that buildeth a house shall dwell in it with those that he biddeth of his free will and the tithe barn shall garner the wheat for all men to eat of when the seasons are untoward and the rain drift hideth the sheaves in august and all shall be without money and without price faithfully and merrily then shall all men keep the holidays of the church in peace of body and joy of heart and man shall help man and the saints in heaven shall be glad because men no more fear each other and the churl shall be ashamed and shall hide his churlishness till it be gone and he be no more a churl and fellowship shall be established in heaven and on the earth chapter v they hear tidings of battle and make them ready he left off as one who had yet something else to say and indeed i thought he would give us some word as to the trysting place and whither the army was to go from it because it was now clear to me that this gathering was but a band of an army but much happened before john ball spoke again from the cross and it was on this wise when there was silence after the last shout that the crowd had raised a while ago i thought i heard a thin sharp noise far away somewhat to the north of the cross which i took rather for the sound of a trumpet or horn than for the voice of a man or any beast will green also seemed to have heard it for he turned his head sharply and then back again and looked keenly into the crowd as though seeking to catch some one's eye there was a very tall man standing by the prisoner on the horse near the outskirts of the crowd and holding his bridle this man who was well armed i saw look up and say something to the prisoner who stooped down and seemed to whisper him in turn the tall man nodded his head and the prisoner got off his horse which was a cleaner limbed better built beast than the others belonging to the band and the tall man quietly led him a little way from the crowd mounted him and rode off northward at a smart pace will green looked on sharply at all this and when the man rode off smiled as one who is content and deems that all is going well and settled himself down again to listen to the priest but now when john ball had ceased speaking and after another shout and a hum of excited pleasure and hope that followed it there was silence again and as the priest addressed himself to speaking once more he paused and turned his head towards the wind as if he heard something which certainly i heard and belike every one in the throng though it was not over loud far as sounds carry in clear quiet evenings it was the thump a thump of a horse drawing near at a hand gallop along the grassy upland road and i knew well it was the tall man coming back with tidings the purport of which i could well guess i looked up at will green's face he was smiling as one pleased and said softly as he nodded to me yea shall we see the grey goose fly this eve but john ball said in a great voice from the cross hear ye the tidings on the way fellows hold ye together and look to your gear yet hurry not for no great matter shall this be i wot well there is little force between canterbury and kingston for the lords are looking north of thames toward wat tyler and his men yet well it is well it is the crowd opened and spread out a little and the men moved about in it some tightening a girdle some getting their side arms more within reach of their right hands and those who had bows stringing them will green set hand and foot to the great shapely piece of polished red yew with its shining horn tips which he carried and bent it with no seeming effort then he reached out his hand over his shoulder and drew out a long arrow smooth white beautifully balanced with a barbed iron head at one end a horn nock and three strong goose feathers at the other he held it loosely between the finger and thumb of his right hand and there he stood with a thoughtful look on his face and in his hands one of the most terrible weapons which a strong man has ever carried the english long bow and cloth yard shaft but all this while the sound of the horse's hoofs was growing nearer and presently from the corner of the road amidst the orchards broke out our long friend his face red in the sun near sinking now he waved his right hand as he came in sight of us and sang out bills and bows bills and bows and the whole throng turned towards him and raised a great shout he reined up at the edge of the throng and spoke in a loud voice so that all might hear him fellows these are the tidings even while our priest was speaking we heard a horn blow far off so i bade the sergeant we have taken and who is now our fellow in arms to tell me where away it was that there would be folk a gathering and what they were and he did me to wit that mayhappen sir john newton was stirring from rochester castle or maybe it was the sheriff"
