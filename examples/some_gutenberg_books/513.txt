house she followed him droopingly and reluctant for all the glow and sparkle was gone out of her figure and whereas just before she had resembled a bright frosty star gemmed evening with a crimson gleam on the cold horizon she now looked as dull and languid as a thaw as kind mr lindsey led her up the steps of the door violet and peony looked into his face their eyes full of tears which froze before they could run down their cheeks and again entreated him not to bring their snow image into the house not bring her in exclaimed the kind hearted man why you are crazy my little violet quite crazy my small peony she is so cold already that her hand has almost frozen mine in spite of my thick gloves would you have her freeze to death his wife as he came up the steps had been taking another long earnest almost awe stricken gaze at the little white stranger she hardly knew whether it was a dream or no but she could not help fancying that she saw the delicate print of violet's fingers on the child's neck it looked just as if while violet was shaping out the image she had given it a gentle pat with her hand and had neglected to smooth the impression quite away after all husband said the mother recurring to her idea that the angels would be as much delighted to play with violet and peony as she herself was after all she does look strangely like a snow image i do believe she is made of snow a puff of the west wind blew against the snow child and again she sparkled like a star snow repeated good mr lindsey drawing the reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold no wonder she looks like snow she is half frozen poor little thing but a good fire will put everything to rights without further talk and always with the same best intentions this highly benevolent and common sensible individual led the little white damsel drooping drooping drooping more and more out of the frosty air and into his comfortable parlor a heidenberg stove filled to the brim with intensely burning anthracite was sending a bright gleam through the isinglass of its iron door and causing the vase of water on its top to fume and bubble with excitement a warm sultry smell was diffused throughout the room a thermometer on the wall farthest from the stove stood at eighty degrees the parlor was hung with red curtains and covered with a red carpet and looked just as warm as it felt the difference betwixt the atmosphere here and the cold wintry twilight out of doors was like stepping at once from nova zembla to the hottest part of india or from the north pole into an oven oh this was a fine place for the little white stranger the common sensible man placed the snow child on the hearth rug right in front of the hissing and fuming stove now she will be comfortable cried mr lindsey rubbing his hands and looking about him with the pleasantest smile you ever saw make yourself at home my child sad sad and drooping looked the little white maiden as she stood on the hearth rug with the hot blast of the stove striking through her like a pestilence once she threw a glance wistfully toward the windows and caught a glimpse through its red curtains of the snow covered roofs and the stars glimmering frostily and all the delicious intensity of the cold night the bleak wind rattled the window panes as if it were summoning her to come forth but there stood the snow child drooping before the hot stove but the common sensible man saw nothing amiss come wife said he let her have a pair of thick stockings and a woollen shawl or blanket directly and tell dora to give her some warm supper as soon as the milk boils you violet and peony amuse your little friend she is out of spirits you see at finding herself in a strange place for my part i will go around among the neighbors and find out where she belongs the mother meanwhile had gone in search of the shawl and stockings for her own view of the matter however subtle and delicate had given way as it always did to the stubborn materialism of her husband without heeding the remonstrances of his two children who still kept murmuring that their little snow sister did not love the warmth good mr lindsey took his departure shutting the parlor door carefully behind him turning up the collar of his sack over his ears he emerged from the house and had barely reached the street gate when he was recalled by the screams of violet and peony and the rapping of a thimbled finger against the parlor window husband husband cried his wife showing her horror stricken face through the window panes there is no need of going for the child's parents we told you so father screamed violet and peony as he re entered the parlor you would bring her in and now our poor dear beau ti ful little snow sister is thawed and their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears so that their father seeing what strange things occasionally happen in this every day world felt not a little anxious lest his children might be going to thaw too in the utmost perplexity he demanded an explanation of his wife she could only reply that being summoned to the parlor by the cries of violet and peony she found no trace of the little white maiden unless it were the remains of a heap of snow which while she was gazing at it melted quite away upon the hearth rug and there you see all that is left of it added she pointing to a pool of water in front of the stove yes father said violet looking reproachfully at him through her tears there is all that is left of our dear little snow sister naughty father cried peony stamping his foot and i shudder to say shaking his little fist at the common sensible man we told you how it would be what for did you bring her in and the heidenberg stove through the isinglass of its door seemed to glare at good mr lindsey like a red eyed demon triumphing in the mischief which it had done this you will observe was one of those rare cases which yet will occasionally happen where common sense finds itself at fault the remarkable story of the snow image though to that sagacious class of people to whom good mr lindsey belongs it may seem but a childish affair is nevertheless capable of being moralized in various methods greatly for their edification one of its lessons for instance might be that it behooves men and especially men of benevolence to consider well what they are about and before acting on their philanthropic purposes to be quite sure that they comprehend the nature and all the relations of the business in hand what has been established as an element of good to one being may prove absolute mischief to another even as the warmth of the parlor was proper enough for children of flesh and blood like violet and peony though by no means very wholesome even for them but involved nothing short of annihilation to the unfortunate snow image but after all there is no teaching anything to wise men of good mr lindsey's stamp they know everything oh to be sure everything that has been and everything that is and everything that by any future possibility can be and should some phenomenon of nature or providence transcend their system they will not recognize it even if it come to pass under their very noses wife said mr lindsey after a fit of silence see what a quantity of snow the children have brought in on their feet it has made quite a puddle here before the stove pray tell dora to bring some towels and mop it up the great stone face one afternoon when the sun was going down a mother and her little boy sat at the door of their cottage talking about the great stone face they had but to lift their eyes and there it was plainly to be seen though miles away with the sunshine brightening all its features and what was the great stone face embosomed amongst a family of lofty mountains there was a valley so spacious that it contained many thousand inhabitants some of these good people dwelt in log huts with the black forest all around them on the steep and difficult hill sides others had their homes in comfortable farm houses and cultivated the rich soil on the gentle slopes or level surfaces of the valley others again were congregated into populous villages where some wild highland rivulet tumbling down from its birthplace in the upper mountain region had been caught and tamed by human cunning and compelled to turn the machinery of cotton factories the inhabitants of this valley in short were numerous and of many modes of life but all of them grown people and children had a kind of familiarity with the great stone face although some possessed the gift of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of their neighbors the great stone face then was a work of nature in her mood of majestic playfulness formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks which had been thrown together in such a position as when viewed at a proper distance precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance it seemed as if an enormous giant or a titan had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice there was the broad arch of the forehead a hundred feet in height the nose with its long bridge and the vast lips which if they could have spoken would have rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other true it is that if the spectator approached too near he lost the outline of the gigantic visage and could discern only a heap of ponderous and gigantic rocks piled in chaotic ruin one upon another retracing his steps however the wondrous features would again be seen and the farther he withdrew from them the more like a human face with all its original divinity intact did they appear until as it grew dim in the distance with the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains clustering about it the great stone face seemed positively to be alive it was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or womanhood with the great stone face before their eyes for all the features were noble and the expression was at once grand and sweet as if it were the glow of a vast warm heart that embraced all mankind in its affections and had room for more it was an education only to look at it according to the belief of many people the valley owed much of its fertility to this benign aspect that was continually beaming over it illuminating the clouds and infusing its tenderness into the sunshine as we began with saying a mother and her little boy sat at their cottage door gazing at the great stone face and talking about it the child's name was ernest mother said he while the titanic visage smiled on him i wish that it could speak for it looks so very kindly that its voice must needs be pleasant if i were to see a man with such a face i should love him dearly if an old prophecy should come to pass answered his mother we may see a man some time or other with exactly such a face as that what prophecy do you mean dear mother eagerly inquired ernest pray tell me about it so his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her when she herself was younger than little ernest a story not of things that were past but of what was yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indians who formerly inhabited this valley had heard it from their forefathers to whom as they affirmed it had been murmured by the mountain streams and whispered by the wind among the tree tops the purport was that at some future day a child should be born hereabouts who was destined to become the greatest and noblest personage of his time and whose countenance in manhood should bear an exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few old fashioned people and young ones likewise in the ardor of their hopes still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy but others who had seen more of the world had watched and waited till they were weary and had beheld no man with such a face nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale at all events the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared o mother dear mother cried ernest clapping his hands above his head i do hope that i shall live to see him his mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman and felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy so she only said to him perhaps you may and ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him it was always in his mind whenever he looked upon the great stone face he spent his childhood in the log cottage where he was born and was dutiful to his mother and helpful to her in many things assisting her much with his little hands and more with his loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grew up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sun browned with labor in the fields but with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been taught at famous schools yet ernest had had no teacher save only that the great stone face became one to him when the toil of the day was over he would gaze at it for hours until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to his own look of veneration we must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake although the face may have looked no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret was that the boy's tender and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see and thus the love which was meant for all became his peculiar portion about this time there went a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretold from ages long ago who was to bear a resemblance to the great stone face had appeared at last it seems that many years before a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport where after getting together a little money he had set up as a shopkeeper his name but i could never learn whether it was his real one or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in life was gathergold being shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck he became an exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulky bottomed ships all the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one man's wealth the cold regions of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle sent him their tribute in the shape of furs hot africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the forests the east came bringing him the rich shawls and spices and teas and the effulgence of diamonds and the gleaming purity of large pearls the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yielded up her mighty whales that mr gathergold might sell their oil and make a profit of it be the original commodity what it might it was gold within his grasp it might be said of him as of midas in the fable that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened and grew yellow and was changed at once into sterling metal or which suited him still better into piles of coin and when mr gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth he bethought himself of his native valley and resolved to go back thither and end his days where he was born with this purpose in view he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in as i have said above it had already been rumored in the valley that mr gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked for and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the fact when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose as if by enchantment on the site of his father's old weatherbeaten farm house the exterior was of marble so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler ones which mr gathergold in his young play days before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation had been accustomed to build of snow it had a richly ornamented portico supported by tall pillars beneath which was a lofty door studded with silver knobs and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea the windows from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment were composed respectively of but one enormous pane of glass so transparently pure that it was said to be a finer medium than even the vacant atmosphere hardly anybody had been permitted to see the interior of this palace but it was reported and with good semblance of truth to be far more gorgeous than the outside insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other houses was silver or gold in this and mr gathergold's bedchamber especially made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have been able to close his eyes there but on the other hand mr gathergold was now so inured to wealth that perhaps he could not have closed his eyes unless where the gleam of it was certain to find its way beneath his eyelids in due time the mansion was finished next came the upholsterers with magnificent furniture then a whole troop of black and white servants the harbingers of mr gathergold who in his own majestic person was expected to arrive at sunset our friend ernest meanwhile had been deeply stirred by the idea that the great man the noble man the man of prophecy after so many ages of delay was at length to be made manifest to his native valley he knew boy as he was that there were a thousand ways in which mr gathergold with his vast wealth might transform himself into an angel of beneficence and assume a control over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the great stone face full of faith and hope ernest doubted not that what the people said was true and that now he was to behold the living likeness of those wondrous features on the mountain side while the boy was still gazing up the valley and fancying as he always did that the great stone face returned his gaze and looked kindly at him the rumbling of wheels was heard approaching swiftly along the winding road here he comes cried a group of people who were assembled to witness the arrival here comes the great mr gathergold a carriage drawn by four horses dashed round the turn of the road within it thrust partly out of the window appeared the physiognomy of the old man with a skin as yellow as if his own midas hand had transmuted it he had a low forehead small sharp eyes puckered about with innumerable wrinkles and very thin lips which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly together the very image of the great stone face shouted the people sure enough the old prophecy is true and here we have the great man come at last and what greatly perplexed ernest they seemed actually to believe that here was the likeness which they spoke of by the roadside there chanced to be an old beggar woman and two little beggar children stragglers from some far off region who as the carriage rolled onward held out their hands and lifted up their doleful voices most piteously beseeching charity a yellow claw the very same that had clawed together so much wealth poked itself out of the coach window and dropt some copper coins upon the ground so that though the great man's name seems to have been gathergold he might just as suitably have been nicknamed scattercopper still nevertheless with an earnest shout and evidently with as much good faith as ever the people bellowed he is the very image of the great stone face but ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that sordid visage and gazed up the valley where amid a gathering mist gilded by the last sunbeams he could still distinguish those glorious features which had impressed themselves into his soul their aspect cheered him what did the benign lips seem to say he will come fear not ernest the man will come the years went on and ernest ceased to be a boy he had grown to be a young man now he attracted little notice from the other inhabitants of the valley for they saw nothing remarkable in his way of life save that when the labor of the day was over he still loved to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the great stone face according to their idea of the matter it was a folly indeed but pardonable inasmuch as ernest was industrious kind and neighborly and neglected no duty for the sake of indulging this idle habit they knew not that the great stone face had become a teacher to him and that the sentiment which was expressed in it would enlarge the young man's heart and fill it with wider and deeper sympathies than other hearts they knew not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learned from books and a better life than could be moulded on the defaced example of other human lives neither did ernest know that the thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally in the fields and at the fireside and wherever he communed with himself were of a higher tone than those which all men shared with him a simple soul simple as when his mother first taught him the old prophecy he beheld the marvellous features beaming adown the valley and still wondered that their human counterpart was so long in making his appearance by this time poor mr gathergold was dead and buried and the oddest part of the matter was that his wealth which was the body and spirit of his existence had disappeared before his death leaving nothing of him but a living skeleton covered over with a wrinkled yellow skin since the melting away of his gold it had been very generally conceded that there was no such striking resemblance after all betwixt the ignoble features of the ruined merchant and that majestic face upon the mountain side so the people ceased to honor him during his lifetime and quietly consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease once in a while it is true his memory was brought up in connection with the magnificent palace which he had built and which had long ago been turned into a hotel for the accommodation of strangers multitudes of whom came every summer to visit that famous natural curiosity the great stone face thus mr gathergold being discredited and thrown into the shade the man of prophecy was yet to come it so happened that a native born son of the valley many years before had enlisted as a soldier and after a great deal of hard fighting had now become an illustrious commander whatever he may be called in history he was known in camps and on the battle field under the nickname of old blood and thunder this war worn veteran being now infirm with age and wounds and weary of the turmoil of a military life and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet that had so long been ringing in his ears had lately signified a purpose of returning to his native valley hoping to find repose where he remembered to have left it the inhabitants his old neighbors and their grown up children were resolved to welcome the renowned warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner and all the more enthusiastically it being affirmed that now at last the likeness of the great stone face had actually appeared an aid de camp of old blood and thunder travelling through the valley was said to have been struck with the resemblance moreover the schoolmates and early acquaintances of the general were ready to testify on oath that to the best of their recollection the aforesaid general had been exceedingly like the majestic image even when a boy only the idea had never occurred to them at that period great therefore was the excitement throughout the valley and many people who had never once thought of glancing at the great stone face for years before now spent their time in gazing at it for the sake of knowing exactly how general blood and thunder looked on the day of the great festival ernest with all the other people of the valley left their work and proceeded to the spot where the sylvan banquet was prepared as he approached the loud voice of the rev dr battleblast was heard beseeching a blessing on the good things set before them and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor they were assembled the tables were arranged in a cleared space of the woods shut in by the surrounding trees except where a vista opened eastward and afforded a distant view of the great stone face over the general's chair which was a relic from the home of washington there was an arch of verdant boughs with the laurel profusely intermixed and surmounted by his country's banner beneath which he had won his victories our friend ernest raised himself on his tiptoes in hopes to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest but there was a mighty crowd about the tables anxious to hear the toasts and speeches and to catch any word that might fall from the general in reply and a volunteer company doing duty as a guard pricked ruthlessly with their bayonets at any particularly quiet person among the throng so ernest being of an unobtrusive character was thrust quite into the background where he could see no more of old blood and thunder's physiognomy than if it had been still blazing on the battle field to console himself he turned towards the great stone face which like a faithful and long remembered friend looked back and smiled upon him through the vista of the forest meantime however he could overhear the remarks of various individuals who were comparing the features of the hero with the face on the distant mountain side tis the same face to a hair cried one man cutting a caper for joy wonderfully like that's a fact responded another like why i call it old blood and thunder himself in a monstrous looking glass cried a third and why not he's the greatest man of this or any other age beyond a doubt and then all three of the speakers gave a great shout which communicated electricity to the crowd and called forth a roar from a thousand voices that went reverberating for miles among the mountains until you might have supposed that the great stone face had poured its thunderbreath into the cry all these comments and this vast enthusiasm served the more to interest our friend nor did he think of questioning that now at length the mountain visage had found its human counterpart it is true ernest had imagined that this long looked for personage would appear in the character of a man of peace uttering wisdom and doing good and making people happy but taking an habitual breadth of view with all his simplicity he contended that providence should choose its own method of blessing mankind and could conceive that this great end might be effected even by a"
