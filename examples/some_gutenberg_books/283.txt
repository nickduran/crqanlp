"1" "you doing next she brooded a moment behind drooped lids then with a touch of hauteur i'm going to paris to study for the stage the stage darrow stared at her dismayed all his confused contradictory impressions assumed a new aspect at this announcement and to hide his surprise he added lightly ah then you will have paris after all hardly lady ulrica's paris it s not likely to be roses roses all the way it's not indeed real compassion prompted him to continue have you any any influence you can count on she gave a somewhat flippant little laugh none but my own i've never had any other to count on he passed over the obvious reply but have you any idea how the profession is over crowded i know i'm trite i've a very clear idea but i couldn't go on as i was of course not but since as you say you'd stuck it out longer than any of the others couldn't you at least have held on till you were sure of some kind of an opening she made no reply for a moment then she turned a listless glance to the rain beaten window oughtn't we be starting she asked with a lofty assumption of indifference that might have been lady ulrica's darrow surprised by the change but accepting her rebuff as a phase of what he guessed to be a confused and tormented mood rose from his seat and lifted her jacket from the chair back on which she had hung it to dry as he held it toward her she looked up at him quickly the truth is we quarrelled she broke out and i left last night without my dinner and without my salary ah he groaned with a sharp perception of all the sordid dangers that might attend such a break with mrs murrett and without a character she added as she slipped her arms into the jacket and without a trunk as it appears but didn't you say that before going there'd be time for another look at the station there was time for another look at the station but the look again resulted in disappointment since her trunk was nowhere to be found in the huge heap disgorged by the newly arrived london express the fact caused miss viner a moment's perturbation but she promptly adjusted herself to the necessity of proceeding on her journey and her decision confirmed darrow's vague resolve to go to paris instead of retracing his way to london miss viner seemed cheered at the prospect of his company and sustained by his offer to telegraph to charing cross for the missing trunk and he left her to wait in the fly while he hastened back to the telegraph office the enquiry despatched he was turning away from the desk when another thought struck him and he went back and indited a message to his servant in london if any letters with french post mark received since departure forward immediately to terminus hotel gare du nord paris then he rejoined miss viner and they drove off through the rain to the pier iii almost as soon as the train left calais her head had dropped back into the corner and she had fallen asleep sitting opposite in the compartment from which he had contrived to have other travellers excluded darrow looked at her curiously he had never seen a face that changed so quickly a moment since it had danced like a field of daisies in a summer breeze now under the pallid oscillating light of the lamp overhead it wore the hard stamp of experience as of a soft thing chilled into shape before its curves had rounded and it moved him to see that care already stole upon her when she slept the story she had imparted to him in the wheezing shaking cabin and at the calais buffet where he had insisted on offering her the dinner she had missed at mrs murrett's had given a distincter outline to her figure from the moment of entering the new york boarding school to which a preoccupied guardian had hastily consigned her after the death of her parents she had found herself alone in a busy and indifferent world her youthful history might in fact have been summed up in the statement that everybody had been too busy to look after her her guardian a drudge in a big banking house was absorbed by the office the guardian's wife by her health and her religion and an elder sister laura married unmarried remarried and pursuing through all these alternating phases some vaguely artistic ideal on which the guardian and his wife looked askance had as darrow conjectured taken their disapproval as a pretext for not troubling herself about poor sophy to whom perhaps for this reason she had remained the incarnation of remote romantic possibilities in the course of time a sudden stroke of the guardian's had thrown his personal affairs into a state of confusion from which after his widely lamented death it became evident that it would not be possible to extricate his ward's inheritance no one deplored this more sincerely than his widow who saw in it one more proof of her husband's life having been sacrificed to the innumerable duties imposed on him and who could hardly but for the counsels of religion have brought herself to pardon the young girl for her indirect share in hastening his end sophy did not resent this point of view she was really much sorrier for her guardian's death than for the loss of her insignificant fortune the latter had represented only the means of holding her in bondage and its disappearance was the occasion of her immediate plunge into the wide bright sea of life surrounding the island of her captivity she had first landed thanks to the intervention of the ladies who had directed her education in a fifth avenue school room where for a few months she acted as a buffer between three autocratic infants and their bodyguard of nurses and teachers the too pressing attentions of their father's valet had caused her to fly this sheltered spot against the express advice of her educational superiors who implied that in their own case refinement and self respect had always sufficed to keep the most ungovernable passions at bay the experience of the guardian's widow having been precisely similar and the deplorable precedent of laura's career being present to all their minds none of these ladies felt any obligation to intervene farther in sophy's affairs and she was accordingly left to her own resources a schoolmate from the rocky mountains who was taking her father and mother to europe had suggested sophy's accompanying them and going round with her while her progenitors in the care of the courier nursed their ailments at a fashionable bath darrow gathered that the going round with mamie hoke was a varied and diverting process but this relatively brilliant phase of sophy's career was cut short by the elopement of the inconsiderate mamie with a matinee idol who had followed her from new york and by the precipitate return of her parents to negotiate for the repurchase of their child it was then after an interval of repose with compassionate but impecunious american friends in paris that miss viner had been drawn into the turbid current of mrs murrett's career the impecunious compatriots had found mrs murrett for her and it was partly on their account because they were such dears and so unconscious poor confiding things of what they were letting her in for that sophy had stuck it out so long in the dreadful house in chelsea the farlows she explained to darrow were the best friends she had ever had and the only ones who had ever been decent about laura whom they had seen once and intensely admired but even after twenty years of paris they were the most incorrigibly inexperienced angels and quite persuaded that mrs murrett was a woman of great intellectual eminence and the house at chelsea the last of the salons darrow knew what she meant and she hadn't liked to undeceive them knowing that to do so would be virtually to throw herself back on their hands and feeling moreover after her previous experiences the urgent need of gaining at any cost a name for stability besides which she threw it off with a slight laugh no other chance in all these years had happened to come to her she had brushed in this outline of her career with light rapid strokes and in a tone of fatalism oddly untinged by bitterness darrow perceived that she classified people according to their greater or less luck in life but she appeared to harbour no resentment against the undefined power which dispensed the gift in such unequal measure things came one's way or they didn't and meanwhile one could only look on and make the most of small compensations such as watching the show at mrs murrett's and talking over the lady ulricas and other footlight figures and at any moment of course a turn of the kaleidoscope might suddenly toss a bright spangle into the grey pattern of one's days this light hearted philosophy was not without charm to a young man accustomed to more traditional views george darrow had had a fairly varied experience of feminine types but the women he had frequented had either been pronouncedly ladies or they had not grateful to both for ministering to the more complex masculine nature and disposed to assume that they had been evolved if not designed to that end he had instinctively kept the two groups apart in his mind avoiding that intermediate society which attempts to conciliate both theories of life bohemianism seemed to him a cheaper convention than the other two and he liked above all people who went as far as they could in their own line liked his ladies and their rivals to be equally unashamed of showing for exactly what they were he had not indeed the fact of lady ulrica was there to remind him been without his experience of a third type but that experience had left him with a contemptuous distaste for the woman who uses the privileges of one class to shelter the customs of another as to young girls he had never thought much about them since his early love for the girl who had become mrs leath that episode seemed as he looked back on it to bear no more relation to reality than a pale decorative design to the confused richness of a summer landscape he no longer understood the violent impulses and dreamy pauses of his own young heart or the inscrutable abandonments and reluctances of hers he had known a moment of anguish at losing her the mad plunge of youthful instincts against the barrier of fate but the first wave of stronger sensation had swept away all but the outline of their story and the memory of anna summers had made the image of the young girl sacred but the class uninteresting such generalisations belonged however to an earlier stage of his experience the more he saw of life the more incalculable he found it and he had learned to yield to his impressions without feeling the youthful need of relating them to others it was the girl in the opposite seat who had roused in him the dormant habit of comparison she was distinguished from the daughters of wealth by her avowed acquaintance with the real business of living a familiarity as different as possible from their theoretical proficiency yet it seemed to darrow that her experience had made her free without hardness and self assured without assertiveness the rush into amiens and the flash of the station lights into their compartment broke miss viner's sleep and without changing her position she lifted her lids and looked at darrow there was neither surprise nor bewilderment in the look she seemed instantly conscious not so much of where she was as of the fact that she was with him and that fact seemed enough to reassure her she did not even turn her head to look out her eyes continued to rest on him with a vague smile which appeared to light her face from within while her lips kept their sleepy droop shouts and the hurried tread of travellers came to them through the confusing cross lights of the platform a head appeared at the window and darrow threw himself forward to defend their solitude but the intruder was only a train hand going his round of inspection he passed on and the lights and cries of the station dropped away merged in a wider haze and a hollower resonance as the train gathered itself up with a long shake and rolled out again into the darkness miss viner's head sank back against the cushion pushing out a dusky wave of hair above her forehead the swaying of the train loosened a lock over her ear and she shook it back with a movement like a boy's while her gaze still rested on her companion you're not too tired she shook her head with a smile we shall be in before midnight we're very nearly on time he verified the statement by holding up his watch to the lamp she nodded dreamily it's all right i telegraphed mrs farlow that they mustn't think of coming to the station but they'll have told the concierge to look out for me you'll let me drive you there she nodded again and her eyes closed it was very pleasant to darrow that she made no effort to talk or to dissemble her sleepiness he sat watching her till the upper lashes met and mingled with the lower and their blent shadow lay on her cheek then he stood up and drew the curtain over the lamp drowning the compartment in a bluish twilight as he sank back into his seat he thought how differently anna summers or even anna leath would have behaved she would not have talked too much she would not have been either restless or embarrassed but her adaptability her appropriateness would not have been nature but tact the oddness of the situation would have made sleep impossible or if weariness had overcome her for a moment she would have waked with a start wondering where she was and how she had come there and if her hair were tidy and nothing short of hairpins and a glass would have restored her self possession the reflection set him wondering whether the sheltered girl's bringing up might not unfit her for all subsequent contact with life how much nearer to it had mrs leath been brought by marriage and motherhood and the passage of fourteen years what were all her reticences and evasions but the result of the deadening process of forming a lady the freshness he had marvelled at was like the unnatural whiteness of flowers forced in the dark as he looked back at their few days together he saw that their intercourse had been marked on her part by the same hesitations and reserves which had chilled their earlier intimacy once more they had had their hour together and she had wasted it as in her girlhood her eyes had made promises which her lips were afraid to keep she was still afraid of life of its ruthlessness its danger and mystery she was still the petted little girl who cannot be left alone in the dark his memory flew back to their youthful story and long forgotten details took shape before him how frail and faint the picture was they seemed he and she like the ghostly lovers of the grecian urn forever pursuing without ever clasping each other to this day he did not quite know what had parted them the break had been as fortuitous as the fluttering apart of two seed vessels on a wave of summer air the very slightness vagueness of the memory gave it an added poignancy he felt the mystic pang of the parent for a child which has just breathed and died why had it happened thus when the least shifting of influences might have made it all so different if she had been given to him then he would have put warmth in her veins and light in her eyes would have made her a woman through and through musing thus he had the sense of waste that is the bitterest harvest of experience a love like his might have given her the divine gift of self renewal and now he saw her fated to wane into old age repeating the same gestures echoing the words she had always heard and perhaps never guessing that just outside her glazed and curtained consciousness life rolled away a vast blackness starred with lights like the night landscape beyond the windows of the train the engine lowered its speed for the passage through a sleeping station in the light of the platform lamp darrow looked across at his companion her head had dropped toward one shoulder and her lips were just far enough apart for the reflection of the upper one to deepen the colour of the other the jolting of the train had again shaken loose the lock above her ear it danced on her cheek like the flit of a brown wing over flowers and darrow felt an intense desire to lean forward and put it back behind her ear iv as their motor cab on the way from the gare du nord turned into the central glitter of the boulevard darrow had bent over to point out an incandescent threshold there above the doorway an arch of flame flashed out the name of a great actress whose closing performances in a play of unusual originality had been the theme of long articles in the paris papers which darrow had tossed into their compartment at calais that's what you must see before you're twenty four hours older the girl followed his gesture eagerly she was all awake and alive now as if the heady rumours of the streets with their long effervescences of light had passed into her veins like wine cerdine is that where she acts she put her head out of the window straining back for a glimpse of the sacred threshold as they flew past it she sank into her seat with a satisfied sigh it's delicious enough just to know she's there i've never seen her you know when i was here with mamie hoke we never went anywhere but to the music halls because she couldn't understand any french and when i came back afterward to the farlows i was dead broke and couldn't afford the play and neither could they so the only chance we had was when friends of theirs invited us and once it was to see a tragedy by a roumanian lady and the other time it was for l'ami fritz at the francais darrow laughed you must do better than that now le vertige is a fine thing and cerdine gets some wonderful effects out of it you must come with me tomorrow evening to see it with your friends of course that is he added if there's any sort of chance of getting seats the flash of a street lamp lit up her radiant face oh will you really take us what fun to think that it's tomorrow already it was wonderfully pleasant to be able to give such pleasure darrow was not rich but it was almost impossible for him to picture the state of persons with tastes and perceptions like his own to whom an evening at the theatre was an unattainable indulgence there floated through his mind an answer of mrs leath's to his enquiry whether she had seen the play in question no i meant to of course but one is so overwhelmed with things in paris and then i'm rather sick of cerdine one is always being dragged to see her that among the people he frequented was the usual attitude toward such opportunities there were too many they were a nuisance one had to defend one's self he even remembered wondering at the moment whether to a really fine taste the exceptional thing could ever become indifferent through habit whether the appetite for beauty was so soon dulled that it could be kept alive only by privation here at any rate was a fine chance to experiment with such a hunger he almost wished he might stay on in paris long enough to take the measure of miss viner's receptivity she was still dwelling on his promise it's too beautiful of you oh don't you think you'll be able to get seats and then after a pause of brimming appreciation i wonder if you'll think me horrid but it may be my only chance and if you can't get places for us all wouldn't you perhaps just take me after all the farlows may have seen it he had not of course thought her horrid but only the more engaging for being so natural and so unashamed of showing the frank greed of her famished youth oh you shall go somehow he had gaily promised her and she had dropped back with a sigh of pleasure as their cab passed into the dimly lit streets of the farlows quarter beyond the seine this little passage came back to him the next morning as he opened his hotel window on the early roar of the northern terminus the girl was there in the room next to him that had been the first point in his waking consciousness the second was a sense of relief at the obligation imposed on him by this unexpected turn of everts to wake to the necessity of action to postpone perforce the fruitless contemplation of his private grievance was cause enough for gratitude even if the small adventure in which he found himself involved had not on its own merits roused an instinctive curiosity to see it through when he and his companion the night before had reached the farlows door in the rue de la chaise it was only to find after repeated assaults on its panels that the farlows were no longer there they had moved away the week before not only from their apartment but from paris and miss viner's breach with mrs murrett had been too sudden to permit her letter and telegram to overtake them both communications no doubt still reposed in a pigeon hole of the loge but its custodian when drawn from his lair sulkily declined to let miss viner verify the fact and only flung out in return for darrow's bribe the statement that the americans had gone to joigny to pursue them there at that hour was manifestly impossible and miss viner disturbed but not disconcerted by this new obstacle had quite simply acceded to darrow's suggestion that she should return for what remained of the night to the hotel where he had sent his luggage the drive back through the dark hush before dawn with the nocturnal blaze of the boulevard fading around them like the false lights of a magician's palace had so played on her impressionability that she seemed to give no farther thought to her own predicament darrow noticed that she did not feel the beauty and mystery of the spectacle as much as its pressure of human significance all its hidden implications of emotion and adventure as they passed the shadowy colonnade of the francais remote and temple like in the paling lights he felt a clutch on his arm and heard the cry there are things there that i want so desperately to see and all the way back to the hotel she continued to question him with shrewd precision and an artless thirst for detail about the theatrical life of paris he was struck afresh as he listened by the way in which her naturalness eased the situation of constraint leaving to it only a pleasant savour of good fellowship it was the kind of episode that one might in advance have characterized as awkward yet that was proving in the event as much outside such definitions as a sunrise stroll with a dryad in a dew drenched forest and darrow reflected that mankind would never have needed to invent tact if it had not first invented social complications it had been understood with his good night to miss viner that the next morning he was to look up the joigny trains and see her safely to the station but while he breakfasted and waited for a time table he recalled again her cry of joy at the prospect of seeing cerdine it was certainly a pity since that most elusive and incalculable of artists was leaving the next week for south america to miss what might be a last sight of her in her greatest part and darrow having dressed and made the requisite excerpts from the time table decided to carry the result of his deliberations to his neighbour's door it instantly opened at his knock and she came forth looking as if she had been plunged into some sparkling element which had curled up all her drooping tendrils and wrapped her in a shimmer of fresh leaves well what do you think of me she cried and with a hand at her waist she spun about as if to show off some miracle of parisian dress making i think the missing trunk has come and that it was worth waiting for you do like my dress i adore it i always adore new dresses why you don't mean to say it's not a new one she laughed out her triumph no no no my trunk hasn't come and this is only my old rag of yesterday but i never knew the trick to fail and as he stared you see she joyously explained i've always had to dress in all kinds of dreary left overs and sometimes when everybody else was smart and new it used to make me awfully miserable so one day when mrs murrett dragged me down unexpectedly to fill a place at dinner i suddenly thought i'd try spinning around like that and say to every one well what do you think of me and do you know they were all taken in including mrs murrett who didn't recognize my old turned and dyed rags and told me afterward it was awfully bad form to dress as if i were somebody that people would expect to know and ever since whenever i've particularly wanted to look nice i've just asked people what they thought of my new frock and they're always always taken in she dramatized her explanation so vividly that darrow felt as if his point were gained ah but this confirms your vocation of course he cried you must see cerdine and seeing her face fall at this reminder of the change in her prospects he hastened to set forth his plan as he did so he saw how easy it was to explain things to her she would either accept his suggestion or she would not but at least she would waste no time in protestations and objections or any vain sacrifice to the idols of conformity the conviction that one could on any given point almost predicate this of her gave him the sense of having advanced far enough in her intimacy to urge his arguments against a hasty pursuit of her friends yes it would certainly be foolish she at once agreed in the case of such dear indefinite angels as the farlows to dash off after them without more positive proof that they were established at joigny and so established that they could take her in she owned it was but too probable that they had gone there to cut down and might be doing so in quarters too contracted to receive her and it would be unfair on that chance to impose herself on them unannounced the simplest way of getting farther light on the question would be to go back to the rue de la chaise where at that more conversable hour the concierge might be less chary of detail and she could decide on her next step in the light of such facts as he imparted point by point she fell in with the suggestion recognizing in the light of their unexplained flight that the farlows might indeed be in a situation on which one could not too rashly intrude her concern for her friends seemed to have effaced all thought of herself and this little indication of character gave darrow a quite disproportionate pleasure she agreed that it would be well to go at once to the rue de la chaise but met his proposal that they should drive by the declaration that it was a waste not to walk in paris so they set off on foot through the cheerful tumult of the streets the walk was long enough for him to learn many things about her the storm of the previous night had cleared the air and paris shone in morning beauty under a sky that was all broad wet washes of white and blue but darrow again noticed that her visual sensitiveness was less keen than her feeling for what he was sure the good farlows whom he already seemed to know would have called the human interest she seemed hardly conscious of sensations of form and colour or of any imaginative suggestion and the spectacle before them always in its scenic splendour so moving to her companion broke up under her scrutiny into a"
