"1" "of recklessness and audacity he possessed neither courage perseverance nor self respect vanity tempered with self suspicion if not self knowledge a sense of people as automatons to his will a desire to pass as many boys as possible and get to a vague top of the world with this background did amory drift into adolescence preparatory to the great adventure the train slowed up with midsummer languor at lake geneva and amory caught sight of his mother waiting in her electric on the gravelled station drive it was an ancient electric one of the early types and painted gray the sight of her sitting there slenderly erect and of her face where beauty and dignity combined melting to a dreamy recollected smile filled him with a sudden great pride of her as they kissed coolly and he stepped into the electric he felt a quick fear lest he had lost the requisite charm to measure up to her dear boy you're _so_ tall look behind and see if there's anything coming she looked left and right she slipped cautiously into a speed of two miles an hour beseeching amory to act as sentinel and at one busy crossing she made him get out and run ahead to signal her forward like a traffic policeman beatrice was what might be termed a careful driver you _are_ tall but you're still very handsome you've skipped the awkward age or is that sixteen perhaps it's fourteen or fifteen i can never remember but you've skipped it don't embarrass me murmured amory but my dear boy what odd clothes they look as if they were a _set_ don't they is your underwear purple too amory grunted impolitely you must go to brooks and get some really nice suits oh we'll have a talk to night or perhaps to morrow night i want to tell you about your heart you've probably been neglecting your heart and you don't _know_ amory thought how superficial was the recent overlay of his own generation aside from a minute shyness he felt that the old cynical kinship with his mother had not been one bit broken yet for the first few days he wandered about the gardens and along the shore in a state of superloneliness finding a lethargic content in smoking bull at the garage with one of the chauffeurs the sixty acres of the estate were dotted with old and new summer houses and many fountains and white benches that came suddenly into sight from foliage hung hiding places there was a great and constantly increasing family of white cats that prowled the many flower beds and were silhouetted suddenly at night against the darkening trees it was on one of the shadowy paths that beatrice at last captured amory after mr blaine had as usual retired for the evening to his private library after reproving him for avoiding her she took him for a long tete a tete in the moonlight he could not reconcile himself to her beauty that was mother to his own the exquisite neck and shoulders the grace of a fortunate woman of thirty amory dear she crooned softly i had such a strange weird time after i left you did you beatrice when i had my last breakdown she spoke of it as a sturdy gallant feat the doctors told me her voice sang on a confidential note that if any man alive had done the consistent drinking that i have he would have been physically _shattered_ my dear and in his _grave_ long in his grave amory winced and wondered how this would have sounded to froggy parker yes continued beatrice tragically i had dreams wonderful visions she pressed the palms of her hands into her eyes i saw bronze rivers lapping marble shores and great birds that soared through the air parti colored birds with iridescent plumage i heard strange music and the flare of barbaric trumpets what amory had snickered what amory i said go on beatrice that was all it merely recurred and recurred gardens that flaunted coloring against which this would be quite dull moons that whirled and swayed paler than winter moons more golden than harvest moons are you quite well now beatrice quite well as well as i will ever be i am not understood amory i know that can't express it to you amory but i am not understood amory was quite moved he put his arm around his mother rubbing his head gently against her shoulder poor beatrice poor beatrice tell me about _you_ amory did you have two _horrible_ years amory considered lying and then decided against it no beatrice i enjoyed them i adapted myself to the bourgeoisie i became conventional he surprised himself by saying that and he pictured how froggy would have gaped beatrice he said suddenly i want to go away to school everybody in minneapolis is going to go away to school beatrice showed some alarm but you're only fifteen yes but everybody goes away to school at fifteen and i _want_ to beatrice on beatrice's suggestion the subject was dropped for the rest of the walk but a week later she delighted him by saying amory i have decided to let you have your way if you still want to you can go to school yes to st regis's in connecticut amory felt a quick excitement it's being arranged continued beatrice it's better that you should go away i'd have preferred you to have gone to eton and then to christ church oxford but it seems impracticable now and for the present we'll let the university question take care of itself what are you going to do beatrice heaven knows it seems my fate to fret away my years in this country not for a second do i regret being american indeed i think that a regret typical of very vulgar people and i feel sure we are the great coming nation yet and she sighed i feel my life should have drowsed away close to an older mellower civilization a land of greens and autumnal browns amory did not answer so his mother continued my regret is that you haven't been abroad but still as you are a man it's better that you should grow up here under the snarling eagle is that the right term amory agreed that it was she would not have appreciated the japanese invasion when do i go to school next month you'll have to start east a little early to take your examinations after that you'll have a free week so i want you to go up the hudson and pay a visit to who to monsignor darcy amory he wants to see you he went to harrow and then to yale became a catholic i want him to talk to you i feel he can be such a help she stroked his auburn hair gently dear amory dear amory dear beatrice so early in september amory provided with six suits summer underwear six suits winter underwear one sweater or t shirt one jersey one overcoat winter etc set out for new england the land of schools there were andover and exeter with their memories of new england dead large college like democracies st mark's groton st regis recruited from boston and the knickerbocker families of new york st paul's with its great rinks pomfret and st george's prosperous and well dressed taft and hotchkiss which prepared the wealth of the middle west for social success at yale pawling westminster choate kent and a hundred others all milling out their well set up conventional impressive type year after year their mental stimulus the college entrance exams their vague purpose set forth in a hundred circulars as to impart a thorough mental moral and physical training as a christian gentleman to fit the boy for meeting the problems of his day and generation and to give a solid foundation in the arts and sciences at st regis amory stayed three days and took his exams with a scoffing confidence then doubling back to new york to pay his tutelary visit the metropolis barely glimpsed made little impression on him except for the sense of cleanliness he drew from the tall white buildings seen from a hudson river steamboat in the early morning indeed his mind was so crowded with dreams of athletic prowess at school that he considered this visit only as a rather tiresome prelude to the great adventure this however it did not prove to be monsignor darcy's house was an ancient rambling structure set on a hill overlooking the river and there lived its owner between his trips to all parts of the roman catholic world rather like an exiled stuart king waiting to be called to the rule of his land monsignor was forty four then and bustling a trifle too stout for symmetry with hair the color of spun gold and a brilliant enveloping personality when he came into a room clad in his full purple regalia from thatch to toe he resembled a turner sunset and attracted both admiration and attention he had written two novels one of them violently anti catholic just before his conversion and five years later another in which he had attempted to turn all his clever jibes against catholics into even cleverer innuendoes against episcopalians he was intensely ritualistic startlingly dramatic loved the idea of god enough to be a celibate and rather liked his neighbor children adored him because he was like a child youth revelled in his company because he was still a youth and couldn't be shocked in the proper land and century he might have been a richelieu at present he was a very moral very religious if not particularly pious clergyman making a great mystery about pulling rusty wires and appreciating life to the fullest if not entirely enjoying it he and amory took to each other at first sight the jovial impressive prelate who could dazzle an embassy ball and the green eyed intent youth in his first long trousers accepted in their own minds a relation of father and son within a half hour's conversation my dear boy i've been waiting to see you for years take a big chair and we'll have a chat i've just come from school st regis's you know so your mother says a remarkable woman have a cigarette i'm sure you smoke well if you're like me you loathe all science and mathematics amory nodded vehemently hate em all like english and history of course you'll hate school for a while too but i'm glad you're going to st regis's why because it's a gentleman's school and democracy won't hit you so early you'll find plenty of that in college i want to go to princeton said amory i don't know why but i think of all harvard men as sissies like i used to be and all yale men as wearing big blue sweaters and smoking pipes monsignor chuckled i'm one you know oh you're different i think of princeton as being lazy and good looking and aristocratic you know like a spring day harvard seems sort of indoors and yale is november crisp and energetic finished monsignor that's it they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered i was for bonnie prince charlie announced amory of course you were and for hannibal yes and for the southern confederacy he was rather sceptical about being an irish patriot he suspected that being irish was being somewhat common but monsignor assured him that ireland was a romantic lost cause and irish people quite charming and that it should by all means be one of his principal biasses after a crowded hour which included several more cigarettes and during which monsignor learned to his surprise but not to his horror that amory had not been brought up a catholic he announced that he had another guest this turned out to be the honorable thornton hancock of boston ex minister to the hague author of an erudite history of the middle ages and the last of a distinguished patriotic and brilliant family he comes here for a rest said monsignor confidentially treating amory as a contemporary i act as an escape from the weariness of agnosticism and i think i'm the only man who knows how his staid old mind is really at sea and longs for a sturdy spar like the church to cling to their first luncheon was one of the memorable events of amory's early life he was quite radiant and gave off a peculiar brightness and charm monsignor called out the best that he had thought by question and suggestion and amory talked with an ingenious brilliance of a thousand impulses and desires and repulsions and faiths and fears he and monsignor held the floor and the older man with his less receptive less accepting yet certainly not colder mentality seemed content to listen and bask in the mellow sunshine that played between these two monsignor gave the effect of sunlight to many people amory gave it in his youth and to some extent when he was very much older but never again was it quite so mutually spontaneous he's a radiant boy thought thornton hancock who had seen the splendor of two continents and talked with parnell and gladstone and bismarck and afterward he added to monsignor but his education ought not to be intrusted to a school or college but for the next four years the best of amory's intellect was concentrated on matters of popularity the intricacies of a university social system and american society as represented by biltmore teas and hot springs golf links in all a wonderful week that saw amory's mind turned inside out a hundred of his theories confirmed and his joy of life crystallized to a thousand ambitions not that the conversation was scholastic heaven forbid amory had only the vaguest idea as to what bernard shaw was but monsignor made quite as much out of the beloved vagabond and sir nigel taking good care that amory never once felt out of his depth but the trumpets were sounding for amory's preliminary skirmish with his own generation you're not sorry to go of course with people like us our home is where we are not said monsignor i _am_ sorry no you're not no one person in the world is necessary to you or to me well good by the egotist down amory's two years at st regis though in turn painful and triumphant had as little real significance in his own life as the american prep school crushed as it is under the heel of the universities has to american life in general we have no eton to create the self consciousness of a governing class we have instead clean flaccid and innocuous preparatory schools he went all wrong at the start was generally considered both conceited and arrogant and universally detested he played football intensely alternating a reckless brilliancy with a tendency to keep himself as safe from hazard as decency would permit in a wild panic he backed out of a fight with a boy his own size to a chorus of scorn and a week later in desperation picked a battle with another boy very much bigger from which he emerged badly beaten but rather proud of himself he was resentful against all those in authority over him and this combined with a lazy indifference toward his work exasperated every master in school he grew discouraged and imagined himself a pariah took to sulking in corners and reading after lights with a dread of being alone he attached a few friends but since they were not among the elite of the school he used them simply as mirrors of himself audiences before which he might do that posing absolutely essential to him he was unbearably lonely desperately unhappy there were some few grains of comfort whenever amory was submerged his vanity was the last part to go below the surface so he could still enjoy a comfortable glow when wookey wookey the deaf old housekeeper told him that he was the best looking boy she had ever seen it had pleased him to be the lightest and youngest man on the first football squad it pleased him when doctor dougall told him at the end of a heated conference that he could if he wished get the best marks in school but doctor dougall was wrong it was temperamentally impossible for amory to get the best marks in school miserable confined to bounds unpopular with both faculty and students that was amory's first term but at christmas he had returned to minneapolis tight lipped and strangely jubilant oh i was sort of fresh at first he told frog parker patronizingly but i got along fine lightest man on the squad you ought to go away to school froggy it's great stuff incident of the well meaning professor on the last night of his first term mr margotson the senior master sent word to study hall that amory was to come to his room at nine amory suspected that advice was forthcoming but he determined to be courteous because this mr margotson had been kindly disposed toward him his summoner received him gravely and motioned him to a chair he hemmed several times and looked consciously kind as a man will when he knows he's on delicate ground amory he began i've sent for you on a personal matter yes sir i've noticed you this year and i i like you i think you have in you the makings of a a very good man yes sir amory managed to articulate he hated having people talk as if he were an admitted failure but i've noticed continued the older man blindly that you're not very popular with the boys no sir amory licked his lips ah i thought you might not understand exactly what it was they ah objected to i'm going to tell you because i believe ah that when a boy knows his difficulties he's better able to cope with them to conform to what others expect of him he a hemmed again with delicate reticence and continued they seem to think that you're ah rather too fresh amory could stand no more he rose from his chair scarcely controlling his voice when he spoke i know oh _don't_ you s'pose i know his voice rose i know what they think do you s'pose you have to _tell_ me he paused i'm i've got to go back now hope i'm not rude he left the room hurriedly in the cool air outside as he walked to his house he exulted in his refusal to be helped that _damn_ old fool he cried wildly as if i didn't _know he decided however that this was a good excuse not to go back to study hall that night so comfortably couched up in his room he munched nabiscos and finished the white company incident of the wonderful girl there was a bright star in february new york burst upon him on washington's birthday with the brilliance of a long anticipated event his glimpse of it as a vivid whiteness against a deep blue sky had left a picture of splendor that rivalled the dream cities in the arabian nights but this time he saw it by electric light and romance gleamed from the chariot race sign on broadway and from the women's eyes at the astor where he and young paskert from st regis had dinner when they walked down the aisle of the theatre greeted by the nervous twanging and discord of untuned violins and the sensuous heavy fragrance of paint and powder he moved in a sphere of epicurean delight everything enchanted him the play was the little millionaire with george m cohan and there was one stunning young brunette who made him sit with brimming eyes in the ecstasy of watching her dance oh you wonderful girl what a wonderful girl you are sang the tenor and amory agreed silently but passionately all your wonderful words thrill me through the violins swelled and quavered on the last notes the girl sank to a crumpled butterfly on the stage a great burst of clapping filled the house oh to fall in love like that to the languorous magic melody of such a tune the last scene was laid on a roof garden and the cellos sighed to the musical moon while light adventure and facile froth like comedy flitted back and forth in the calcium amory was on fire to be an habitui of roof gardens to meet a girl who should look like that better that very girl whose hair would be drenched with golden moonlight while at his elbow sparkling wine was poured by an unintelligible waiter when the curtain fell for the last time he gave such a long sigh that the people in front of him twisted around and stared and said loud enough for him to hear what a _remarkable_ looking boy this took his mind off the play and he wondered if he really did seem handsome to the population of new york paskert and he walked in silence toward their hotel the former was the first to speak his uncertain fifteen year old voice broke in in a melancholy strain on amory's musings i'd marry that girl to night there was no need to ask what girl he referred to i'd be proud to take her home and introduce her to my people continued paskert amory was distinctly impressed he wished he had said it instead of paskert it sounded so mature i wonder about actresses are they all pretty bad no _sir_ not by a darn sight said the worldly youth with emphasis and i know that girl's as good as gold i can tell they wandered on mixing in the broadway crowd dreaming on the music that eddied out of the cafes new faces flashed on and off like myriad lights pale or rouged faces tired yet sustained by a weary excitement amory watched them in fascination he was planning his life he was going to live in new york and be known at every restaurant and cafe wearing a dress suit from early evening to early morning sleeping away the dull hours of the forenoon yes _sir_ i'd marry that girl to night heroic in general tone october of his second and last year at st regis was a high point in amory's memory the game with groton was played from three of a snappy exhilarating afternoon far into the crisp autumnal twilight and amory at quarter back exhorting in wild despair making impossible tackles calling signals in a voice that had diminished to a hoarse furious whisper yet found time to revel in the blood stained bandage around his head and the straining glorious heroism of plunging crashing bodies and aching limbs for those minutes courage flowed like wine out of the november dusk and he was the eternal hero one with the sea rover on the prow of a norse galley one with roland and horatius sir nigel and ted coy scraped and stripped into trim and then flung by his own will into the breach beating back the tide hearing from afar the thunder of cheers finally bruised and weary but still elusive circling an end twisting changing pace straight arming falling behind the groton goal with two men on his legs in the only touchdown of the game the philosophy of the slicker from the scoffing superiority of sixth form year and success amory looked back with cynical wonder on his status of the year before he was changed as completely as amory blaine could ever be changed amory plus beatrice plus two years in minneapolis these had been his ingredients when he entered st regis but the minneapolis years were not a thick enough overlay to conceal the amory plus beatrice from the ferreting eyes of a boarding school so st regis had very painfully drilled beatrice out of him and begun to lay down new and more conventional planking on the fundamental amory but both st regis and amory were unconscious of the fact that this fundamental amory had not in himself changed those qualities for which he had suffered his moodiness his tendency to pose his laziness and his love of playing the fool were now taken as a matter of course recognized eccentricities in a star quarter back a clever actor and the editor of the st regis tattler it puzzled him to see impressionable small boys imitating the very vanities that had not long ago been contemptible weaknesses after the football season he slumped into dreamy content the night of the pre holiday dance he slipped away and went early to bed for the pleasure of hearing the violin music cross the grass and come surging in at his window many nights he lay there dreaming awake of secret cafes in mont martre where ivory women delved in romantic mysteries with diplomats and soldiers of fortune while orchestras played hungarian waltzes and the air was thick and exotic with intrigue and moonlight and adventure in the spring he read l'allegro by request and was inspired to lyrical outpourings on the subject of arcady and the pipes of pan he moved his bed so that the sun would wake him at dawn that he might dress and go out to the archaic swing that hung from an apple tree near the sixth form house seating himself in this he would pump higher and higher until he got the effect of swinging into the wide air into a fairyland of piping satyrs and nymphs with the faces of fair haired girls he passed in the streets of eastchester as the swing reached its highest point arcady really lay just over the brow of a certain hill where the brown road dwindled out of sight in a golden dot he read voluminously all spring the beginning of his eighteenth year the gentleman from indiana the new arabian nights the morals of marcus ordeyne the man who was thursday which he liked without understanding stover at yale that became somewhat of a text book dombey and son because he thought he really should read better stuff robert chambers david graham phillips and e phillips oppenheim complete and a scattering of tennyson and kipling of all his class work only l'allegro and some quality of rigid clarity in solid geometry stirred his languid interest as june drew near he felt the need of conversation to formulate his own ideas and to his surprise found a co philosopher in rahill the president of the sixth form in many a talk on the highroad or lying belly down along the edge of the baseball diamond or late at night with their cigarettes glowing in the dark they threshed out the questions of school and there was developed the term slicker got tobacco whispered rahill one night putting his head inside the door five minutes after lights sure i'm coming in take a couple of pillows and lie in the window seat why don't you amory sat up in bed and lit a cigarette while rahill settled for a conversation rahill's favorite subject was the respective futures of the sixth form and amory never tired of outlining them for his benefit ted converse at's easy he'll fail his exams tutor all summer at harstrum's get into sheff with about four conditions and flunk out in the middle of the freshman year then he'll go back west and raise hell for a year or so finally his father will make him go into the paint business he'll marry and have four sons all bone heads he'll always think st regis's spoiled him so he'll send his sons to day school in portland he'll die of locomotor ataxia when he's forty one and his wife will give a baptizing stand or whatever you call it to the presbyterian church with his name on it hold up amory that's too darned gloomy how about yourself i'm in a superior class you are too we're philosophers i'm not sure you are you've got a darn good head on you but amory knew that nothing in the abstract no theory or generality ever moved rahill until he stubbed his toe upon the concrete minutiae of it haven't insisted rahill i let people impose on me here and don't get anything out of it i'm the prey of my friends damn it do their lessons get em out of trouble pay em stupid summer visits and always entertain their kid sisters keep my temper when they get selfish and then they think they pay me back by voting for me and telling me i'm the big man of st regis's i want to get where everybody does their own work and i can tell people where to go i'm tired of being nice to every poor fish in school you're not a slicker said amory suddenly a what a slicker what the devil's that well it's something that that there's a lot of them you're not one and neither am i though i am more than you are who is one what makes you one amory considered why why i suppose that the _sign_ of it is when a fellow slicks his hair back with water like carstairs yes sure he's a slicker they spent two evenings getting an exact definition the slicker was good looking or clean looking he had brains social brains that is and he used all means on the broad path of honesty to get ahead be popular admired and never in trouble he dressed well was particularly"
