"1" "wonders where i hope soon to be later on i'll show you the documents that put me on the track of this idol enough now to show you an old map i found or rather a copy of it and some of the papers that tell of the idol and he spread out his packet of papers on the table in front of him his eyes shining with excitement and pleasure mr damon too leaned eagerly forward so tom swift went on the professor i come to you for help in this matter i want you to aid me in organizing an expedition to go to honduras after the idol of gold will you i'll help you of course said tom you may use any of my inventions you choose my airships my motor boats and submarines even my giant cannon if you think you can take it with you and as for the money part ned will arrange that for you but as for going with you myself it is out of the question i can't no honduras for me chapter iv fenimore beecher had tom swift's giant cannon been discharged somewhere in the vicinity of his home it could have caused but little more astonishment to mr damon and professor bumper than did the simple announcement of the young inventor the professor seemed to shrink back in his chair collapsing like an automobile tire when the air is let out as for mr damon he jumped up and cried bless my but that is as far as he got at least just then he did not seem to know what to bless but he looked as though he would have liked to include most of the universe surely you don't mean it tom swift gasped professor bumper at length won't you come with us no said tom slowly really i can't go i'm working on an invention of a new aeroplane stabilizer and if i go now it will be just at a time when i am within striking distance of success and the stabilizer is very much needed if it's a question of making a profit on it tom began mr damon i can let you have some money until oh no it isn't the money cried tom don't think that for a moment you see the european war has called for the use of a large number of aeroplanes and as the pilots of them frequently have to fight and so can not give their whole attention to the machines some form of automatic stabilizer is needed to prevent them turning turtle or going off at a wrong tangent so i have been working out a sort of modified gyroscope and it seems to answer the purpose i have already received advance orders for a number of my devices from abroad and as they are destined to save lives i feel that i ought to keep on with my work i'd like to go don't misunderstand me but i can't go at this time it is out of the question if you wait a year or maybe six months no it is impossible to wait tom declared professor bumper is it so important then to hurry asked mr damon you did not mention that to me professor bumper no i did not have time there are so many ends to my concerns but tom swift you simply must go i can't my dear professor much as i should like to but tom think of it cried mr damon who was as much excited as was the little bald headed scientist you never saw such an idol of gold as this what's its name and he looked questioningly at the professor quitzel the idol is called supplied professor bumper and it is supposed to be in a buried city named kurzon somewhere in the sierra de merendon range of mountains in the vicinity of the copan valley copan is a city or maybe we'll find it only a town when we get there and it is not far from the borders of guatemala tom if i could show you the translations i have made of the ancient documents referring to this idol and the wonderful city over which it kept guard i'm sure you'd come with us please don't tempt me tom said with a laugh i'm only too anxious to go and if it wasn't for the stabilizer i'd be with you in a minute but well you'll have to get along without me maybe i can join you later what's this about the idol keeping guard over the ancient city asked ned for he was interested in strange stories it seems explained the professor that in the early days there was a strange race of people inhabiting central america with a somewhat high civilization only traces of which remained when the spaniards came but these traces and such hieroglyphics or to be more exact pictographs as i have been able to decipher from the old documents tell of one country or perhaps it was only a city over which this great golden idol of quitzel presided there is in some of these papers a description of the idol which is not exactly a beauty judged from modern standards but the main fact is that it is made of solid gold and may weigh anywhere from one to two tons two tons of gold cried new newton why if that's the case it would be worth and he fell to doing a sum in mental arithmetic i am not so concerned about the monetary value of the statue as i am about its antiquity went on professor bumper there are other statues in this buried city of kurzon and though they may not be so valuable they will give me a wealth of material for my research work how do you know there are other statues asked mr damon because my documents tell me so it was because the people made other idols in opposition as it were to quitzel that their city or country was destroyed at least that is the legend quitzel so the story goes wanted to be the chief god and when the image of a rival was set up in the temple near him he toppled over in anger and part of the temple went with him the whole place being buried in ruins all the inhabitants were killed and trace of the ancient city was lost forever no i hope not forever for i expect to find it if all the people were killed and the city buried how did the story of quitzel become known asked mr damon one only of the priests in the temple of quitzel escaped and set down part of the tale said the professor it is his narrative or one based on it that i have given you and now what i want to do is to go and make a search for this buried city i have fairly good directions as to how it may be reached we will have little difficulty in getting to honduras as there are fruit steamers frequently sailing of course going into the interior to the copan valley is going to be harder but an expedition from a large college was recently there and succeeded after much labor in excavating part of a buried city whether or not it was kurzon i am unable to say but if there was one ancient city there must be more so i want to make an attempt and i counted on you tom you have had considerable experience in strange quarters of the earth and you're just the one to help me i don't need money for i have interested a certain millionaire and my own college will put up part of the funds oh it isn't a question of money said tom it's time that's just what it is with me exclaimed professor bumper i haven't any time to lose my rivals may even now be on their way to honduras your rivals cried tom you didn't say anything about them no i believe i didn't there were so many other things to talk about but there is a rival archaeologist who would ask nothing better than to get ahead of me in this matter he is younger than i am and youth is a big asset nowadays pooh you're not old cried mr damon you're no older than i am and i'm still young i'm a lot younger than some of these boys who are afraid to tackle a trip through a tropical wilderness and he playfully nudged tom in the ribs i'm not a bit afraid retorted the young inventor no i know you're not laughed mr damon but i've got to say something tom to stir you up ned how about you would you go i can't unless tom does you see i'm his financial man now there you are tom swift cried mr damon you see you are holding back a number of persons just because you don't want to go i certainly wouldn't like to go without tom said the professor slowly i really need his help you know tom we would never have found the city of pelone if it had not been for you and your marvelous powder the conditions in the copan valley are likely to be still more difficult to overcome and i feel that i risk failure without your young energy and your inventive mind to aid in the work and to suggest possible means of attaining our object come tom reconsider and decide to make the trip and my promise to go was dependent on tom's agreement to accompany us said mr damon come on urged the professor much as one boy might urge another to take part in a ball game don't let my rival get ahead of me i wouldn't like to see that tom said slowly who is he any one i know i don't believe so tom he's connected with a large new college that has plenty of money to spend on explorations and research work beecher is his name fenimore beecher beecher exclaimed tom and there was such a change in his manner that his friends could not help noticing it he jumped to his feet his eyes snapping and he looked eagerly and anxiously at professor bumper did you say his name was fenimore beecher tom asked in a tense voice that's what it is professor fenimore beecher he is really a learned young man and thoroughly in earnest though i do not like his manner but he is trying to get ahead of me which may account for my feeling tom swift did not answer instead he hurried from the room with a murmured apology i'll be back in about five minutes he said as he went out well what's up now asked mr damon of ned as the young inventor departed what set him off that way the mention of beecher's name evidently though i never heard him mention such a person before nor did i ever hear professor beecher speak of tom said the bald headed scientist well we'll just have to wait until at that moment tom came back into the room gentlemen he said i have reconsidered my refusal to go to the copan valley after the idol of gold i'm going with you good cried professor bumper fine ejaculated mr damon bless my time table i thought you'd come around tom swift but what about your stabilizer asked ned i was just talking to my father about it the young inventor replied he will be able to put the finishing touches on it so i'll leave it with him as soon as i can get ready i'll go since you say haste is necessary professor bumper it is if we are to get ahead of beecher then we'll get ahead of him cried tom i'm with you now from the start to the finish i'll show him what i can do he added while ned and the others wondered at the sudden change in their friend's manner chapter v the little green god tom how soon can we go asked professor bumper as he began arranging his papers maps and documents ready to place them back in the valise within a week if you want to start that soon the sooner the better a week will suit me i don't know just what beecher's plans are but he may try to get on the ground first though without boasting i may say that he has not had as much experience as i have had thanks to you tom when you helped me find the lost city of pelone well i hope we'll be as successful this time murmured tom i don't want to see beecher beat you i didn't know you knew him tom said the professor oh yes i have met him once and there was something in tom's manner though he tried to speak indifferently that made ned believe there was more behind his chum's sudden change of determination than had yet appeared he never mentioned you went on professor bumper yet the last time i saw him i said i was coming to see you though i did not tell him why no he wouldn't be likely to speak of me said tom significantly well if that's all settled i guess i'll go back home and pack up said mr damon making a move to depart there's no special rush tom said we won't leave for a week i can't get ready in much less time than that bless my socks i know that ejaculated mr damon but if i get my things packed i can go to a hotel to stay while my wife is away she might take a notion to come home unexpectedly and though she is a dear good soul she doesn't altogether approve of my going off on these wild trips with you tom swift but if i get all packed and clear out she can't find me and she can't hold me back she is visiting her mother now i can send her a wire from kurzon after i get there i don't believe the telegraph there is working laughed professor bumper but suit yourself i must go back to new york to arrange for the goods we'll have to take with us in a week tom we'll start you must stay to dinner tom said you can't get a train now anyhow and father wants to meet you again he's pretty well considering his age and he's much better i verily believe since i said i'd turn over to him the task of finishing the stabilizer he likes to work we'll stay and take the night train back agreed mr damon it will be like old times tom he went on traveling off together into the wilds central america is pretty wild isn't it he asked as if in fear of being disappointed on that score oh it's wild enough to suit any one answered professor bumper well now to settle a few details observed tom ned what is the situation as regards the financial affairs of my father and myself nothing will come to grief if we go away will there i guess not tom but are you going to take your father with you no of course not but you spoke of we i meant you and i are going me tom sure you i wouldn't think of leaving you behind you want ned along don't you professor of course it will be an ideal party we four we'll have to take natives when we get to honduras and make up a mule pack train for the interior i had some thoughts of asking you to take an airship along but it might frighten the indians and i shall have to depend on them for guides as well as for porters so it will be an old fashioned expedition in a way mr swift came in at this point to meet his old friends the boy needs a little excitement he said he's been puttering over that stabilizer invention too long i can finish the model for him in a very short time professor bumper told mr swift something about the proposed trip while mr damon went out with tom and ned to one of the shops to look at a new model aeroplane the young inventor had designed there was a merry party around the table at dinner though now and then ned noticed that tom had an abstracted and preoccupied air thinking about the idol of gold asked ned in a whisper to his chum when they were about to leave the table the idol of gold oh yes of course it will be great if we can bring that back with us but the manner in which he said this made ned feel sure that tom had had other thoughts and that he had used a little subterfuge in his answer ned was right as he proved for himself a little later when mr damon and the professor having gone home the young financial secretary took his friend to a quiet corner and asked what's the matter tom matter what do you mean i mean what made you make up your mind so quickly to go on this expedition when you heard beecher was going oh er well you wouldn't want to see our old friend professor bumper left would you after he had worked out the secret of the idol of gold you wouldn't want some young whipper snapper to beat him in the race would you ned no of course not neither would i that's why i changed my mind this beecher isn't going to get that idol if i can stop him you seem rather bitter against him bitter oh not at all i simply don't want to see my friends disappointed then beecher isn't a friend of yours oh i've met him that is all and tom tried to speak indifferently humph mused ned there's more here than i dreamed of i'm going to get at the bottom of it but though ned tried to pump tom he was not successful the young inventor admitted knowing the youthful scientist but that was all tom reiterating his determination not to let professor bumper be beaten in the race for the idol of gold let me see mused ned as he went home that evening tom did not change his mind until he heard beecher's name mentioned now this shows that beecher had something to do with it the only reason tom doesn't want beecher to get this idol or find the buried city is because professor bumper is after it and yet the professor is not an old or close friend of tom's they met only when tom went to dig his big tunnel there must be some other reason ned did some more thinking then he clapped his hands together and a smile spread over his face i believe i have it he cried the little green god as compared to the idol of gold that's it i'm going to make a call on my way home this he did stopping at the home of mary nestor a pretty girl who rumor had it was tacitly engaged to tom mary was not at home but mr nestor was and for ned's purpose this answered well well glad to see you exclaimed mary's father isn't tom with you he asked a moment later seeing that ned was alone no tom isn't with me this evening ned answered the fact is he's getting ready to go off on another expedition and i'm going with him you young men are always going somewhere remarked mrs nestor where is it to this time some place in central america ned answered not wishing to be too particular he was wondering how he could find out what he wanted to know when mary's mother unexpectedly gave him just the information he was after central america she exclaimed why father and she looked at her husband that's where professor beecher is going isn't it yes i believe he did mention something about that professor beecher the man who is an authority on aztec ruins asked ned taking a shot in the dark yes said mr nestor and a mighty fine young man he is too i knew his father well he was here on a visit not long ago young beecher was and he talked most entertainingly about his discoveries you remember how interested mary was mother yes she seemed to be said mrs nestor tom swift dropped in during the course of the evening she added to ned and mary introduced him to professor beecher but i can't say that tom was much interested in the professor's talk no questioned ned no not at all but tom did not stay long he left just as mary and the professor were drawing a map so the professor could indicate where he had once made a big discovery i see murmured ned well i suppose tom must have been thinking of something else at the time very likely agreed mr nestor but tom missed a very profitable talk i was very much interested myself in what the professor told us and so was mary she invited mr beecher to come again he takes after his father in being very thorough in what he does sometimes i think went on mr nestor that tom isn't quite steady enough he's thinking of so many things perhaps that he can't get his mind down to the commonplace i remember he once sent something here in a box labeled dynamite though there was no explosive in it it gave us a great fright but tom is a boy in spite of his years professor beecher seems much older we all like him very much that's nice said ned as he took his departure he had found out what he had come to learn i knew it ned exclaimed as he walked home i knew something was in the wind the little green god of jealousy has tom in his clutches that's why my inventive friend was so anxious to go on this expedition when he learned beecher was to go he wants to beat him i guess the professor has plainly shown that he wouldn't like anything better than to cut tom out with mary whew that's something to think about chapter vi unpleasant news ned newton decided to keep to himself what he had heard at the nestor home not for the world would he let tom swift know of the situation that is i won't let him know that i know said ned to himself though he is probably as well aware of the situation as i am but it sure is queer that this professor beecher should have taken such a fancy to mary and that her father should regard him so well that is natural i suppose but i wonder how mary herself feels about it that is the part tom would be most interested in no wonder tom wants to get ahead of this young college chap who probably thinks he's the whole show if he can find the buried city and get the idol of gold it would be a big feather in his cap he'd have no end of honors heaped on him and i suppose his hat wouldn't come within three sizes of fitting him then he'd stand in better than ever with mr nestor and maybe with mary too though i think she is loyal to tom but one never can tell however i'm glad i know about it i'll do all i can to help tom without letting him know that i know and if i can do anything to help in finding that idol of gold for professor bumper and incidentally tom i'll do it and he spoke aloud in his enthusiasm ned who was walking along in the darkness clapped his open hand down on tom's magazine he was carrying home to read again and the resultant noise was a sharp crack as it sounded a figure jumped from behind a tree and called tensely hold on there ned stopped short thinking he was to be the victim of a holdup but his fears were allayed when he beheld one of the police force of shopton confronting him i heard what you said about gettin the gold went on the officer i was walkin along and i heard you talkin where's your pal i haven't any mr newbold answered ned with a laugh as he recognized the man oh pshaw it's ned newton exclaimed the disappointed officer i thought you was talkin to a confederate about gold and figured maybe you was goin to rob the bank no nothing like that answered ned still much amused i was talking to myself about a trip tom swift and i are going to take and oh that's all right responded the policeman i can understand it if it had anything to do with tom he's a great boy indeed he is agreed ned making a mental resolve not to be so public with his thoughts in the future he chatted for a moment with the officer and then bidding him good night walked on to his home his mind in a whirl with conglomerate visions of buried cities great grinning idols of gold and rival professors seeking to be first at the goal the next few days were busy ones for tom ned and in fact the whole swift household tom and his father had several consultations and conducted several experiments in regard to the new stabilizer the completion of which was so earnestly desired mr swift was sure he could carry the invention to a successful conclusion ned was engaged in putting the financial affairs of the swift company in shape so they would practically run themselves during his absence then too there was the packing of their baggage which must be seen to of course the main details of the trip were left to professor bumper who knew just what to do he had told tom and ned that all they and mr damon would have to do would be to meet him at the pier in new york where they would find all arrangements made one day near the end of the week the beginning of the next being set for the start eradicate came shuffling into the room where tom was sorting out the possessions he desired to take with him ned assisting him in the task well rad what is it asked tom with businesslike energy i done heah massa tom dat yo all's gwine off on a long trip once mo am dat so yes that's so rad well den i'se come to ast yo whut i'd bettah take wif me shall i took warm clothes or cool clothes well if you were going rad answered tom with a smile you'd need cool clothes for we're going to a sort of jungle land but i'm sorry to say you're not going this trip i i ain't gwine does yo mean dat yo all ain't gwine to take me massa tom that's it rad it isn't any trip for you is certain not broke in the voice of koku the giant who entered with a big trunk tom had sent him for master want strong man like a bull he take koku look heah spluttered eradicate and his eyes flashed yo yo giant yo yo may be strong laik a bull but ya ain't got as much sense as mah mule boomerang massa tom don't want no sich pusson wif him he's gwine to take me he take me cried koku and his voice was a roar while he beat on his mighty chest with his huge fists tom seeing that the dispute was likely to be bothersome winked at ned and began to speak i don't believe you'd like it there rad not where we're going it's a bad country why the mosquitoes there bite holes in you raise bumps on you as big as eggs oh good land ejaculated the old colored man am dat so massa tom it sure is then there's another kind of bug that burrows under your fingernails and if you don't get em out your fingers drop off oh good land massa tom am dat a fact it sure is i don't want to see those things happen to you rad slowly the old colored man shook his head i don't mahse'f he said i i guess i won't go eradicate did not stop to ask how tom and ned proposed to combat these two species of insects but there remained koku to dispose of and he stood smiling broadly as eradicate shuffled off me no fraid bugs said the giant no said tom with a look at ned for he did not want to take the big man on the trip for various reasons no maybe not koku your skin is pretty tough but i understand there are deep pools of water in the land where we are going and in them lives a fish that has a hide like an alligator and a jaw like a shark if you fall in it's all up with you dat true master tom and koku's voice trembled well i've never seen such a fish i'm sure but the natives tell about it koku seemed to be considering the matter strange as it may seem the giant though afraid of nothing human and brave when it came to a hand to"
