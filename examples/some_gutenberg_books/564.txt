so powerfully described is attended with some real suffering and is hard to bear but let me reassure you jack as to the chances of its overcoming me i don't think i am in the way of it in some few months less than another year you know i shall carry pussy off from school as mrs edwin drood i shall then go engineering into the east and pussy with me and although we have our little tiffs now arising out of a certain unavoidable flatness that attends our love making owing to its end being all settled beforehand still i have no doubt of our getting on capitally then when it's done and can't be helped in short jack to go back to the old song i was freely quoting at dinner and who knows old songs better than you my wife shall dance and i will sing so merrily pass the day of pussy's being beautiful there cannot be a doubt and when you are good besides little miss impudence once more apostrophising the portrait i'll burn your comic likeness and paint your music master another mr jasper with his hand to his chin and with an expression of musing benevolence on his face has attentively watched every animated look and gesture attending the delivery of these words he remains in that attitude after they are spoken as if in a kind of fascination attendant on his strong interest in the youthful spirit that he loves so well then he says with a quiet smile you won't be warned then no jack you can't be warned then no jack not by you besides that i don't really consider myself in danger i don't like your putting yourself in that position shall we go and walk in the churchyard by all means you won't mind my slipping out of it for half a moment to the nuns house and leaving a parcel there only gloves for pussy as many pairs of gloves as she is years old to day rather poetical jack mr jasper still in the same attitude murmurs nothing half so sweet in life ned here's the parcel in my greatcoat pocket they must be presented to night or the poetry is gone it's against regulations for me to call at night but not to leave a packet i am ready jack mr jasper dissolves his attitude and they go out together chapter iii the nuns house for sufficient reasons which this narrative will itself unfold as it advances a fictitious name must be bestowed upon the old cathedral town let it stand in these pages as cloisterham it was once possibly known to the druids by another name and certainly to the romans by another and to the saxons by another and to the normans by another and a name more or less in the course of many centuries can be of little moment to its dusty chronicles an ancient city cloisterham and no meet dwelling place for any one with hankerings after the noisy world a monotonous silent city deriving an earthy flavour throughout from its cathedral crypt and so abounding in vestiges of monastic graves that the cloisterham children grow small salad in the dust of abbots and abbesses and make dirt pies of nuns and friars while every ploughman in its outlying fields renders to once puissant lord treasurers archbishops bishops and such like the attention which the ogre in the story book desired to render to his unbidden visitor and grinds their bones to make his bread a drowsy city cloisterham whose inhabitants seem to suppose with an inconsistency more strange than rare that all its changes lie behind it and that there are no more to come a queer moral to derive from antiquity yet older than any traceable antiquity so silent are the streets of cloisterham though prone to echo on the smallest provocation that of a summer day the sunblinds of its shops scarce dare to flap in the south wind while the sun browned tramps who pass along and stare quicken their limp a little that they may the sooner get beyond the confines of its oppressive respectability this is a feat not difficult of achievement seeing that the streets of cloisterham city are little more than one narrow street by which you get into it and get out of it the rest being mostly disappointing yards with pumps in them and no thoroughfare exception made of the cathedral close and a paved quaker settlement in colour and general confirmation very like a quakeress's bonnet up in a shady corner in a word a city of another and a bygone time is cloisterham with its hoarse cathedral bell its hoarse rooks hovering about the cathedral tower its hoarser and less distinct rooks in the stalls far beneath fragments of old wall saint's chapel chapter house convent and monastery have got incongruously or obstructively built into many of its houses and gardens much as kindred jumbled notions have become incorporated into many of its citizens minds all things in it are of the past even its single pawnbroker takes in no pledges nor has he for a long time but offers vainly an unredeemed stock for sale of which the costlier articles are dim and pale old watches apparently in a slow perspiration tarnished sugar tongs with ineffectual legs and odd volumes of dismal books the most abundant and the most agreeable evidences of progressing life in cloisterham are the evidences of vegetable life in many gardens even its drooping and despondent little theatre has its poor strip of garden receiving the foul fiend when he ducks from its stage into the infernal regions among scarlet beans or oyster shells according to the season of the year in the midst of cloisterham stands the nuns house a venerable brick edifice whose present appellation is doubtless derived from the legend of its conventual uses on the trim gate enclosing its old courtyard is a resplendent brass plate flashing forth the legend seminary for young ladies miss twinkleton the house front is so old and worn and the brass plate is so shining and staring that the general result has reminded imaginative strangers of a battered old beau with a large modern eye glass stuck in his blind eye whether the nuns of yore being of a submissive rather than a stiff necked generation habitually bent their contemplative heads to avoid collision with the beams in the low ceilings of the many chambers of their house whether they sat in its long low windows telling their beads for their mortification instead of making necklaces of them for their adornment whether they were ever walled up alive in odd angles and jutting gables of the building for having some ineradicable leaven of busy mother nature in them which has kept the fermenting world alive ever since these may be matters of interest to its haunting ghosts if any but constitute no item in miss twinkleton's half yearly accounts they are neither of miss twinkleton's inclusive regulars nor of her extras the lady who undertakes the poetical department of the establishment at so much or so little a quarter has no pieces in her list of recitals bearing on such unprofitable questions as in some cases of drunkenness and in others of animal magnetism there are two states of consciousness which never clash but each of which pursues its separate course as though it were continuous instead of broken thus if i hide my watch when i am drunk i must be drunk again before i can remember where so miss twinkleton has two distinct and separate phases of being every night the moment the young ladies have retired to rest does miss twinkleton smarten up her curls a little brighten up her eyes a little and become a sprightlier miss twinkleton than the young ladies have ever seen every night at the same hour does miss twinkleton resume the topics of the previous night comprehending the tenderer scandal of cloisterham of which she has no knowledge whatever by day and references to a certain season at tunbridge wells airily called by miss twinkleton in this state of her existence the wells notably the season wherein a certain finished gentleman compassionately called by miss twinkleton in this stage of her existence foolish mr porters revealed a homage of the heart whereof miss twinkleton in her scholastic state of existence is as ignorant as a granite pillar miss twinkleton's companion in both states of existence and equally adaptable to either is one mrs tisher a deferential widow with a weak back a chronic sigh and a suppressed voice who looks after the young ladies wardrobes and leads them to infer that she has seen better days perhaps this is the reason why it is an article of faith with the servants handed down from race to race that the departed tisher was a hairdresser the pet pupil of the nuns house is miss rosa bud of course called rosebud wonderfully pretty wonderfully childish wonderfully whimsical an awkward interest awkward because romantic attaches to miss bud in the minds of the young ladies on account of its being known to them that a husband has been chosen for her by will and bequest and that her guardian is bound down to bestow her on that husband when he comes of age miss twinkleton in her seminarial state of existence has combated the romantic aspect of this destiny by affecting to shake her head over it behind miss bud's dimpled shoulders and to brood on the unhappy lot of that doomed little victim but with no better effect possibly some unfelt touch of foolish mr porters has undermined the endeavour than to evoke from the young ladies an unanimous bedchamber cry of o what a pretending old thing miss twinkleton is my dear the nuns house is never in such a state of flutter as when this allotted husband calls to see little rosebud it is unanimously understood by the young ladies that he is lawfully entitled to this privilege and that if miss twinkleton disputed it she would be instantly taken up and transported when his ring at the gate bell is expected or takes place every young lady who can under any pretence look out of window looks out of window while every young lady who is practising practises out of time and the french class becomes so demoralised that the mark goes round as briskly as the bottle at a convivial party in the last century on the afternoon of the day next after the dinner of two at the gatehouse the bell is rung with the usual fluttering results mr edwin drood to see miss rosa this is the announcement of the parlour maid in chief miss twinkleton with an exemplary air of melancholy on her turns to the sacrifice and says you may go down my dear miss bud goes down followed by all eyes mr edwin drood is waiting in miss twinkleton's own parlour a dainty room with nothing more directly scholastic in it than a terrestrial and a celestial globe these expressive machines imply to parents and guardians that even when miss twinkleton retires into the bosom of privacy duty may at any moment compel her to become a sort of wandering jewess scouring the earth and soaring through the skies in search of knowledge for her pupils the last new maid who has never seen the young gentleman miss rosa is engaged to and who is making his acquaintance between the hinges of the open door left open for the purpose stumbles guiltily down the kitchen stairs as a charming little apparition with its face concealed by a little silk apron thrown over its head glides into the parlour o _it is_ so ridiculous says the apparition stopping and shrinking don't eddy don't what rosa don't come any nearer please it _is_ so absurd what is absurd rosa the whole thing is it _is_ so absurd to be an engaged orphan and it _is_ so absurd to have the girls and the servants scuttling about after one like mice in the wainscot and it _is_ so absurd to be called upon the apparition appears to have a thumb in the corner of its mouth while making this complaint you give me an affectionate reception pussy i must say well i will in a minute eddy but i can't just yet how are you very shortly i am unable to reply that i am much the better for seeing you pussy inasmuch as i see nothing of you this second remonstrance brings a dark bright pouting eye out from a corner of the apron but it swiftly becomes invisible again as the apparition exclaims o good gracious you have had half your hair cut off i should have done better to have had my head cut off i think says edwin rumpling the hair in question with a fierce glance at the looking glass and giving an impatient stamp shall i go no you needn't go just yet eddy the girls would all be asking questions why you went once for all rosa will you uncover that ridiculous little head of yours and give me a welcome the apron is pulled off the childish head as its wearer replies you're very welcome eddy there i'm sure that's nice shake hands no i can't kiss you because i've got an acidulated drop in my mouth are you at all glad to see me pussy o yes i'm dreadfully glad go and sit down miss twinkleton it is the custom of that excellent lady when these visits occur to appear every three minutes either in her own person or in that of mrs tisher and lay an offering on the shrine of propriety by affecting to look for some desiderated article on the present occasion miss twinkleton gracefully gliding in and out says in passing how do you do mr drood very glad indeed to have the pleasure pray excuse me tweezers thank you i got the gloves last evening eddy and i like them very much they are beauties well that's something the affianced replies half grumbling the smallest encouragement thankfully received and how did you pass your birthday pussy delightfully everybody gave me a present and we had a feast and we had a ball at night a feast and a ball eh these occasions seem to go off tolerably well without me pussy de lightfully cries rosa in a quite spontaneous manner and without the least pretence of reserve hah and what was the feast tarts oranges jellies and shrimps any partners at the ball we danced with one another of course sir but some of the girls made game to be their brothers it _was_ so droll did anybody make game to be to be you o dear yes cries rosa laughing with great enjoyment that was the first thing done i hope she did it pretty well says edwin rather doubtfully o it was excellent i wouldn't dance with you you know edwin scarcely seems to see the force of this begs to know if he may take the liberty to ask why because i was so tired of you returns rosa but she quickly adds and pleadingly too seeing displeasure in his face dear eddy you were just as tired of me you know did i say so rosa say so do you ever say so no you only showed it o she did it so well cries rosa in a sudden ecstasy with her counterfeit betrothed it strikes me that she must be a devilish impudent girl says edwin drood and so pussy you have passed your last birthday in this old house ah yes rosa clasps her hands looks down with a sigh and shakes her head you seem to be sorry rosa i am sorry for the poor old place somehow i feel as if it would miss me when i am gone so far away so young perhaps we had better stop short rosa she looks up at him with a swift bright look next moment shakes her head sighs and looks down again that is to say is it pussy that we are both resigned she nods her head again and after a short silence quaintly bursts out with you know we must be married and married from here eddy or the poor girls will be so dreadfully disappointed for the moment there is more of compassion both for her and for himself in her affianced husband's face than there is of love he checks the look and asks shall i take you out for a walk rosa dear rosa dear does not seem at all clear on this point until her face which has been comically reflective brightens o yes eddy let us go for a walk and i tell you what we'll do you shall pretend that you are engaged to somebody else and i'll pretend that i am not engaged to anybody and then we shan't quarrel do you think that will prevent our falling out rosa i know it will hush pretend to look out of window mrs tisher through a fortuitous concourse of accidents the matronly tisher heaves in sight says in rustling through the room like the legendary ghost of a dowager in silken skirts i hope i see mr drood well though i needn't ask if i may judge from his complexion i trust i disturb no one but there _was_ a paper knife o thank you i am sure and disappears with her prize one other thing you must do eddy to oblige me says rosebud the moment we get into the street you must put me outside and keep close to the house yourself squeeze and graze yourself against it by all means rosa if you wish it might i ask why o because i don't want the girls to see you it's a fine day but would you like me to carry an umbrella up don't be foolish sir you haven't got polished leather boots on pouting with one shoulder raised perhaps that might escape the notice of the girls even if they did see me remarks edwin looking down at his boots with a sudden distaste for them nothing escapes their notice sir and then i know what would happen some of them would begin reflecting on me by saying for _they_ are free that they never will on any account engage themselves to lovers without polished leather boots hark miss twinkleton i'll ask for leave that discreet lady being indeed heard without inquiring of nobody in a blandly conversational tone as she advances eh indeed are you quite sure you saw my mother of pearl button holder on the work table in my room is at once solicited for walking leave and graciously accords it and soon the young couple go out of the nuns house taking all precautions against the discovery of the so vitally defective boots of mr edwin drood precautions let us hope effective for the peace of mrs edwin drood that is to be which way shall we take rosa rosa replies i want to go to the lumps of delight shop to the a turkish sweetmeat sir my gracious me don't you understand anything call yourself an engineer and not know _that_ why how should i know it rosa because i am very fond of them but o i forgot what we are to pretend no you needn't know anything about them never mind so he is gloomily borne off to the lumps of delight shop where rosa makes her purchase and after offering some to him which he rather indignantly declines begins to partake of it with great zest previously taking off and rolling up a pair of little pink gloves like rose leaves and occasionally putting her little pink fingers to her rosy lips to cleanse them from the dust of delight that comes off the lumps now be a good tempered eddy and pretend and so you are engaged and so i am engaged is she nice charming tall immensely tall rosa being short must be gawky i should think is rosa's quiet commentary i beg your pardon not at all contradiction rising in him what is termed a fine woman a splendid woman big nose no doubt is the quiet commentary again not a little one certainly is the quick reply rosa's being a little one long pale nose with a red knob in the middle i know the sort of nose says rosa with a satisfied nod and tranquilly enjoying the lumps you _don't_ know the sort of nose rosa with some warmth because it's nothing of the kind not a pale nose eddy no determined not to assent a red nose o i don't like red noses however to be sure she can always powder it she would scorn to powder it says edwin becoming heated would she what a stupid thing she must be is she stupid in everything no in nothing after a pause in which the whimsically wicked face has not been unobservant of him rosa says and this most sensible of creatures likes the idea of being carried off to egypt does she eddy yes she takes a sensible interest in triumphs of engineering skill especially when they are to change the whole condition of an undeveloped country lor says rosa shrugging her shoulders with a little laugh of wonder do you object edwin inquires with a majestic turn of his eyes downward upon the fairy figure do you object rosa to her feeling that interest object my dear eddy but really doesn't she hate boilers and things i can answer for her not being so idiotic as to hate boilers he returns with angry emphasis though i cannot answer for her views about things really not understanding what things are meant but don't she hate arabs and turks and fellahs and people certainly not very firmly at least she _must_ hate the pyramids come eddy why should she be such a little tall i mean goose as to hate the pyramids rosa ah you should hear miss twinkleton often nodding her head and much enjoying the lumps bore about them and then you wouldn't ask tiresome old burying grounds isises and ibises and cheopses and pharaohses who cares about them and then there was belzoni or somebody dragged out by the legs half choked with bats and dust all the girls say serve him right and hope it hurt him and wish he had been quite choked the two youthful figures side by side but not now arm in arm wander discontentedly about the old close and each sometimes stops and slowly imprints a deeper footstep in the fallen leaves well says edwin after a lengthy silence according to custom we can't get on rosa rosa tosses her head and says she don't want to get on that's a pretty sentiment rosa considering considering what if i say what you'll go wrong again _you'll_ go wrong you mean eddy don't be ungenerous ungenerous i like that then i _don't_ like that and so i tell you plainly rosa pouts now rosa i put it to you who disparaged my profession my destination you are not going to be buried in the pyramids i hope she interrupts arching her delicate eyebrows you never said you were if you are why haven't you mentioned it to me i can't find out your plans by instinct now rosa you know very well what i mean my dear well then why did you begin with your detestable red nosed giantesses and she would she would she would she would she would powder it cries rosa in a little burst of comical contradictory spleen somehow or other i never can come right in these discussions says edwin sighing and becoming resigned how is it possible sir that you ever can come right when you're always wrong and as to belzoni i suppose he's dead i'm sure i hope he is and how can his legs or his chokes concern you it is nearly time for your return rosa we have not had a very happy walk have we a happy walk a detestably unhappy walk sir if i go up stairs the moment i get in and cry till i can't take my dancing lesson you are responsible mind let us be friends rosa ah cries rosa shaking her head and bursting into real tears i wish we _could_ be friends it's because we can't be friends that we try one another so i am a young little thing eddy to have an old heartache but i really really have sometimes don't be angry i know you have one yourself too often we should both of us have done better if what is to be had been left what might have been i am quite a little serious thing now and not teasing you let each of us forbear this one time on our own account and on the other's disarmed by this glimpse of a woman's nature in the spoilt child though for an instant disposed to resent it as seeming to involve the enforced infliction of himself upon her edwin drood stands watching her as she childishly cries and sobs with both hands to the handkerchief at her eyes and then she becoming more composed and indeed beginning in her young inconstancy to laugh at herself for having been so moved leads her to a seat hard by under the elm trees picture under the trees one clear word of understanding pussy dear i am not clever out of my own line now i come to think of it i don't know that i am particularly clever in it but i want to do right there is not there may be i really don't see my way to what i want to say but i must say it before we part there is not any other young o no eddy it's generous of you to ask me but no no no they have come very near to the cathedral windows and at this moment the organ and the choir sound out sublimely as they sit listening to the solemn swell the confidence of last night rises in young edwin drood's mind and he thinks how unlike this music is to that discordance i fancy i can distinguish jack's voice is his remark in a low tone in connection with the train of thought take me back at once please urges his affianced quickly laying her light hand upon his wrist they will all be coming out directly let us get away o what a resounding chord but don't let us stop to listen to it let us get away her hurry is over as soon as they have passed out of the close they go arm in arm now gravely and deliberately enough along the old high street to the nuns house at the gate the street being within sight empty edwin bends down his face to rosebud's she remonstrates laughing and is a childish schoolgirl again eddy no i'm too sticky to be kissed but give me your hand and i'll blow a kiss into that he does so she breathes a light breath into it and asks retaining it and looking into it now say what do you see see rosa why i thought you egyptian boys could look into a hand and see all sorts of phantoms can't you see a happy future for certain neither of them sees a happy present as the gate opens and closes and one goes in and the other goes away chapter iv mr sapsea accepting the jackass as the type of self sufficient stupidity and conceit a custom perhaps like some few other customs more conventional than fair then the purest jackass in cloisterham is mr thomas sapsea auctioneer mr sapsea dresses at the dean has been bowed to for the dean in mistake has even been spoken to in the street as my lord under the impression that he was the bishop come down unexpectedly without his chaplain mr sapsea is very proud of this and of his voice and of his style he has even in selling landed property tried the experiment of slightly intoning in his pulpit to make himself more like what he takes to be the genuine ecclesiastical article so in ending a sale by public auction mr sapsea finishes off with an air of bestowing a benediction on the assembled brokers which leaves the real dean a modest and worthy gentleman far behind mr sapsea has many admirers indeed the proposition is carried by a large local majority even including non believers in his wisdom that he is a credit to cloisterham he possesses the great qualities of being portentous and dull and of having a roll in his speech and another roll in his gait not to mention a certain gravely flowing action with his hands as if he were presently going to confirm the individual with whom he holds discourse much nearer sixty years of age than fifty with a flowing outline of stomach and horizontal creases in his waistcoat reputed to be rich voting at elections in the strictly respectable interest morally satisfied that nothing but he himself has grown since he was a baby how can dunder headed mr sapsea be otherwise than a credit to cloisterham and"
