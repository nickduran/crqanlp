"1" "then your case would have been different from that of the other spectators i should have explained the whole thing to you and i am sure we would have had a great deal of pleasure and profit too in discussing your experiences the subject is extremely explain to me she cried you would not have dared to do it i do not know how brave you may be but i know you would not have had the courage to come here and tell me that you had taken away my reason and my judgment as you took them away from all those people and that you had made me a mere tool of your will glaring and panting with excitement at the wonderful things you told me to see where nothing existed i have nothing to say about the others they can speak for themselves if they ever come to know what you did to them i speak for myself i stood up with the rest of the people i gazed with all my power and over and over again i asked myself if it could be possible that anything was the matter with my eyes or my brain and if i could be the only person there who could not see the marvellous spectacle that you were describing but now i know that nothing was real not even the little pine table not even the man not even me exclaimed loring surely i was real enough on that stage yes she said but you there proved you were not the herbert loring to whom i promised myself he was an unreal being if he had existed he would not have been a man who would have brought me to that public place all ignorant of his intentions to cloud my perceptions to subject my intellect to his own and make me believe a lie if a man should treat me in that way once he would treat me so at other times and in other ways if he had the chance you have treated me in the past as to day you treated those people who glared at the magic egg in the days gone by you made me see an unreal man but you will never do it again good by edith cried loring you don't but she had disappeared through a side door and he never spoke to her again walking home through the dimly lighted streets loring involuntarily spoke aloud and this he said is what came out of the magic egg his wife's deceased sister it is now five years since an event occurred which so colored my life or rather so changed some of its original colors that i have thought it well to write an account of it deeming that its lessons may be of advantage to persons whose situations in life are similar to my own when i was quite a young man i adopted literature as a profession and having passed through the necessary preparatory grades i found myself after a good many years of hard and often unremunerative work in possession of what might be called a fair literary practice my articles grave gay practical or fanciful had come to be considered with a favor by the editors of the various periodicals for which i wrote on which i found in time i could rely with a very comfortable certainty my productions created no enthusiasm in the reading public they gave me no great reputation or very valuable pecuniary return but they were always accepted and my receipts from them at the time to which i have referred were as regular and reliable as a salary and quite sufficient to give me more than a comfortable support it was at this time i married i had been engaged for more than a year but had not been willing to assume the support of a wife until i felt that my pecuniary position was so assured that i could do so with full satisfaction to my own conscience there was now no doubt in regard to this position either in my mind or in that of my wife i worked with great steadiness and regularity i knew exactly where to place the productions of my pen and could calculate with a fair degree of accuracy the sums i should receive for them we were by no means rich but we had enough and were thoroughly satisfied and content those of my readers who are married will have no difficulty in remembering the peculiar ecstasy of the first weeks of their wedded life it is then that the flowers of this world bloom brightest that its sun is the most genial that its clouds are the scarcest that its fruit is the most delicious that the air is the most balmy that its cigars are of the highest flavor that the warmth and radiance of early matrimonial felicity so rarefy the intellectual atmosphere that the soul mounts higher and enjoys a wider prospect than ever before these experiences were mine the plain claret of my mind was changed to sparkling champagne and at the very height of its effervescence i wrote a story the happy thought that then struck me for a tale was of a very peculiar character and it interested me so much that i went to work at it with great delight and enthusiasm and finished it in a comparatively short time the title of the story was his wife's deceased sister and when i read it to hypatia she was delighted with it and at times was so affected by its pathos that her uncontrollable emotion caused a sympathetic dimness in my eyes which prevented my seeing the words i had written when the reading was ended and my wife had dried her eyes she turned to me and said this story will make your fortune there has been nothing so pathetic since lamartine's history of a servant girl as soon as possible the next day i sent my story to the editor of the periodical for which i wrote most frequently and in which my best productions generally appeared in a few days i had a letter from the editor in which he praised my story as he had never before praised anything from my pen it had interested and charmed he said not only himself but all his associates in the office even old gibson who never cared to read anything until it was in proof and who never praised anything which had not a joke in it was induced by the example of the others to read this manuscript and shed as he asserted the first tears that had come from his eyes since his final paternal castigation some forty years before the story would appear the editor assured me as soon as he could possibly find room for it if anything could make our skies more genial our flowers brighter and the flavor of our fruit and cigars more delicious it was a letter like this and when in a very short time the story was published we found that the reading public was inclined to receive it with as much sympathetic interest and favor as had been shown to it by the editors my personal friends soon began to express enthusiastic opinions upon it it was highly praised in many of the leading newspapers and altogether it was a great literary success i am not inclined to be vain of my writings and in general my wife tells me i think too little of them but i did feel a good deal of pride and satisfaction in the success of his wife's deceased sister if it did not make my fortune as my wife asserted it would it certainly would help me very much in my literary career in less than a month from the writing of this story something very unusual and unexpected happened to me a manuscript was returned by the editor of the periodical in which his wife's deceased sister had appeared it is a good story he wrote but not equal to what you have just done you have made a great hit and it would not do to interfere with the reputation you have gained by publishing anything inferior to his wife's deceased sister which has had such a deserved success i was so unaccustomed to having my work thrown back on my hands that i think i must have turned a little pale when i read the letter i said nothing of the matter to my wife for it would be foolish to drop such grains of sand as this into the smoothly oiled machinery of our domestic felicity but i immediately sent the story to another editor i am not able to express the astonishment i felt when in the course of a week it was sent back to me the tone of the note accompanying it indicated a somewhat injured feeling on the part of the editor i am reluctant he said to decline a manuscript from you but you know very well that if you sent me anything like his wife's deceased sister it would be most promptly accepted i now felt obliged to speak of the affair to my wife who was quite as much surprised though perhaps not quite as much shocked as i had been let us read the story again she said and see what is the matter with it when we had finished its perusal hypatia remarked it is quite as good as many of the stories you have had printed and i think it very interesting although of course it is not equal to his wife's deceased sister of course not said i that was an inspiration that i cannot expect every day but there must be something wrong about this last story which we do not perceive perhaps my recent success may have made me a little careless in writing it i don't believe that said hypatia at any rate i continued i will lay it aside and will go to work on a new one in due course of time i had another manuscript finished and i sent it to my favorite periodical it was retained some weeks and then came back to me it will never do the editor wrote quite warmly for you to go backward the demand for the number containing his wife's deceased sister still continues and we do not intend to let you disappoint that great body of readers who would be so eager to see another number containing one of your stories i sent this manuscript to four other periodicals and from each of them it was returned with remarks to the effect that although it was not a bad story in itself it was not what they would expect from the author of his wife's deceased sister the editor of a western magazine wrote to me for a story to be published in a special number which he would issue for the holidays i wrote him one of the character and length he desired and sent it to him by return mail it came back to me i had hoped the editor wrote when i asked for a story from your pen to receive something like his wife's deceased sister and i must own that i am very much disappointed i was so filled with anger when i read this note that i openly objurgated his wife's deceased sister you must excuse me i said to my astonished wife for expressing myself thus in your presence but that confounded story will be the ruin of me yet until it is forgotten nobody will ever take anything i write and you cannot expect it ever to be forgotten said hypatia with tears in her eyes it is needless for me to detail my literary efforts in the course of the next few months the ideas of the editors with whom my principal business had been done in regard to my literary ability had been so raised by my unfortunate story of his wife's deceased sister that i found it was of no use to send them anything of lesser merit and as to the other journals which i tried they evidently considered it an insult for me to send them matter inferior to that by which my reputation had lately risen the fact was that my successful story had ruined me my income was at an end and want actually stared me in the face and i must admit that i did not like the expression of its countenance it was of no use for me to try to write another story like his wife's deceased sister i could not get married every time i began a new manuscript and it was the exaltation of mind caused by my wedded felicity which produced that story it's perfectly dreadful said my wife if i had had a sister and she had died i would have thought it was my fault it could not be your fault i answered and i do not think it was mine i had no intention of deceiving anybody into the belief that i could do that sort of thing every time and it ought not to be expected of me suppose raphael's patrons had tried to keep him screwed up to the pitch of the sistine madonna and had refused to buy anything which was not as good as that in that case i think he would have occupied a much earlier and narrower grave than the one on which mr morris moore hangs his funeral decorations but my dear said hypatia who was posted on such subjects the sistine madonna was one of his latest paintings very true said i but if he had married as i did he would have painted it earlier i was walking homeward one afternoon about this time when i met barbel a man i had known well in my early literary career he was now about fifty years of age but looked older his hair and beard were quite gray and his clothes which were of the same general hue gave me the idea that they like his hair had originally been black age is very hard on a man's external appointments barbel had an air of having been to let for a long time and quite out of repair but there was a kindly gleam in his eye and he welcomed me cordially why what is the matter old fellow said he i never saw you look so woe begone i had no reason to conceal anything from barbel in my younger days he had been of great use to me and he had a right to know the state of my affairs i laid the whole case plainly before him look here he said when i had finished come with me to my room i have something i would like to say to you there i followed barbel to his room it was at the top of a very dirty and well worn house which stood in a narrow and lumpy street into which few vehicles ever penetrated except the ash and garbage carts and the rickety wagons of the venders of stale vegetables this is not exactly a fashionable promenade said barbel as we approached the house but in some respects it reminds me of the streets in italian towns where the palaces lean over toward each other in such a friendly way barbel's room was to my mind rather more doleful than the street it was dark it was dusty and cobwebs hung from every corner the few chairs upon the floor and the books upon a greasy table seemed to be afflicted with some dorsal epidemic for their backs were either gone or broken a little bedstead in the corner was covered with a spread made of new york heralds with their edges pasted together there is nothing better said barbel noticing my glance toward this novel counterpane for a bed covering than newspapers they keep you as warm as a blanket and are much lighter i used to use tribunes but they rattled too much the only part of the room which was well lighted was one end near the solitary window here upon a table with a spliced leg stood a little grindstone at the other end of the room said barbel is my cook stove which you can't see unless i light the candle in the bottle which stands by it but if you don't care particularly to examine it i won't go to the expense of lighting up you might pick up a good many odd pieces of bric a brac around here if you chose to strike a match and investigate but i would not advise you to do so it would pay better to throw the things out of the window than to carry them down stairs the particular piece of indoor decoration to which i wish to call your attention is this and he led me to a little wooden frame which hung against the wall near the window behind a dusty piece of glass it held what appeared to be a leaf from a small magazine or journal there said he you see a page from the grasshopper a humorous paper which flourished in this city some half dozen years ago i used to write regularly for that paper as you may remember oh yes indeed i exclaimed and i shall never forget your conundrum of the anvil which appeared in it how often have i laughed at that most wonderful conceit and how often have i put it to my friends barbel gazed at me silently for a moment and then he pointed to the frame that printed page he said solemnly contains the conundrum of the anvil i hang it there so that i can see it while i work that conundrum ruined me it was the last thing i wrote for the grasshopper how i ever came to imagine it i cannot tell it is one of those things which occur to a man but once in a lifetime after the wild shout of delight with which the public greeted that conundrum my subsequent efforts met with hoots of derision the grasshopper turned its hind legs upon me i sank from bad to worse much worse until at last i found myself reduced to my present occupation which is that of grinding points on pins by this i procure my bread coffee and tobacco and sometimes potatoes and meat one day while i was hard at work an organ grinder came into the street below he played the serenade from trovatore and the familiar notes brought back visions of old days and old delights when the successful writer wore good clothes and sat at operas when he looked into sweet eyes and talked of italian airs when his future appeared all a succession of bright scenery and joyous acts without any provision for a drop curtain and as my ear listened and my mind wandered in this happy retrospect my every faculty seemed exalted and without any thought upon the matter i ground points upon my pins so fine so regular and so smooth that they would have pierced with ease the leather of a boot or slipped without abrasion among the finest threads of rare old lace when the organ stopped and i fell back into my real world of cobwebs and mustiness i gazed upon the pins i had just ground and without a moment's hesitation i threw them into the street and reported the lot as spoiled this cost me a little money but it saved me my livelihood after a few moments of silence barbel resumed i have no more to say to you my young friend all i want you to do is to look upon that framed conundrum then upon this grindstone and then to go home and reflect as for me i have a gross of pins to grind before the sun goes down i cannot say that my depression of mind was at all relieved by what i had seen and heard i had lost sight of barbel for some years and i had supposed him still floating on the sun sparkling stream of prosperity where i had last seen him it was a great shock to me to find him in such a condition of poverty and squalor and to see a man who had originated the conundrum of the anvil reduced to the soul depressing occupation of grinding pin points as i walked and thought the dreadful picture of a totally eclipsed future arose before my mind the moral of barbel sank deep into my heart when i reached home i told my wife the story of my friend barbel she listened with a sad and eager interest i am afraid she said if our fortunes do not quickly mend that we shall have to buy two little grindstones you know i could help you at that sort of thing for a long time we sat together and talked and devised many plans for the future i did not think it necessary yet for me to look out for a pin contract but i must find some way of making money or we should starve to death of course the first thing that suggested itself was the possibility of finding some other business but apart from the difficulty of immediately obtaining remunerative work in occupations to which i had not been trained i felt a great and natural reluctance to give up a profession for which i had carefully prepared myself and which i had adopted as my life work it would be very hard for me to lay down my pen forever and to close the top of my inkstand upon all the bright and happy fancies which i had seen mirrored in its tranquil pool we talked and pondered the rest of that day and a good deal of the night but we came to no conclusion as to what it would be best for us to do the next day i determined to go and call upon the editor of the journal for which in happier days before the blight of his wife's deceased sister rested upon me i used most frequently to write and having frankly explained my condition to him to ask his advice the editor was a good man and had always been my friend he listened with great attention to what i told him and evidently sympathized with me in my trouble as we have written to you he said the only reason why we did not accept the manuscripts you sent us was that they would have disappointed the high hopes that the public had formed in regard to you we have had letter after letter asking when we were going to publish another story like his wife's deceased sister we felt and we still feel that it would be wrong to allow you to destroy the fair fabric which you yourself have raised but he added with a kind smile i see very plainly that your well deserved reputation will be of little advantage to you if you should starve at the moment that its genial beams are so to speak lighting you up its beams are not genial i answered they have scorched and withered me how would you like said the editor after a short reflection to allow us to publish the stories you have recently written under some other name than your own that would satisfy us and the public would put money in your pocket and would not interfere with your reputation joyfully i seized the noble fellow by the hand and instantly accepted his proposition of course said i a reputation is a very good thing but no reputation can take the place of food clothes and a house to live in and i gladly agree to sink my over illumined name into oblivion and to appear before the public as a new and unknown writer i hope that need not be for long he said for i feel sure that you will yet write stories as good as his wife's deceased sister all the manuscripts i had on hand i now sent to my good friend the editor and in due and proper order they appeared in his journal under the name of john darmstadt which i had selected as a substitute for my own permanently disabled i made a similar arrangement with other editors and john darmstadt received the credit of everything that proceeded from my pen our circumstances now became very comfortable and occasionally we even allowed ourselves to indulge in little dreams of prosperity time passed on very pleasantly one year another and then a little son was born to us it is often difficult i believe for thoughtful persons to decide whether the beginning of their conjugal career or the earliest weeks in the life of their first born be the happiest and proudest period of their existence for myself i can only say that the same exaltation of mind the same rarefication of idea and invention which succeeded upon my wedding day came upon me now as then my ecstatic emotions crystallized themselves into a motive for a story and without delay i set myself to work upon it my boy was about six weeks old when the manuscript was finished and one evening as we sat before a comfortable fire in our sitting room with the curtains drawn and the soft lamp lighted and the baby sleeping soundly in the adjoining chamber i read the story to my wife when i had finished my wife arose and threw herself into my arms i was never so proud of you she said her glad eyes sparkling as i am at this moment that is a wonderful story it is indeed i am sure it is just as good as his wife's deceased sister as she spoke these words a sudden and chilling sensation crept over us both all her warmth and fervor and the proud and happy glow engendered within me by this praise and appreciation from one i loved vanished in an instant we stepped apart and gazed upon each other with pallid faces in the same moment the terrible truth had flashed upon us both this story was as good as his wife's deceased sister we stood silent the exceptional lot of barbel's super pointed pins seemed to pierce our very souls a dreadful vision rose before me of an impending fall and crash in which our domestic happiness should vanish and our prospects for our boy be wrecked just as we had began to build them up my wife approached me and took my hand in hers which was as cold as ice be strong and firm she said a great danger threatens us but you must brace yourself against it be strong and firm i pressed her hand and we said no more that night the next day i took the manuscript i had just written and carefully infolded it in stout wrapping paper then i went to a neighboring grocery store and bought a small strong tin box originally intended for biscuit with a cover that fitted tightly in this i placed my manuscript and then i took the box to a tinsmith and had the top fastened on with hard solder when i went home i ascended into the garret and brought down to my study a ship's cash box which had once belonged to one of my family who was a sea captain this box was very heavy and firmly bound with iron and was secured by two massive locks calling my wife i told her of the contents of the tin case which i then placed in the box and having shut down the heavy lid i doubly locked it this key said i putting it in my pocket i shall throw into the river when i go out this afternoon my wife watched me eagerly with a pallid and firm set countenance but upon which i could see the faint glimmer of returning happiness wouldn't it be well she said to secure it still further by sealing wax and pieces of tape no said i i do not believe that any one will attempt to tamper with our prosperity and now my dear i continued in an impressive voice no one but you and in the course of time our son shall know that this manuscript exists when i am dead those who survive me may if they see fit cause this box to be split open and the story published the reputation it may give my name cannot harm me then the widow's cruise the widow ducket lived in a small village about ten miles from the new jersey sea coast in this village she was born here she had married and buried her husband and here she expected somebody to bury her but she was in no hurry for this for she had scarcely reached middle age she was a tall woman with no apparent fat in her composition and full of activity both muscular and mental she rose at six o'clock in the morning cooked breakfast set the table washed the dishes when the meal was over milked churned swept washed ironed worked in her little garden attended to the flowers in the front yard and in the afternoon knitted and quilted and sewed and after tea she either went to see her neighbors or had them come to see her when it was really dark she lighted the lamp in her"
