"1" "stern he is indeed the best of animals replied rat so simple so good natured and so affectionate perhaps he's not very clever we can't all be geniuses and it may be that he is both boastful and conceited but he has got some great qualities has toady rounding a bend in the river they came in sight of a handsome dignified old house of mellowed red brick with well kept lawns reaching down to the water's edge there's toad hall said the rat and that creek on the left where the notice board says private no landing allowed leads to his boat house where we'll leave the boat the stables are over there to the right that's the banqueting hall you're looking at now very old that is toad is rather rich you know and this is really one of the nicest houses in these parts though we never admit as much to toad they glided up the creek and the mole shipped his sculls as they passed into the shadow of a large boat house here they saw many handsome boats slung from the cross beams or hauled up on a slip but none in the water and the place had an unused and a deserted air the rat looked around him i understand said he boating is played out he's tired of it and done with it i wonder what new fad he has taken up now come along and let's look him up we shall hear all about it quite soon enough they disembarked and strolled across the gay flower decked lawns in search of toad whom they presently happened upon resting in a wicker garden chair with a pre occupied expression of face and a large map spread out on his knees hooray he cried jumping up on seeing them this is splendid he shook the paws of both of them warmly never waiting for an introduction to the mole how kind of you he went on dancing round them i was just going to send a boat down the river for you ratty with strict orders that you were to be fetched up here at once whatever you were doing i want you badly both of you now what will you take come inside and have something you don't know how lucky it is your turning up just now let's sit quiet a bit toady said the rat throwing himself into an easy chair while the mole took another by the side of him and made some civil remark about toad's delightful residence finest house on the whole river cried toad boisterously or anywhere else for that matter he could not help adding here the rat nudged the mole unfortunately the toad saw him do it and turned very red there was a moment's painful silence then toad burst out laughing all right ratty he said it's only my way you know and it's not such a very bad house is it you know you rather like it yourself now look here let's be sensible you are the very animals i wanted you've got to help me it's most important it's about your rowing i suppose said the rat with an innocent air you're getting on fairly well though you splash a good bit still with a great deal of patience and any quantity of coaching you may o pooh boating interrupted the toad in great disgust silly boyish amusement i've given that up long ago sheer waste of time that's what it is it makes me downright sorry to see you fellows who ought to know better spending all your energies in that aimless manner no i've discovered the real thing the only genuine occupation for a life time i propose to devote the remainder of mine to it and can only regret the wasted years that lie behind me squandered in trivialities come with me dear ratty and your amiable friend also if he will be so very good just as far as the stable yard and you shall see what you shall see he led the way to the stable yard accordingly the rat following with a most mistrustful expression and there drawn out of the coach house into the open they saw a gipsy caravan shining with newness painted a canary yellow picked out with green and red wheels there you are cried the toad straddling and expanding himself there's real life for you embodied in that little cart the open road the dusty highway the heath the common the hedgerows the rolling downs camps villages towns cities here to day up and off to somewhere else to morrow travel change interest excitement the whole world before you and a horizon that's always changing and mind this is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built without any exception come inside and look at the arrangements planned em all myself i did the mole was tremendously interested and excited and followed him eagerly up the steps and into the interior of the caravan the rat only snorted and thrust his hands deep into his pockets remaining where he was it was indeed very compact and comfortable little sleeping bunks a little table that folded up against the wall a cooking stove lockers bookshelves a bird cage with a bird in it and pots pans jugs and kettles of every size and variety all complete said the toad triumphantly pulling open a locker you see biscuits potted lobster sardines everything you can possibly want soda water here baccy there letter paper bacon jam cards and dominoes you'll find he continued as they descended the steps again you'll find that nothing what ever has been forgotten when we make our start this afternoon i beg your pardon said the rat slowly as he chewed a straw but did i overhear you say something about we and start and this afternoon now you dear good old ratty said toad imploringly don't begin talking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way because you know you've got to come i can't possibly manage without you so please consider it settled and don't argue it's the one thing i can't stand you surely don't mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life and just live in a hole in a bank and boat i want to show you the world i'm going to make an animal of you my boy i don't care said the rat doggedly i'm not coming and that's flat and i am going to stick to my old river and live in a hole and boat as i've always done and what's more mole's going to stick to me and do as i do aren't you mole of course i am said the mole loyally i'll always stick to you rat and what you say is to be has got to be all the same it sounds as if it might have been well rather fun you know he added wistfully poor mole the life adventurous was so new a thing to him and so thrilling and this fresh aspect of it was so tempting and he had fallen in love at first sight with the canary coloured cart and all its little fitments the rat saw what was passing in his mind and wavered he hated disappointing people and he was fond of the mole and would do almost anything to oblige him toad was watching both of them closely come along in and have some lunch he said diplomatically and we'll talk it over we needn't decide anything in a hurry of course _i_ don't really care i only want to give pleasure to you fellows live for others that's my motto in life during luncheon which was excellent of course as everything at toad hall always was the toad simply let himself go disregarding the rat he proceeded to play upon the inexperienced mole as on a harp naturally a voluble animal and always mastered by his imagination he painted the prospects of the trip and the joys of the open life and the roadside in such glowing colours that the mole could hardly sit in his chair for excitement somehow it soon seemed taken for granted by all three of them that the trip was a settled thing and the rat though still unconvinced in his mind allowed his good nature to over ride his personal objections he could not bear to disappoint his two friends who were already deep in schemes and anticipations planning out each day's separate occupation for several weeks ahead when they were quite ready the now triumphant toad led his companions to the paddock and set them to capture the old grey horse who without having been consulted and to his own extreme annoyance had been told off by toad for the dustiest job in this dusty expedition he frankly preferred the paddock and took a deal of catching meantime toad packed the lockers still tighter with necessaries and hung nosebags nets of onions bundles of hay and baskets from the bottom of the cart at last the horse was caught and harnessed and they set off all talking at once each animal either trudging by the side of the cart or sitting on the shaft as the humour took him it was a golden afternoon the smell of the dust they kicked up was rich and satisfying out of thick orchards on either side the road birds called and whistled to them cheerily good natured wayfarers passing them gave them good day or stopped to say nice things about their beautiful cart and rabbits sitting at their front doors in the hedgerows held up their fore paws and said o my o my o my late in the evening tired and happy and miles from home they drew up on a remote common far from habitations turned the horse loose to graze and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass by the side of the cart toad talked big about all he was going to do in the days to come while stars grew fuller and larger all around them and a yellow moon appearing suddenly and silently from nowhere in particular came to keep them company and listen to their talk at last they turned in to their little bunks in the cart and toad kicking out his legs sleepily said well good night you fellows this is the real life for a gentleman talk about your old river i don't talk about my river replied the patient rat you know i don't toad but i think about it he added pathetically in a lower tone i think about it all the time the mole reached out from under his blanket felt for the rat's paw in the darkness and gave it a squeeze i'll do whatever you like ratty he whispered shall we run away to morrow morning quite early very early and go back to our dear old hole on the river no no we'll see it out whispered back the rat thanks awfully but i ought to stick by toad till this trip is ended it wouldn't be safe for him to be left to himself it won't take very long his fads never do good night the end was indeed nearer than even the rat suspected after so much open air and excitement the toad slept very soundly and no amount of shaking could rouse him out of bed next morning so the mole and rat turned to quietly and manfully and while the rat saw to the horse and lit a fire and cleaned last night's cups and platters and got things ready for breakfast the mole trudged off to the nearest village a long way off for milk and eggs and various necessaries the toad had of course forgotten to provide the hard work had all been done and the two animals were resting thoroughly exhausted by the time toad appeared on the scene fresh and gay remarking what a pleasant easy life it was they were all leading now after the cares and worries and fatigues of housekeeping at home they had a pleasant ramble that day over grassy downs and along narrow by lanes and camped as before on a common only this time the two guests took care that toad should do his fair share of work in consequence when the time came for starting next morning toad was by no means so rapturous about the simplicity of the primitive life and indeed attempted to resume his place in his bunk whence he was hauled by force their way lay as before across country by narrow lanes and it was not till the afternoon that they came out on the high road their first high road and there disaster fleet and unforeseen sprang out on them disaster momentous indeed to their expedition but simply overwhelming in its effect on the after career of toad they were strolling along the high road easily the mole by the horse's head talking to him since the horse had complained that he was being frightfully left out of it and nobody considered him in the least the toad and the water rat walking behind the cart talking together at least toad was talking and rat was saying at intervals yes precisely and what did you say to him and thinking all the time of something very different when far behind them they heard a faint warning hum like the drone of a distant bee glancing back they saw a small cloud of dust with a dark centre of energy advancing on them at incredible speed while from out the dust a faint poop poop wailed like an uneasy animal in pain hardly regarding it they turned to resume their conversation when in an instant as it seemed the peaceful scene was changed and with a blast of wind and a whirl of sound that made them jump for the nearest ditch it was on them the poop poop rang with a brazen shout in their ears they had a moment's glimpse of an interior of glittering plate glass and rich morocco and the magnificent motor car immense breath snatching passionate with its pilot tense and hugging his wheel possessed all earth and air for the fraction of a second flung an enveloping cloud of dust that blinded and enwrapped them utterly and then dwindled to a speck in the far distance changed back into a droning bee once more the old grey horse dreaming as he plodded along of his quiet paddock in a new raw situation such as this simply abandoned himself to his natural emotions rearing plunging backing steadily in spite of all the mole's efforts at his head and all the mole's lively language directed at his better feelings he drove the cart backwards towards the deep ditch at the side of the road it wavered an instant then there was a heartrending crash and the canary coloured cart their pride and their joy lay on its side in the ditch an irredeemable wreck the rat danced up and down in the road simply transported with passion you villains he shouted shaking both fists you scoundrels you highwaymen you you roadhogs i'll have the law of you i'll report you i'll take you through all the courts his home sickness had quite slipped away from him and for the moment he was the skipper of the canary coloured vessel driven on a shoal by the reckless jockeying of rival mariners and he was trying to recollect all the fine and biting things he used to say to masters of steam launches when their wash as they drove too near the bank used to flood his parlour carpet at home toad sat straight down in the middle of the dusty road his legs stretched out before him and stared fixedly in the direction of the disappearing motor car he breathed short his face wore a placid satisfied expression and at intervals he faintly murmured poop poop the mole was busy trying to quiet the horse which he succeeded in doing after a time then he went to look at the cart on its side in the ditch it was indeed a sorry sight panels and windows smashed axles hopelessly bent one wheel off sardine tins scattered over the wide world and the bird in the bird cage sobbing pitifully and calling to be let out the rat came to help him but their united efforts were not sufficient to right the cart hi toad they cried come and bear a hand can't you the toad never answered a word or budged from his seat in the road so they went to see what was the matter with him they found him in a sort of a trance a happy smile on his face his eyes still fixed on the dusty wake of their destroyer at intervals he was still heard to murmur poop poop the rat shook him by the shoulder are you coming to help us toad he demanded sternly glorious stirring sight murmured toad never offering to move the poetry of motion the real way to travel the only way to travel here to day in next week to morrow villages skipped towns and cities jumped always somebody else's horizon o bliss o poop poop o my o my o stop being an ass toad cried the mole despairingly and to think i never knew went on the toad in a dreamy monotone all those wasted years that lie behind me i never knew never even dreamt but now but now that i know now that i fully realise o what a flowery track lies spread before me henceforth what dust clouds shall spring up behind me as i speed on my reckless way what carts i shall fling carelessly into the ditch in the wake of my magnificent onset horrid little carts common carts canary coloured carts what are we to do with him asked the mole of the water rat nothing at all replied the rat firmly because there is really nothing to be done you see i know him from of old he is now possessed he has got a new craze and it always takes him that way in its first stage he'll continue like that for days now like an animal walking in a happy dream quite useless for all practical purposes never mind him let's go and see what there is to be done about the cart a careful inspection showed them that even if they succeeded in righting it by themselves the cart would travel no longer the axles were in a hopeless state and the missing wheel was shattered into pieces the rat knotted the horse's reins over his back and took him by the head carrying the bird cage and its hysterical occupant in the other hand come on he said grimly to the mole it's five or six miles to the nearest town and we shall just have to walk it the sooner we make a start the better but what about toad asked the mole anxiously as they set off together we can't leave him here sitting in the middle of the road by himself in the distracted state he's in it's not safe supposing another thing were to come along o bother toad said the rat savagely i've done with him they had not proceeded very far on their way however when there was a pattering of feet behind them and toad caught them up and thrust a paw inside the elbow of each of them still breathing short and staring into vacancy now look here toad said the rat sharply as soon as we get to the town you'll have to go straight to the police station and see if they know anything about that motor car and who it belongs to and lodge a complaint against it and then you'll have to go to a blacksmith's or a wheelwright's and arrange for the cart to be fetched and mended and put to rights it'll take time but it's not quite a hopeless smash meanwhile the mole and i will go to an inn and find comfortable rooms where we can stay till the cart's ready and till your nerves have recovered their shock police station complaint murmured toad dreamily me complain of that beautiful that heavenly vision that has been vouchsafed me mend the cart i've done with carts for ever i never want to see the cart or to hear of it again o ratty you can't think how obliged i am to you for consenting to come on this trip i wouldn't have gone without you and then i might never have seen that that swan that sunbeam that thunderbolt i might never have heard that entrancing sound or smelt that bewitching smell i owe it all to you my best of friends the rat turned from him in despair you see what it is he said to the mole addressing him across toad's head he's quite hopeless i give it up when we get to the town we'll go to the railway station and with luck we may pick up a train there that'll get us back to riverbank to night and if ever you catch me going a pleasuring with this provoking animal again he snorted and during the rest of that weary trudge addressed his remarks exclusively to mole on reaching the town they went straight to the station and deposited toad in the second class waiting room giving a porter twopence to keep a strict eye on him they then left the horse at an inn stable and gave what directions they could about the cart and its contents eventually a slow train having landed them at a station not very far from toad hall they escorted the spell bound sleep walking toad to his door put him inside it and instructed his housekeeper to feed him undress him and put him to bed then they got out their boat from the boat house sculled down the river home and at a very late hour sat down to supper in their own cosy riverside parlour to the rat's great joy and contentment the following evening the mole who had risen late and taken things very easy all day was sitting on the bank fishing when the rat who had been looking up his friends and gossiping came strolling along to find him heard the news he said there's nothing else being talked about all along the river bank toad went up to town by an early train this morning and he has ordered a large and very expensive motor car iii the wild wood the mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the badger he seemed by all accounts to be such an important personage and though rarely visible to make his unseen influence felt by everybody about the place but whenever the mole mentioned his wish to the water rat he always found himself put off it's all right the rat would say badger'll turn up some day or other he's always turning up and then i'll introduce you the best of fellows but you must not only take him as you find him but when you find him couldn't you ask him here dinner or something said the mole he wouldn't come replied the rat simply badger hates society and invitations and dinner and all that sort of thing well then supposing we go and call on him suggested the mole o i'm sure he wouldn't like that at all said the rat quite alarmed he's so very shy he'd be sure to be offended i've never even ventured to call on him at his own home myself though i know him so well besides we can't it's quite out of the question because he lives in the very middle of the wild wood well supposing he does said the mole you told me the wild wood was all right you know o i know i know so it is replied the rat evasively but i think we won't go there just now not just yet it's a long way and he wouldn't be at home at this time of year anyhow and he'll be coming along some day if you'll wait quietly the mole had to be content with this but the badger never came along and every day brought its amusements and it was not till summer was long over and cold and frost and miry ways kept them much indoors and the swollen river raced past outside their windows with a speed that mocked at boating of any sort or kind that he found his thoughts dwelling again with much persistence on the solitary grey badger who lived his own life by himself in his hole in the middle of the wild wood in the winter time the rat slept a great deal retiring early and rising late during his short day he sometimes scribbled poetry or did other small domestic jobs about the house and of course there were always animals dropping in for a chat and consequently there was a good deal of story telling and comparing notes on the past summer and all its doings such a rich chapter it had been when one came to look back on it all with illustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured the pageant of the river bank had marched steadily along unfolding itself in scene pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession purple loosestrife arrived early shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the edge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it willow herb tender and wistful like a pink sunset cloud was not slow to follow comfrey the purple hand in hand with the white crept forth to take its place in the line and at last one morning the diffident and delaying dog rose stepped delicately on the stage and one knew as if string music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a gavotte that june at last was here one member of the company was still awaited the shepherd boy for the nymphs to woo the knight for whom the ladies waited at the window the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to life and love but when meadow sweet debonair and odorous in amber jerkin moved graciously to his place in the group then the play was ready to begin and what a play it had been drowsy animals snug in their holes while wind and rain were battering at their doors recalled still keen mornings an hour before sunrise when the white mist as yet undispersed clung closely along the surface of the water then the shock of the early plunge the scamper along the bank and the radiant transformation of earth air and water when suddenly the sun was with them again and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the earth once more they recalled the languorous siesta of hot mid day deep in green undergrowth the sun striking through in tiny golden shafts and spots the boating and bathing of the afternoon the rambles along dusty lanes and through yellow cornfields and the long cool evening at last when so many threads were gathered up so many friendships rounded and so many adventures planned for the morrow there was plenty to talk about on those short winter days when the animals found themselves round the fire still the mole had a good deal of spare time on his hands and so one afternoon when the rat in his arm chair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over rhymes that wouldn't fit he formed the resolution to go out by himself and explore the wild wood and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with mr badger it was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead when he slipped out of the warm parlour into the open air the country lay bare and entirely leafless around him and he thought that he had never seen so far and so intimately into the insides of things as on that winter day when nature was deep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked the clothes off copses dells quarries and all hidden places which had been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer now exposed themselves and their secrets pathetically and seemed to ask him to overlook their shabby poverty for a while till they could riot in rich masquerade as before and trick and entice him with the old deceptions it was pitiful in a way and yet cheering even exhilarating he was glad that he liked the country undecorated hard and stripped of its finery he had got down to the bare bones of it and they were fine and strong and simple he did not want the warm clover and the play of seeding grasses the screens of quickset the billowy drapery of beech and elm seemed best away and with great cheerfulness of spirit he pushed on towards the wild wood which lay before him low and threatening like a black reef in some still southern sea there was nothing to alarm him at first entry twigs crackled under his feet logs tripped him funguses on stumps resembled caricatures and startled him for the moment by their likeness to something familiar and far away but that was all fun and exciting it led him on and he penetrated to where the light was less and trees crouched nearer and nearer and holes made ugly mouths at him on"
