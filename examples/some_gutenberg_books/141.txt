to them the little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all and not least of herself necessarily wore away and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle nor did her aunt norris's voice make her start very much to her cousins she became occasionally an acceptable companion though unworthy from inferiority of age and strength to be their constant associate their pleasures and schemes were sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful especially when that third was of an obliging yielding temper and they could not but own when their aunt inquired into her faults or their brother edmund urged her claims to their kindness that fanny was good natured enough edmund was uniformly kind himself and she had nothing worse to endure on the part of tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten he was just entering into life full of spirits and with all the liberal dispositions of an eldest son who feels born only for expense and enjoyment his kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights he made her some very pretty presents and laughed at her as her appearance and spirits improved sir thomas and mrs norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan and it was pretty soon decided between them that though far from clever she showed a tractable disposition and seemed likely to give them little trouble a mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_ fanny could read work and write but she had been taught nothing more and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar they thought her prodigiously stupid and for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing room dear mama only think my cousin cannot put the map of europe together or my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in russia or she never heard of asia minor or she does not know the difference between water colours and crayons how strange did you ever hear anything so stupid my dear their considerate aunt would reply it is very bad but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself but aunt she is really so very ignorant do you know we asked her last night which way she would go to get to ireland and she said she should cross to the isle of wight she thinks of nothing but the isle of wight and she calls it _the_ _island_ as if there were no other island in the world i am sure i should have been ashamed of myself if i had not known better long before i was so old as she is i cannot remember the time when i did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet how long ago it is aunt since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of england with the dates of their accession and most of the principal events of their reigns yes added the other and of the roman emperors as low as severus besides a great deal of the heathen mythology and all the metals semi metals planets and distinguished philosophers very true indeed my dears but you are blessed with wonderful memories and your poor cousin has probably none at all there is a vast deal of difference in memories as well as in everything else and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin and pity her deficiency and remember that if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves you should always be modest for much as you know already there is a great deal more for you to learn yes i know there is till i am seventeen but i must tell you another thing of fanny so odd and so stupid do you know she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing to be sure my dear that is very stupid indeed and shows a great want of genius and emulation but all things considered i do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so for though you know owing to me your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are on the contrary it is much more desirable that there should be a difference such were the counsels by which mrs norris assisted to form her nieces minds and it is not very wonderful that with all their promising talents and early information they should be entirely deficient in the less common acquirements of self knowledge generosity and humility in everything but disposition they were admirably taught sir thomas did not know what was wanting because though a truly anxious father he was not outwardly affectionate and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him to the education of her daughters lady bertram paid not the smallest attention she had not time for such cares she was a woman who spent her days in sitting nicely dressed on a sofa doing some long piece of needlework of little use and no beauty thinking more of her pug than her children but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to inconvenience guided in everything important by sir thomas and in smaller concerns by her sister had she possessed greater leisure for the service of her girls she would probably have supposed it unnecessary for they were under the care of a governess with proper masters and could want nothing more as for fanny's being stupid at learning she could only say it was very unlucky but some people _were_ stupid and fanny must take more pains she did not know what else was to be done and except her being so dull she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages and fetching what she wanted fanny with all her faults of ignorance and timidity was fixed at mansfield park and learning to transfer in its favour much of her attachment to her former home grew up there not unhappily among her cousins there was no positive ill nature in maria or julia and though fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured by it from about the time of her entering the family lady bertram in consequence of a little ill health and a great deal of indolence gave up the house in town which she had been used to occupy every spring and remained wholly in the country leaving sir thomas to attend his duty in parliament with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence in the country therefore the miss bertrams continued to exercise their memories practise their duets and grow tall and womanly and their father saw them becoming in person manner and accomplishments everything that could satisfy his anxiety his eldest son was careless and extravagant and had already given him much uneasiness but his other children promised him nothing but good his daughters he felt while they retained the name of bertram must be giving it new grace and in quitting it he trusted would extend its respectable alliances and the character of edmund his strong good sense and uprightness of mind bid most fairly for utility honour and happiness to himself and all his connexions he was to be a clergyman amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested sir thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of mrs price he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit and fanny though almost totally separated from her family was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them or of anything at all promising in their situation or conduct once and once only in the course of many years had she the happiness of being with william of the rest she saw nothing nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again even for a visit nobody at home seemed to want her but william determining soon after her removal to be a sailor was invited to spend a week with his sister in northamptonshire before he went to sea their eager affection in meeting their exquisite delight in being together their hours of happy mirth and moments of serious conference may be imagined as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even to the last and the misery of the girl when he left her luckily the visit happened in the christmas holidays when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin edmund and he told her such charming things of what william was to do and be hereafter in consequence of his profession as made her gradually admit that the separation might have some use edmund's friendship never failed her his leaving eton for oxford made no change in his kind dispositions and only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them without any display of doing more than the rest or any fear of doing too much he was always true to her interests and considerate of her feelings trying to make her good qualities understood and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent giving her advice consolation and encouragement kept back as she was by everybody else his single support could not bring her forward but his attentions were otherwise of the highest importance in assisting the improvement of her mind and extending its pleasures he knew her to be clever to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense and a fondness for reading which properly directed must be an education in itself miss lee taught her french and heard her read the daily portion of history but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours he encouraged her taste and corrected her judgment he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read and heightened its attraction by judicious praise in return for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except william her heart was divided between the two chapter iii the first event of any importance in the family was the death of mr norris which happened when fanny was about fifteen and necessarily introduced alterations and novelties mrs norris on quitting the parsonage removed first to the park and afterwards to a small house of sir thomas's in the village and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy the living was hereafter for edmund and had his uncle died a few years sooner it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders but tom's extravagance had previous to that event been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder there was another family living actually held for edmund but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to sir thomas's conscience he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do i blush for you tom said he in his most dignified manner i blush for the expedient which i am driven on and i trust i may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion you have robbed edmund for ten twenty thirty years perhaps for life of more than half the income which ought to be his it may hereafter be in my power or in yours i hope it will to procure him better preferment but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us and that nothing can in fact be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts tom listened with some shame and some sorrow but escaping as quickly as possible could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect firstly that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends secondly that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it and thirdly that the future incumbent whoever he might be would in all probability die very soon on mr norris's death the presentation became the right of a dr grant who came consequently to reside at mansfield and on proving to be a hearty man of forty five seemed likely to disappoint mr bertram's calculations but no he was a short necked apoplectic sort of fellow and plied well with good things would soon pop off he had a wife about fifteen years his junior but no children and they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very respectable agreeable people the time was now come when sir thomas expected his sister in law to claim her share in their niece the change in mrs norris's situation and the improvement in fanny's age seeming not merely to do away any former objection to their living together but even to give it the most decided eligibility and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore by some recent losses on his west india estate in addition to his eldest son's extravagance it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support and the obligation of her future provision in the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be he mentioned its probability to his wife and the first time of the subject's occurring to her again happening to be when fanny was present she calmly observed to her so fanny you are going to leave us and live with my sister how shall you like it fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt's words going to leave you yes my dear why should you be astonished you have been five years with us and my sister always meant to take you when mr norris died but you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same the news was as disagreeable to fanny as it had been unexpected she had never received kindness from her aunt norris and could not love her i shall be very sorry to go away said she with a faltering voice yes i dare say you will _that's_ natural enough i suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world i hope i am not ungrateful aunt said fanny modestly no my dear i hope not i have always found you a very good girl and am i never to live here again never my dear but you are sure of a comfortable home it can make very little difference to you whether you are in one house or the other fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart she could not feel the difference to be so small she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction as soon as she met with edmund she told him her distress cousin said she something is going to happen which i do not like at all and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that i disliked at first you will not be able to do it now i am going to live entirely with my aunt norris indeed yes my aunt bertram has just told me so it is quite settled i am to leave mansfield park and go to the white house i suppose as soon as she is removed there well fanny and if the plan were not unpleasant to you i should call it an excellent one oh cousin it has everything else in its favour my aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you she is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought and i am glad her love of money does not interfere you will be what you ought to be to her i hope it does not distress you very much fanny indeed it does i cannot like it i love this house and everything in it i shall love nothing there you know how uncomfortable i feel with her i can say nothing for her manner to you as a child but it was the same with us all or nearly so she never knew how to be pleasant to children but you are now of an age to be treated better i think she is behaving better already and when you are her only companion you _must_ be important to her i can never be important to any one what is to prevent you everything my situation my foolishness and awkwardness as to your foolishness and awkwardness my dear fanny believe me you never have a shadow of either but in using the words so improperly there is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known you have good sense and a sweet temper and i am sure you have a grateful heart that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it i do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion you are too kind said fanny colouring at such praise how shall i ever thank you as i ought for thinking so well of me oh cousin if i am to go away i shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life why indeed fanny i should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the white house you speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park but you will belong to us almost as much as ever the two families will be meeting every day in the year the only difference will be that living with your aunt you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be _here_ there are too many whom you can hide behind but with _her_ you will be forced to speak for yourself oh i do not say so i must say it and say it with pleasure mrs norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now she is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers fanny sighed and said i cannot see things as you do but i ought to believe you to be right rather than myself and i am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be if i could suppose my aunt really to care for me it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody _here_ i know i am of none and yet i love the place so well the place fanny is what you will not quit though you quit the house you will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever even _your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change you will have the same walks to frequent the same library to choose from the same people to look at the same horse to ride very true yes dear old grey pony ah cousin when i remember how much i used to dread riding what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good oh how i have trembled at my uncle's opening his lips if horses were talked of and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears and convince me that i should like it after a little while and feel how right you proved to be i am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well and i am quite convinced that your being with mrs norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health and as much for your ultimate happiness too so ended their discourse which for any very appropriate service it could render fanny might as well have been spared for mrs norris had not the smallest intention of taking her it had never occurred to her on the present occasion but as a thing to be carefully avoided to prevent its being expected she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the buildings of mansfield parish the white house being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants and allow a spare room for a friend of which she made a very particular point the spare rooms at the parsonage had never been wanted but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now never forgotten not all her precautions however could save her from being suspected of something better or perhaps her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled sir thomas to suppose it really intended for fanny lady bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to mrs norris i think sister we need not keep miss lee any longer when fanny goes to live with you mrs norris almost started live with me dear lady bertram what do you mean is she not to live with you i thought you had settled it with sir thomas me never i never spoke a syllable about it to sir thomas nor he to me fanny live with me the last thing in the world for me to think of or for anybody to wish that really knows us both good heaven what could i do with fanny me a poor helpless forlorn widow unfit for anything my spirits quite broke down what could i do with a girl at her time of life a girl of fifteen the very age of all others to need most attention and care and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test sure sir thomas could not seriously expect such a thing sir thomas is too much my friend nobody that wishes me well i am sure would propose it how came sir thomas to speak to you about it indeed i do not know i suppose he thought it best but what did he say he could not say he _wished_ me to take fanny i am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it no he only said he thought it very likely and i thought so too we both thought it would be a comfort to you but if you do not like it there is no more to be said she is no encumbrance here dear sister if you consider my unhappy state how can she be any comfort to me here am i a poor desolate widow deprived of the best of husbands my health gone in attending and nursing him my spirits still worse all my peace in this world destroyed with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed what possible comfort could i have in taking such a charge upon me as fanny if i could wish it for my own sake i would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl she is in good hands and sure of doing well i must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as i can then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone lady bertram i do not complain i know i cannot live as i have done but i must retrench where i can and learn to be a better manager i _have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough but i shall not be ashamed to practise economy now my situation is as much altered as my income a great many things were due from poor mr norris as clergyman of the parish that cannot be expected from me it is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers at the white house matters must be better looked after i _must_ live within my income or i shall be miserable and i own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more to lay by a little at the end of the year i dare say you will you always do don't you my object lady bertram is to be of use to those that come after me it is for your children's good that i wish to be richer i have nobody else to care for but i should be very glad to think i could leave a little trifle among them worth their having you are very good but do not trouble yourself about them they are sure of being well provided for sir thomas will take care of that why you know sir thomas's means will be rather straitened if the antigua estate is to make such poor returns oh _that_ will soon be settled sir thomas has been writing about it i know well lady bertram said mrs norris moving to go i can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family and so if sir thomas should ever speak again about my taking fanny you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question besides that i really should not have a bed to give her for i must keep a spare room for a friend lady bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister in law's views and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation or the slightest allusion to it from him he could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt but as she took early care to make him as well as lady bertram understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them would enable him better to provide for fanny himself fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal and her spontaneous untaught felicity on the discovery conveyed some consolation to edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her mrs norris took possession of the white house the grants arrived at the parsonage and these events over everything at mansfield went on for some time as usual the grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance they had their faults and mrs norris soon found them out the doctor was very fond of eating and would have a good dinner every day and mrs grant instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense gave her cook as high wages as they did at mansfield park and was scarcely ever seen in her offices mrs norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself nobody more hated pitiful doings the parsonage she believed had never been wanting in comforts of any sort had never borne a bad character in _her_ _time_ but this was a way of going on that she could not understand a fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place _her_ store room she thought might have been good enough for mrs grant to go into inquire where she would she could not find out that mrs grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds lady bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective she could not enter into the wrongs of an economist but she felt all the injuries of beauty in mrs grant's being so well settled in life without being handsome and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often though not so diffusely as mrs norris discussed the other these opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies sir thomas found it expedient to go to antigua himself for the better arrangement of his affairs and he took his eldest son with him in the hope"
