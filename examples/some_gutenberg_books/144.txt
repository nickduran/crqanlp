"1" "are too many for me rachel was heard to sigh poor little goats if it weren't for the goats there'd be no music my dear music depends upon goats said her father rather sharply and mr pepper went on to describe the white hairless blind monsters lying curled on the ridges of sand at the bottom of the sea which would explode if you brought them to the surface their sides bursting asunder and scattering entrails to the winds when released from pressure with considerable detail and with such show of knowledge that ridley was disgusted and begged him to stop from all this helen drew her own conclusions which were gloomy enough pepper was a bore rachel was an unlicked girl no doubt prolific of confidences the very first of which would be you see i don't get on with my father willoughby as usual loved his business and built his empire and between them all she would be considerably bored being a woman of action however she rose and said that for her part she was going to bed at the door she glanced back instinctively at rachel expecting that as two of the same sex they would leave the room together rachel rose looked vaguely into helen's face and remarked with her slight stammer i'm going out to t t triumph in the wind mrs ambrose's worst suspicions were confirmed she went down the passage lurching from side to side and fending off the wall now with her right arm now with her left at each lurch she exclaimed emphatically damn chapter ii uncomfortable as the night with its rocking movement and salt smells may have been and in one case undoubtedly was for mr pepper had insufficient clothes upon his bed the breakfast next morning wore a kind of beauty the voyage had begun and had begun happily with a soft blue sky and a calm sea the sense of untapped resources things to say as yet unsaid made the hour significant so that in future years the entire journey perhaps would be represented by this one scene with the sound of sirens hooting in the river the night before somehow mixing in the table was cheerful with apples and bread and eggs helen handed willoughby the butter and as she did so cast her eye on him and reflected and she married you and she was happy i suppose she went off on a familiar train of thought leading on to all kinds of well known reflections from the old wonder why theresa had married willoughby of course one sees all that she thought meaning that one sees that he is big and burly and has a great booming voice and a fist and a will of his own but here she slipped into a fine analysis of him which is best represented by one word sentimental by which she meant that he was never simple and honest about his feelings for example he seldom spoke of the dead but kept anniversaries with singular pomp she suspected him of nameless atrocities with regard to his daughter as indeed she had always suspected him of bullying his wife naturally she fell to comparing her own fortunes with the fortunes of her friend for willoughby's wife had been perhaps the one woman helen called friend and this comparison often made the staple of their talk ridley was a scholar and willoughby was a man of business ridley was bringing out the third volume of pindar when willoughby was launching his first ship they built a new factory the very year the commentary on aristotle was it appeared at the university press and rachel she looked at her meaning no doubt to decide the argument which was otherwise too evenly balanced by declaring that rachel was not comparable to her own children she really might be six years old was all she said however this judgment referring to the smooth unmarked outline of the girl's face and not condemning her otherwise for if rachel were ever to think feel laugh or express herself instead of dropping milk from a height as though to see what kind of drops it made she might be interesting though never exactly pretty she was like her mother as the image in a pool on a still summer's day is like the vivid flushed face that hangs over it meanwhile helen herself was under examination though not from either of her victims mr pepper considered her and his meditations carried on while he cut his toast into bars and neatly buttered them took him through a considerable stretch of autobiography one of his penetrating glances assured him that he was right last night in judging that helen was beautiful blandly he passed her the jam she was talking nonsense but not worse nonsense than people usually do talk at breakfast the cerebral circulation as he knew to his cost being apt to give trouble at that hour he went on saying no to her on principle for he never yielded to a woman on account of her sex and here dropping his eyes to his plate he became autobiographical he had not married himself for the sufficient reason that he had never met a woman who commanded his respect condemned to pass the susceptible years of youth in a railway station in bombay he had seen only coloured women military women official women and his ideal was a woman who could read greek if not persian was irreproachably fair in the face and able to understand the small things he let fall while undressing as it was he had contracted habits of which he was not in the least ashamed certain odd minutes every day went to learning things by heart he never took a ticket without noting the number he devoted january to petronius february to catullus march to the etruscan vases perhaps anyhow he had done good work in india and there was nothing to regret in his life except the fundamental defects which no wise man regrets when the present is still his so concluding he looked up suddenly and smiled rachel caught his eye and now you've chewed something thirty seven times i suppose she thought but said politely aloud are your legs troubling you to day mr pepper my shoulder blades he asked shifting them painfully beauty has no effect upon uric acid that i'm aware of he sighed contemplating the round pane opposite through which the sky and sea showed blue at the same time he took a little parchment volume from his pocket and laid it on the table as it was clear that he invited comment helen asked him the name of it she got the name but she got also a disquisition upon the proper method of making roads beginning with the greeks who had he said many difficulties to contend with he continued with the romans passed to england and the right method which speedily became the wrong method and wound up with such a fury of denunciation directed against the road makers of the present day in general and the road makers of richmond park in particular where mr pepper had the habit of cycling every morning before breakfast that the spoons fairly jingled against the coffee cups and the insides of at least four rolls mounted in a heap beside mr pepper's plate pebbles he concluded viciously dropping another bread pellet upon the heap the roads of england are mended with pebbles with the first heavy rainfall i've told em your road will be a swamp again and again my words have proved true but d'you suppose they listen to me when i tell em so when i point out the consequences the consequences to the public purse when i recommend em to read coryphaeus no mrs ambrose you will form no just opinion of the stupidity of mankind until you have sat upon a borough council the little man fixed her with a glance of ferocious energy i have had servants said mrs ambrose concentrating her gaze at this moment i have a nurse she's a good woman as they go but she's determined to make my children pray so far owing to great care on my part they think of god as a kind of walrus but now that my back's turned ridley she demanded swinging round upon her husband what shall we do if we find them saying the lord's prayer when we get home again ridley made the sound which is represented by tush but willoughby whose discomfort as he listened was manifested by a slight movement rocking of his body said awkwardly oh surely helen a little religion hurts nobody i would rather my children told lies she replied and while willoughby was reflecting that his sister in law was even more eccentric than he remembered pushed her chair back and swept upstairs in a second they heard her calling back oh look we're out at sea they followed her on to the deck all the smoke and the houses had disappeared and the ship was out in a wide space of sea very fresh and clear though pale in the early light they had left london sitting on its mud a very thin line of shadow tapered on the horizon scarcely thick enough to stand the burden of paris which nevertheless rested upon it they were free of roads free of mankind and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through them all the ship was making her way steadily through small waves which slapped her and then fizzled like effervescing water leaving a little border of bubbles and foam on either side the colourless october sky above was thinly clouded as if by the trail of wood fire smoke and the air was wonderfully salt and brisk indeed it was too cold to stand still mrs ambrose drew her arm within her husband's and as they moved off it could be seen from the way in which her sloping cheek turned up to his that she had something private to communicate they went a few paces and rachel saw them kiss down she looked into the depth of the sea while it was slightly disturbed on the surface by the passage of the _euphrosyne_ beneath it was green and dim and it grew dimmer and dimmer until the sand at the bottom was only a pale blur one could scarcely see the black ribs of wrecked ships or the spiral towers made by the burrowings of great eels or the smooth green sided monsters who came by flickering this way and that and rachel if any one wants me i'm busy till one said her father enforcing his words as he often did when he spoke to his daughter by a smart blow upon the shoulder until one he repeated and you'll find yourself some employment eh scales french a little german eh there's mr pepper who knows more about separable verbs than any man in europe eh and he went off laughing rachel laughed too as indeed she had laughed ever since she could remember without thinking it funny but because she admired her father but just as she was turning with a view perhaps to finding some employment she was intercepted by a woman who was so broad and so thick that to be intercepted by her was inevitable the discreet tentative way in which she moved together with her sober black dress showed that she belonged to the lower orders nevertheless she took up a rock like position looking about her to see that no gentry were near before she delivered her message which had reference to the state of the sheets and was of the utmost gravity how ever we're to get through this voyage miss rachel i really can't tell she began with a shake of her head there's only just sheets enough to go round and the master's has a rotten place you could put your fingers through and the counterpanes did you notice the counterpanes i thought to myself a poor person would have been ashamed of them the one i gave mr pepper was hardly fit to cover a dog no miss rachel they could _not_ be mended they're only fit for dust sheets why if one sewed one's finger to the bone one would have one's work undone the next time they went to the laundry her voice in its indignation wavered as if tears were near there was nothing for it but to descend and inspect a large pile of linen heaped upon a table mrs chailey handled the sheets as if she knew each by name character and constitution some had yellow stains others had places where the threads made long ladders but to the ordinary eye they looked much as sheets usually do look very chill white cold and irreproachably clean suddenly mrs chailey turning from the subject of sheets dismissing them entirely clenched her fists on the top of them and proclaimed and you couldn't ask a living creature to sit where i sit mrs chailey was expected to sit in a cabin which was large enough but too near the boilers so that after five minutes she could hear her heart go she complained putting her hand above it which was a state of things that mrs vinrace rachel's mother would never have dreamt of inflicting mrs vinrace who knew every sheet in her house and expected of every one the best they could do but no more it was the easiest thing in the world to grant another room and the problem of sheets simultaneously and miraculously solved itself the spots and ladders not being past cure after all but lies lies lies exclaimed the mistress indignantly as she ran up on to the deck what's the use of telling me lies in her anger that a woman of fifty should behave like a child and come cringing to a girl because she wanted to sit where she had not leave to sit she did not think of the particular case and unpacking her music soon forgot all about the old woman and her sheets mrs chailey folded her sheets but her expression testified to flatness within the world no longer cared about her and a ship was not a home when the lamps were lit yesterday and the sailors went tumbling above her head she had cried she would cry this evening she would cry to morrow it was not home meanwhile she arranged her ornaments in the room which she had won too easily they were strange ornaments to bring on a sea voyage china pugs tea sets in miniature cups stamped floridly with the arms of the city of bristol hair pin boxes crusted with shamrock antelopes heads in coloured plaster together with a multitude of tiny photographs representing downright workmen in their sunday best and women holding white babies but there was one portrait in a gilt frame for which a nail was needed and before she sought it mrs chailey put on her spectacles and read what was written on a slip of paper at the back this picture of her mistress is given to emma chailey by willoughby vinrace in gratitude for thirty years of devoted service tears obliterated the words and the head of the nail so long as i can do something for your family she was saying as she hammered at it when a voice called melodiously in the passage mrs chailey mrs chailey chailey instantly tidied her dress composed her face and opened the door i'm in a fix said mrs ambrose who was flushed and out of breath you know what gentlemen are the chairs too high the tables too low there's six inches between the floor and the door what i want's a hammer an old quilt and have you such a thing as a kitchen table anyhow between us she now flung open the door of her husband's sitting room and revealed ridley pacing up and down his forehead all wrinkled and the collar of his coat turned up it's as though they'd taken pains to torment me he cried stopping dead did i come on this voyage in order to catch rheumatism and pneumonia really one might have credited vinrace with more sense my dear helen was on her knees under a table you are only making yourself untidy and we had much better recognise the fact that we are condemned to six weeks of unspeakable misery to come at all was the height of folly but now that we are here i suppose that i can face it like a man my diseases of course will be increased i feel already worse than i did yesterday but we've only ourselves to thank and the children happily move move move cried helen chasing him from corner to corner with a chair as though he were an errant hen out of the way ridley and in half an hour you'll find it ready she turned him out of the room and they could hear him groaning and swearing as he went along the passage i daresay he isn't very strong said mrs chailey looking at mrs ambrose compassionately as she helped to shift and carry it's books sighed helen lifting an armful of sad volumes from the floor to the shelf greek from morning to night if ever miss rachel marries chailey pray that she may marry a man who doesn't know his abc the preliminary discomforts and harshnesses which generally make the first days of a sea voyage so cheerless and trying to the temper being somehow lived through the succeeding days passed pleasantly enough october was well advanced but steadily burning with a warmth that made the early months of the summer appear very young and capricious great tracts of the earth lay now beneath the autumn sun and the whole of england from the bald moors to the cornish rocks was lit up from dawn to sunset and showed in stretches of yellow green and purple under that illumination even the roofs of the great towns glittered in thousands of small gardens millions of dark red flowers were blooming until the old ladies who had tended them so carefully came down the paths with their scissors snipped through their juicy stalks and laid them upon cold stone ledges in the village church innumerable parties of picnickers coming home at sunset cried was there ever such a day as this it's you the young men whispered oh it's you the young women replied all old people and many sick people were drawn were it only for a foot or two into the open air and prognosticated pleasant things about the course of the world as for the confidences and expressions of love that were heard not only in cornfields but in lamplit rooms where the windows opened on the garden and men with cigars kissed women with grey hairs they were not to be counted some said that the sky was an emblem of the life to come long tailed birds clattered and screamed and crossed from wood to wood with golden eyes in their plumage but while all this went on by land very few people thought about the sea they took it for granted that the sea was calm and there was no need as there is in many houses when the creeper taps on the bedroom windows for the couples to murmur before they kiss think of the ships to night or thank heaven i'm not the man in the lighthouse for all they imagined the ships when they vanished on the sky line dissolved like snow in water the grown up view indeed was not much clearer than the view of the little creatures in bathing drawers who were trotting in to the foam all along the coasts of england and scooping up buckets full of water they saw white sails or tufts of smoke pass across the horizon and if you had said that these were waterspouts or the petals of white sea flowers they would have agreed the people in ships however took an equally singular view of england not only did it appear to them to be an island and a very small island but it was a shrinking island in which people were imprisoned one figured them first swarming about like aimless ants and almost pressing each other over the edge and then as the ship withdrew one figured them making a vain clamour which being unheard either ceased or rose into a brawl finally when the ship was out of sight of land it became plain that the people of england were completely mute the disease attacked other parts of the earth europe shrank asia shrank africa and america shrank until it seemed doubtful whether the ship would ever run against any of those wrinkled little rocks again but on the other hand an immense dignity had descended upon her she was an inhabitant of the great world which has so few inhabitants travelling all day across an empty universe with veils drawn before her and behind she was more lonely than the caravan crossing the desert she was infinitely more mysterious moving by her own power and sustained by her own resources the sea might give her death or some unexampled joy and none would know of it she was a bride going forth to her husband a virgin unknown of men in her vigor and purity she might be likened to all beautiful things for as a ship she had a life of her own indeed if they had not been blessed in their weather one blue day being bowled up after another smooth round and flawless mrs ambrose would have found it very dull as it was she had her embroidery frame set up on deck with a little table by her side on which lay open a black volume of philosophy she chose a thread from the vari coloured tangle that lay in her lap and sewed red into the bark of a tree or yellow into the river torrent she was working at a great design of a tropical river running through a tropical forest where spotted deer would eventually browse upon masses of fruit bananas oranges and giant pomegranates while a troop of naked natives whirled darts into the air between the stitches she looked to one side and read a sentence about the reality of matter or the nature of good round her men in blue jerseys knelt and scrubbed the boards or leant over the rails and whistled and not far off mr pepper sat cutting up roots with a penknife the rest were occupied in other parts of the ship ridley at his greek he had never found quarters more to his liking willoughby at his documents for he used a voyage to work of arrears of business and rachel helen between her sentences of philosophy wondered sometimes what rachel _did_ do with herself she meant vaguely to go and see they had scarcely spoken two words to each other since that first evening they were polite when they met but there had been no confidence of any kind rachel seemed to get on very well with her father much better helen thought than she ought to and was as ready to let helen alone as helen was to let her alone at that moment rachel was sitting in her room doing absolutely nothing when the ship was full this apartment bore some magnificent title and was the resort of elderly sea sick ladies who left the deck to their youngsters by virtue of the piano and a mess of books on the floor rachel considered it her room and there she would sit for hours playing very difficult music reading a little german or a little english when the mood took her and doing as at this moment absolutely nothing the way she had been educated joined to a fine natural indolence was of course partly the reason of it for she had been educated as the majority of well to do girls in the last part of the nineteenth century were educated kindly doctors and gentle old professors had taught her the rudiments of about ten different branches of knowledge but they would as soon have forced her to go through one piece of drudgery thoroughly as they would have told her that her hands were dirty the one hour or the two hours weekly passed very pleasantly partly owing to the other pupils partly to the fact that the window looked upon the back of a shop where figures appeared against the red windows in winter partly to the accidents that are bound to happen when more than two people are in the same room together but there was no subject in the world which she knew accurately her mind was in the state of an intelligent man's in the beginning of the reign of queen elizabeth she would believe practically anything she was told invent reasons for anything she said the shape of the earth the history of the world how trains worked or money was invested what laws were in force which people wanted what and why they wanted it the most elementary idea of a system in modern life none of this had been imparted to her by any of her professors or mistresses but this system of education had one great advantage it did not teach anything but it put no obstacle in the way of any real talent that the pupil might chance to have rachel being musical was allowed to learn nothing but music she became a fanatic about music all the energies that might have gone into languages science or literature that might have made her friends or shown her the world poured straight into music finding her teachers inadequate she had practically taught herself at the age of twenty four she knew as much about music as most people do when they are thirty and could play as well as nature allowed her to which as became daily more obvious was a really generous allowance if this one definite gift was surrounded by dreams and ideas of the most extravagant and foolish description no one was any the wiser her education being thus ordinary her circumstances were no more out of the common she was an only child and had never been bullied and laughed at by brothers and sisters her mother having died when she was eleven two aunts the sisters of her father brought her up and they lived for the sake of the air in a comfortable house in richmond she was of course brought up with excessive care which as a child was for her health as a girl and a young woman was for what it seems almost crude to call her morals until quite lately she had been completely ignorant that for women such things existed she groped for knowledge in old books and found it in repulsive chunks but she did not naturally care for books and thus never troubled her head about the censorship which was exercised first by her aunts later by her father friends might have told her things but she had few of her own age richmond being an awkward place to reach and as it happened the only girl she knew well was a religious zealot who in the fervour of intimacy talked about god and the best ways of taking up one's cross a topic only fitfully interesting to one whose mind reached other stages at other times but lying in her chair with one hand behind her head the other grasping the knob on the arm she was clearly following her thoughts intently her education left her abundant time for thinking her eyes were fixed so steadily upon a ball on the rail of the ship that she would have been startled and annoyed if anything had chanced to obscure it for a second she had begun her meditations with a shout of laughter caused by the following translation from _tristan_ in shrinking trepidation his shame he seems to hide while to the king his relation he brings the corpse like bride seems it so senseless what i say she cried that it did and threw down the book next she had picked up _cowper's_ _letters_ the classic prescribed by her father which had bored her so that one sentence chancing to say something about the smell of broom in his garden she had thereupon seen the little hall at richmond laden with flowers on the day of her mother's funeral smelling so strong that now any flower scent brought back the sickly horrible sensation and so from one scene she passed half hearing half seeing to another she saw her aunt lucy arranging flowers in the drawing room aunt lucy she volunteered i don't like the smell of broom it reminds me of funerals nonsense rachel aunt lucy replied don't say such foolish things dear i always think it a particularly cheerful plant lying in the hot sun her mind was fixed upon the characters of her aunts their views and the way they lived indeed this was a subject that lasted her hundreds of morning walks round richmond park and blotted out the trees and the people and the deer why did they do the things they did and what did they feel and what was it all about again she heard aunt lucy talking to aunt eleanor she had been that morning to take up the character of a servant and of course at half past ten in the"
