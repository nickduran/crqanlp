"1" "be told him of a people wild and extravagant enough to be attached to scenery so extraordinary but the same worthy person when placed in his own snug parlour and surrounded by all the comforts of an englishman's fireside is not half so much disposed to believe that his own ancestors led a very different life from himself that the shattered tower which now forms a vista from his window once held a baron who would have hung him up at his own door without any form of trial that the hinds by whom his little pet farm is managed a few centuries ago would have been his slaves and that the complete influence of feudal tyranny once extended over the neighbouring village where the attorney is now a man of more importance than the lord of the manor while i own the force of these objections i must confess at the same time that they do not appear to me to be altogether insurmountable the scantiness of materials is indeed a formidable difficulty but no one knows better than dr dryasdust that to those deeply read in antiquity hints concerning the private life of our ancestors lie scattered through the pages of our various historians bearing indeed a slender proportion to the other matters of which they treat but still when collected together sufficient to throw considerable light upon the vie prive of our forefathers indeed i am convinced that however i myself may fail in the ensuing attempt yet with more labour in collecting or more skill in using the materials within his reach illustrated as they have been by the labours of dr henry of the late mr strutt and above all of mr sharon turner an abler hand would have been successful and therefore i protest beforehand against any argument which may be founded on the failure of the present experiment on the other hand i have already said that if any thing like a true picture of old english manners could be drawn i would trust to the good nature and good sense of my countrymen for insuring its favourable reception having thus replied to the best of my power to the first class of your objections or at least having shown my resolution to overleap the barriers which your prudence has raised i will be brief in noticing that which is more peculiar to myself it seems to be your opinion that the very office of an antiquary employed in grave and as the vulgar will sometimes allege in toilsome and minute research must be considered as incapacitating him from successfully compounding a tale of this sort but permit me to say my dear doctor that this objection is rather formal than substantial it is true that such slight compositions might not suit the severer genius of our friend mr oldbuck yet horace walpole wrote a goblin tale which has thrilled through many a bosom and george ellis could transfer all the playful fascination of a humour as delightful as it was uncommon into his abridgement of the ancient metrical romances so that however i may have occasion to rue my present audacity i have at least the most respectable precedents in my favour still the severer antiquary may think that by thus intermingling fiction with truth i am polluting the well of history with modern inventions and impressing upon the rising generation false ideas of the age which i describe i cannot but in some sense admit the force of this reasoning which i yet hope to traverse by the following considerations it is true that i neither can nor do pretend to the observation of complete accuracy even in matters of outward costume much less in the more important points of language and manners but the same motive which prevents my writing the dialogue of the piece in anglo saxon or in norman french and which prohibits my sending forth to the public this essay printed with the types of caxton or wynken de worde prevents my attempting to confine myself within the limits of the period in which my story is laid it is necessary for exciting interest of any kind that the subject assumed should be as it were translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in no fascination has ever been attached to oriental literature equal to that produced by mr galland's first translation of the arabian tales in which retaining on the one hand the splendour of eastern costume and on the other the wildness of eastern fiction he mixed these with just so much ordinary feeling and expression as rendered them interesting and intelligible while he abridged the long winded narratives curtailed the monotonous reflections and rejected the endless repetitions of the arabian original the tales therefore though less purely oriental than in their first concoction were eminently better fitted for the european market and obtained an unrivalled degree of public favour which they certainly would never have gained had not the manners and style been in some degree familiarized to the feelings and habits of the western reader in point of justice therefore to the multitudes who will i trust devour this book with avidity i have so far explained our ancient manners in modern language and so far detailed the characters and sentiments of my persons that the modern reader will not find himself i should hope much trammelled by the repulsive dryness of mere antiquity in this i respectfully contend i have in no respect exceeded the fair license due to the author of a fictitious composition the late ingenious mr strutt in his romance of queen hoo hall 5 acted upon another principle and in distinguishing between what was ancient and modern forgot as it appears to me that extensive neutral ground the large proportion that is of manners and sentiments which are common to us and to our ancestors having been handed down unaltered from them to us or which arising out of the principles of our common nature must have existed alike in either state of society in this manner a man of talent and of great antiquarian erudition limited the popularity of his work by excluding from it every thing which was not sufficiently obsolete to be altogether forgotten and unintelligible the license which i would here vindicate is so necessary to the execution of my plan that i will crave your patience while i illustrate my argument a little farther he who first opens chaucer or any other ancient poet is so much struck with the obsolete spelling multiplied consonants and antiquated appearance of the language that he is apt to lay the work down in despair as encrusted too deep with the rust of antiquity to permit his judging of its merits or tasting its beauties but if some intelligent and accomplished friend points out to him that the difficulties by which he is startled are more in appearance than reality if by reading aloud to him or by reducing the ordinary words to the modern orthography he satisfies his proselyte that only about one tenth part of the words employed are in fact obsolete the novice may be easily persuaded to approach the well of english undefiled with the certainty that a slender degree of patience will enable him to to enjoy both the humour and the pathos with which old geoffrey delighted the age of cressy and of poictiers to pursue this a little farther if our neophyte strong in the new born love of antiquity were to undertake to imitate what he had learnt to admire it must be allowed he would act very injudiciously if he were to select from the glossary the obsolete words which it contains and employ those exclusively of all phrases and vocables retained in modern days this was the error of the unfortunate chatterton in order to give his language the appearance of antiquity he rejected every word that was modern and produced a dialect entirely different from any that had ever been spoken in great britain he who would imitate an ancient language with success must attend rather to its grammatical character turn of expression and mode of arrangement than labour to collect extraordinary and antiquated terms which as i have already averred do not in ancient authors approach the number of words still in use though perhaps somewhat altered in sense and spelling in the proportion of one to ten what i have applied to language is still more justly applicable to sentiments and manners the passions the sources from which these must spring in all their modifications are generally the same in all ranks and conditions all countries and ages and it follows as a matter of course that the opinions habits of thinking and actions however influenced by the peculiar state of society must still upon the whole bear a strong resemblance to each other our ancestors were not more distinct from us surely than jews are from christians they had eyes hands organs dimensions senses affections passions were fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as ourselves the tenor therefore of their affections and feelings must have borne the same general proportion to our own it follows therefore that of the materials which an author has to use in a romance or fictitious composition such as i have ventured to attempt he will find that a great proportion both of language and manners is as proper to the present time as to those in which he has laid his time of action the freedom of choice which this allows him is therefore much greater and the difficulty of his task much more diminished than at first appears to take an illustration from a sister art the antiquarian details may be said to represent the peculiar features of a landscape under delineation of the pencil his feudal tower must arise in due majesty the figures which he introduces must have the costume and character of their age the piece must represent the peculiar features of the scene which he has chosen for his subject with all its appropriate elevation of rock or precipitate descent of cataract his general colouring too must be copied from nature the sky must be clouded or serene according to the climate and the general tints must be those which prevail in a natural landscape so far the painter is bound down by the rules of his art to a precise imitation of the features of nature but it is not required that he should descend to copy all her more minute features or represent with absolute exactness the very herbs flowers and trees with which the spot is decorated these as well as all the more minute points of light and shadow are attributes proper to scenery in general natural to each situation and subject to the artist's disposal as his taste or pleasure may dictate it is true that this license is confined in either case within legitimate bounds the painter must introduce no ornament inconsistent with the climate or country of his landscape he must not plant cypress trees upon inch merrin or scottish firs among the ruins of persepolis and the author lies under a corresponding restraint however far he may venture in a more full detail of passions and feelings than is to be found in the ancient compositions which he imitates he must introduce nothing inconsistent with the manners of the age his knights squires grooms and yeomen may be more fully drawn than in the hard dry delineations of an ancient illuminated manuscript but the character and costume of the age must remain inviolate they must be the same figures drawn by a better pencil or to speak more modestly executed in an age when the principles of art were better understood his language must not be exclusively obsolete and unintelligible but he should admit if possible no word or turn of phraseology betraying an origin directly modern it is one thing to make use of the language and sentiments which are common to ourselves and our forefathers and it is another to invest them with the sentiments and dialect exclusively proper to their descendants this my dear friend i have found the most difficult part of my task and to speak frankly i hardly expect to satisfy your less partial judgment and more extensive knowledge of such subjects since i have hardly been able to please my own i am conscious that i shall be found still more faulty in the tone of keeping and costume by those who may be disposed rigidly to examine my tale with reference to the manners of the exact period in which my actors flourished it may be that i have introduced little which can positively be termed modern but on the other hand it is extremely probable that i may have confused the manners of two or three centuries and introduced during the reign of richard the first circumstances appropriated to a period either considerably earlier or a good deal later than that era it is my comfort that errors of this kind will escape the general class of readers and that i may share in the ill deserved applause of those architects who in their modern gothic do not hesitate to introduce without rule or method ornaments proper to different styles and to different periods of the art those whose extensive researches have given them the means of judging my backslidings with more severity will probably be lenient in proportion to their knowledge of the difficulty of my task my honest and neglected friend ingulphus has furnished me with many a valuable hint but the light afforded by the monk of croydon and geoffrey de vinsauff is dimmed by such a conglomeration of uninteresting and unintelligible matter that we gladly fly for relief to the delightful pages of the gallant froissart although he flourished at a period so much more remote from the date of my history if therefore my dear friend you have generosity enough to pardon the presumptuous attempt to frame for myself a minstrel coronet partly out of the pearls of pure antiquity and partly from the bristol stones and paste with which i have endeavoured to imitate them i am convinced your opinion of the difficulty of the task will reconcile you to the imperfect manner of its execution of my materials i have but little to say they may be chiefly found in the singular anglo norman ms which sir arthur wardour preserves with such jealous care in the third drawer of his oaken cabinet scarcely allowing any one to touch it and being himself not able to read one syllable of its contents i should never have got his consent on my visit to scotland to read in those precious pages for so many hours had i not promised to designate it by some emphatic mode of printing as the wardour manuscript giving it thereby an individuality as important as the bannatyne ms the auchinleck ms and any other monument of the patience of a gothic scrivener i have sent for your private consideration a list of the contents of this curious piece which i shall perhaps subjoin with your approbation to the third volume of my tale in case the printer's devil should continue impatient for copy when the whole of my narrative has been imposed adieu my dear friend i have said enough to explain if not to vindicate the attempt which i have made and which in spite of your doubts and my own incapacity i am still willing to believe has not been altogether made in vain i hope you are now well recovered from your spring fit of the gout and shall be happy if the advice of your learned physician should recommend a tour to these parts several curiosities have been lately dug up near the wall as well as at the ancient station of habitancum talking of the latter i suppose you have long since heard the news that a sulky churlish boor has destroyed the ancient statue or rather bas relief popularly called robin of redesdale it seems robin's fame attracted more visitants than was consistent with the growth of the heather upon a moor worth a shilling an acre reverend as you write yourself be revengeful for once and pray with me that he may be visited with such a fit of the stone as if he had all the fragments of poor robin in that region of his viscera where the disease holds its seat tell this not in gath lest the scots rejoice that they have at length found a parallel instance among their neighbours to that barbarous deed which demolished arthur's oven but there is no end to lamentation when we betake ourselves to such subjects my respectful compliments attend miss dryasdust i endeavoured to match the spectacles agreeable to her commission during my late journey to london and hope she has received them safe and found them satisfactory i send this by the blind carrier so that probably it may be some time upon its journey 6 the last news which i hear from edinburgh is that the gentleman who fills the situation of secretary to the society of antiquaries of scotland 7 is the best amateur draftsman in that kingdom and that much is expected from his skill and zeal in delineating those specimens of national antiquity which are either mouldering under the slow touch of time or swept away by modern taste with the same besom of destruction which john knox used at the reformation once more adieu vale tandem non immemor mei believe me to be reverend and very dear sir your most faithful humble servant laurence templeton toppingwold near egremont cumberland nov 17 1817 ivanhoe chapter i thus communed these while to their lowly dome the full fed swine return'd with evening home compell'd reluctant to the several sties with din obstreperous and ungrateful cries pope's odyssey in that pleasant district of merry england which is watered by the river don there extended in ancient times a large forest covering the greater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between sheffield and the pleasant town of doncaster the remains of this extensive wood are still to be seen at the noble seats of wentworth of warncliffe park and around rotherham here haunted of yore the fabulous dragon of wantley here were fought many of the most desperate battles during the civil wars of the roses and here also flourished in ancient times those bands of gallant outlaws whose deeds have been rendered so popular in english song such being our chief scene the date of our story refers to a period towards the end of the reign of richard i when his return from his long captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his despairing subjects who were in the meantime subjected to every species of subordinate oppression the nobles whose power had become exorbitant during the reign of stephen and whom the prudence of henry the second had scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown had now resumed their ancient license in its utmost extent despising the feeble interference of the english council of state fortifying their castles increasing the number of their dependants reducing all around them to a state of vassalage and striving by every means in their power to place themselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him to make a figure in the national convulsions which appeared to be impending the situation of the inferior gentry or franklins as they were called who by the law and spirit of the english constitution were entitled to hold themselves independent of feudal tyranny became now unusually precarious if as was most generally the case they placed themselves under the protection of any of the petty kings in their vicinity accepted of feudal offices in his household or bound themselves by mutual treaties of alliance and protection to support him in his enterprises they might indeed purchase temporary repose but it must be with the sacrifice of that independence which was so dear to every english bosom and at the certain hazard of being involved as a party in whatever rash expedition the ambition of their protector might lead him to undertake on the other hand such and so multiplied were the means of vexation and oppression possessed by the great barons that they never wanted the pretext and seldom the will to harass and pursue even to the very edge of destruction any of their less powerful neighbours who attempted to separate themselves from their authority and to trust for their protection during the dangers of the times to their own inoffensive conduct and to the laws of the land a circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the nobility and the sufferings of the inferior classes arose from the consequences of the conquest by duke william of normandy four generations had not sufficed to blend the hostile blood of the normans and anglo saxons or to unite by common language and mutual interests two hostile races one of which still felt the elation of triumph while the other groaned under all the consequences of defeat the power had been completely placed in the hands of the norman nobility by the event of the battle of hastings and it had been used as our histories assure us with no moderate hand the whole race of saxon princes and nobles had been extirpated or disinherited with few or no exceptions nor were the numbers great who possessed land in the country of their fathers even as proprietors of the second or of yet inferior classes the royal policy had long been to weaken by every means legal or illegal the strength of a part of the population which was justly considered as nourishing the most inveterate antipathy to their victor all the monarchs of the norman race had shown the most marked predilection for their norman subjects the laws of the chase and many others equally unknown to the milder and more free spirit of the saxon constitution had been fixed upon the necks of the subjugated inhabitants to add weight as it were to the feudal chains with which they were loaded at court and in the castles of the great nobles where the pomp and state of a court was emulated norman french was the only language employed in courts of law the pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same tongue in short french was the language of honour of chivalry and even of justice while the far more manly and expressive anglo saxon was abandoned to the use of rustics and hinds who knew no other still however the necessary intercourse between the lords of the soil and those oppressed inferior beings by whom that soil was cultivated occasioned the gradual formation of a dialect compounded betwixt the french and the anglo saxon in which they could render themselves mutually intelligible to each other and from this necessity arose by degrees the structure of our present english language in which the speech of the victors and the vanquished have been so happily blended together and which has since been so richly improved by importations from the classical languages and from those spoken by the southern nations of europe this state of things i have thought it necessary to premise for the information of the general reader who might be apt to forget that although no great historical events such as war or insurrection mark the existence of the anglo saxons as a separate people subsequent to the reign of william the second yet the great national distinctions betwixt them and their conquerors the recollection of what they had formerly been and to what they were now reduced continued down to the reign of edward the third to keep open the wounds which the conquest had inflicted and to maintain a line of separation betwixt the descendants of the victor normans and the vanquished saxons the sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest which we have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter hundreds of broad headed short stemmed wide branched oaks which had witnessed perhaps the stately march of the roman soldiery flung their gnarled arms over a thick carpet of the most delicious green sward in some places they were intermingled with beeches hollies and copsewood of various descriptions so closely as totally to intercept the level beams of the sinking sun in others they receded from each other forming those long sweeping vistas in the intricacy of which the eye delights to lose itself while imagination considers them as the paths to yet wilder scenes of silvan solitude here the red rays of the sun shot a broken and discoloured light that partially hung upon the shattered boughs and mossy trunks of the trees and there they illuminated in brilliant patches the portions of turf to which they made their way a considerable open space in the midst of this glade seemed formerly to have been dedicated to the rites of druidical superstition for on the summit of a hillock so regular as to seem artificial there still remained part of a circle of rough unhewn stones of large dimensions seven stood upright the rest had been dislodged from their places probably by the zeal of some convert to christianity and lay some prostrate near their former site and others on the side of the hill one large stone only had found its way to the bottom and in stopping the course of a small brook which glided smoothly round the foot of the eminence gave by its opposition a feeble voice of murmur to the placid and elsewhere silent streamlet the human figures which completed this landscape were in number two partaking in their dress and appearance of that wild and rustic character which belonged to the woodlands of the west riding of yorkshire at that early period the eldest of these men had a stern savage and wild aspect his garment was of the simplest form imaginable being a close jacket with sleeves composed of the tanned skin of some animal on which the hair had been originally left but which had been worn off in so many places that it would have been difficult to distinguish from the patches that remained to what creature the fur had belonged this primeval vestment reached from the throat to the knees and served at once all the usual purposes of body clothing there was no wider opening at the collar than was necessary to admit the passage of the head from which it may be inferred that it was put on by slipping it over the head and shoulders in the manner of a modern shirt or ancient hauberk sandals bound with thongs made of boars hide protected the feet and a roll of thin leather was twined artificially round the legs and ascending above the calf left the knees bare like those of a scottish highlander to make the jacket sit yet more close to the body it was gathered at the middle by a broad leathern belt secured by a brass buckle to one side of which was attached a sort of scrip and to the other a ram's horn accoutred with a mouthpiece for the purpose of blowing in the same belt was stuck one of those long broad sharp pointed and two edged knives with a buck's horn handle which were fabricated in the neighbourhood and bore even at this early period the name of a sheffield whittle the man had no covering upon his head which was only defended by his own thick hair matted and twisted together and scorched by the influence of the sun into a rusty dark red colour forming a contrast with the overgrown beard upon his cheeks which was rather of a yellow or amber hue one part of his dress only remains but it is too remarkable to be suppressed it was a brass ring resembling a dog's collar but without any opening and soldered fast round his neck so loose as to form no impediment to his breathing yet so tight as to be incapable of being removed excepting by the use of the file on this singular gorget was engraved in saxon characters an inscription of the following purport gurth the son of beowulph is the born thrall of cedric of rotherwood beside the swine herd for such was gurth's occupation was seated upon one of the fallen druidical monuments a person about ten years younger in appearance and whose dress though resembling his companion's in form was of better materials and of a more fantastic appearance his jacket had been stained of a bright purple hue upon which there had been some attempt to paint grotesque ornaments in different colours to the jacket he added a short cloak which scarcely reached half way down his thigh it was of crimson cloth though a good deal soiled lined with bright yellow and as he could transfer it from one shoulder to the other or at his pleasure draw it all around him its width contrasted with its want of longitude formed a fantastic piece of drapery he had thin silver bracelets upon his arms and on his neck a collar of the same metal bearing the inscription wamba the son of witless is the thrall of cedric of rotherwood this personage had the same sort of sandals with his companion but instead of the roll of leather"
