"1" "selfish sisters is an underdog at twenty seven jo had been the dutiful hard working son in the wholesale harness business of a widowed and gummidging mother who called him joey now and then a double wrinkle would appear between jo's eyes a wrinkle that had no business there at twenty seven then jo's mother died leaving him handicapped by a deathbed promise the three sisters and a three story and basement house on calumet avenue jo's wrinkle became a fixture joey his mother had said in her high thin voice take care of the girls i will ma jo had choked joey and the voice was weaker promise me you won't marry till the girls are all provided for then as jo had hesitated appalled joey it's my dying wish promise i promise ma he had said whereupon his mother had died comfortably leaving him with a completely ruined life they were not bad looking girls and they had a certain style too that is stell and eva had carrie the middle one taught school over on the west side in those days it took her almost two hours each way she said the kind of costume she required should have been corrugated steel but all three knew what was being worn and they wore it or fairly faithful copies of it eva the housekeeping sister had a needle knack she could skim the state street windows and come away with a mental photograph of every separate tuck hem yoke and ribbon heads of departments showed her the things they kept in drawers and she went home and reproduced them with the aid of a seamstress by the day stell the youngest was the beauty they called her babe twenty three years ago one's sisters did not strain at the household leash nor crave a career carrie taught school and hated it eva kept house expertly and complainingly babe's profession was being the family beauty and it took all her spare time eva always let her sleep until ten this was jo's household and he was the nominal head of it but it was an empty title the three women dominated his life they weren't consciously selfish if you had called them cruel they would have put you down as mad when you are the lone brother of three sisters it means that you must constantly be calling for escorting or dropping one of them somewhere most men of jo's age were standing before their mirror of a saturday night whistling blithely and abstractedly while they discarded a blue polka dot for a maroon tie whipped off the maroon for a shot silk and at the last moment decided against the shot silk in favor of a plain black and white because she had once said she preferred quiet ties jo when he should have been preening his feathers for conquest was saying well my god i am hurrying give a man time can't you i just got home you girls been laying around the house all day no wonder you're ready he took a certain pride in seeing his sisters well dressed at a time when he should have been reveling in fancy waistcoats and brilliant hued socks according to the style of that day and the inalienable right of any unwed male under thirty in any day on those rare occasions when his business necessitated an out of town trip he would spend half a day floundering about the shops selecting handkerchiefs or stockings or feathers or gloves for the girls they always turned out to be the wrong kind judging by their reception from carrie what in the world do i want of long white gloves i thought you didn't have any jo would say i haven't i never wear evening clothes jo would pass a futile hand over the top of his head as was his way when disturbed i just thought you'd like them i thought every girl liked long white gloves just feebly just to to have oh for pity's sake and from eva or babe i've got silk stockings jo or you brought me handkerchiefs the last time there was something selfish in his giving as there always is in any gift freely and joyfully made they never suspected the exquisite pleasure it gave him to select these things these fine soft silken things there were many things about this slow going amiable brother of theirs that they never suspected if you had told them he was a dreamer of dreams for example they would have been amused sometimes dead tired by nine o'clock after a hard day downtown he would doze over the evening paper at intervals he would wake red eyed to a snatch of conversation such as yes but if you get a blue you can wear it anywhere it's dressy and at the same time it's quiet too eva the expert wrestling with carrie over the problem of the new spring dress they never guessed that the commonplace man in the frayed old smoking jacket had banished them all from the room long ago had banished himself for that matter in his place was a tall debonair and rather dangerously handsome man to whom six o'clock spelled evening clothes the kind of man who can lean up against a mantel or propose a toast or give an order to a manservant or whisper a gallant speech in a lady's ear with equal ease the shabby old house on calumet avenue was transformed into a brocaded and chandeliered rendezvous for the brilliance of the city beauty was here and wit but none so beautiful and witty as she mrs er jo hertz there was wine of course but no vulgar display there was music the soft sheen of satin laughter and he the gracious tactful host king of his own domain jo for heaven's sake if you're going to snore go to bed why did i fall asleep you haven't been doing anything else all evening a person would think you were fifty instead of thirty and jo hertz was again just the dull gray commonplace brother of three well meaning sisters babe used to say petulantly jo why don't you ever bring home any of your men friends a girl might as well not have any brother all the good you do jo conscience stricken did his best to make amends but a man who has been petticoat ridden for years loses the knack somehow of comradeship with men one sunday in may jo came home from a late sunday afternoon walk to find company for supper carrie often had in one of her schoolteacher friends or babe one of her frivolous intimates or even eva a staid guest of the old girl type there was always a sunday night supper of potato salad and cold meat and coffee and perhaps a fresh cake jo rather enjoyed it being a hospitable soul but he regarded the guests with the undazzled eyes of a man to whom they were just so many petticoats timid of the night streets and requiring escort home if you had suggested to him that some of his sisters popularity was due to his own presence or if you had hinted that the more kittenish of these visitors were probably making eyes at him he would have stared in amazement and unbelief this sunday night it turned out to be one of carrie's friends emily said carrie this is my brother jo jo had learned what to expect in carrie's friends drab looking women in the late thirties whose facial lines all slanted downward happy to meet you said jo and looked down at a different sort altogether a most surprisingly different sort for one of carrie's friends this emily person was very small and fluffy and blue eyed and crinkly looking the corners of her mouth when she smiled and her eyes when she looked up at you and her hair which was brown but had the miraculous effect somehow of looking golden jo shook hands with her her hand was incredibly small and soft so that you were afraid of crushing it until you discovered she had a firm little grip all her own it surprised and amused you that grip as does a baby's unexpected clutch on your patronizing forefinger as jo felt it in his own big clasp the strangest thing happened to him something inside jo hertz stopped working for a moment then lurched sickeningly then thumped like mad it was his heart he stood staring down at her and she up at him until the others laughed then their hands fell apart lingeringly are you a schoolteacher emily he said kindergarten it's my first year and don't call me emily please why not it's your name i think it's the prettiest name in the world which he hadn't meant to say at all in fact he was perfectly aghast to find himself saying it but he meant it at supper he passed her things and stared until everybody laughed again and eva said acidly why don't you feed her it wasn't that emily had an air of helplessness she just made him feel he wanted her to be helpless so that he could help her jo took her home and from that sunday night he began to strain at the leash he took his sisters out dutifully but he would suggest with a carelessness that deceived no one don't you want one of your girl friends to come along that little what's her name emily or something so long's i've got three of you i might as well have a full squad for a long time he didn't know what was the matter with him he only knew he was miserable and yet happy sometimes his heart seemed to ache with an actual physical ache he realized that he wanted to do things for emily he wanted to buy things for emily useless pretty expensive things that he couldn't afford he wanted to buy everything that emily needed and everything that emily desired he wanted to marry emily that was it he discovered that one day with a shock in the midst of a transaction in the harness business he stared at the man with whom he was dealing until that startled person grew uncomfortable what's the matter hertz matter you look as if you'd seen a ghost or found a gold mine i don't know which gold mine said jo and then no ghost for he remembered that high thin voice and his promise and the harness business was slithering downhill with dreadful rapidity as the automobile business began its amazing climb jo tried to stop it but he was not that kind of businessman it never occurred to him to jump out of the down going vehicle and catch the up going one he stayed on vainly applying brakes that refused to work you know emily i couldn't support two households now not the way things are but if you'll wait if you'll only wait the girls might that is babe and carrie she was a sensible little thing emily of course i'll wait but we mustn't just sit back and let the years go by we've got to help she went about it as if she were already a little matchmaking matron she corralled all the men she had ever known and introduced them to babe carrie and eva separately in pairs and en masse she got up picnics she stayed home while jo took the three about when she was present she tried to look as plain and obscure as possible so that the sisters should show up to advantage she schemed and planned and contrived and hoped and smiled into jo's despairing eyes and three years went by three precious years carrie still taught school and hated it eva kept house more and more complainingly as prices advanced and allowance retreated stell was still babe the family beauty emily's hair somehow lost its glint and began to look just plain brown her crinkliness began to iron out now look here jo argued desperately one night we could be happy anyway there's plenty of room at the house lots of people begin that way of course i couldn't give you all i'd like to at first but maybe after a while no dreams of salons and brocade and velvet footed servitors and satin damask now just two rooms all their own all alone and emily to work for that was his dream but it seemed less possible than that other absurd one had been emily was as practical a little thing as she looked fluffy she knew women especially did she know eva and carrie and babe she tried to imagine herself taking the household affairs and the housekeeping pocket book out of eva's expert hands so then she tried to picture herself allowing the reins of jo's house to remain in eva's hands and everything feminine and normal in her rebelled emily knew she'd want to put away her own freshly laundered linen and smooth it and pat it she was that kind of woman she knew she'd want to do her own delightful haggling with butcher and grocer she knew she'd want to muss jo's hair and sit on his knee and even quarrel with him if necessary without the awareness of three ever present pairs of maiden eyes and ears no no we'd only be miserable i know even if they didn't object and they would jo wouldn't they his silence was miserable assent then but you do love me don't you emily i do jo i love you and love you and love you but jo i can't i know it dear i knew it all the time really i just thought maybe somehow the two sat staring for a moment into space their hands clasped then they both shut their eyes with a little shudder as though what they saw was terrible to look upon emily's hand the tiny hand that was so unexpectedly firm tightened its hold on his and his crushed the absurd fingers until she winced with pain that was the beginning of the end and they knew it emily wasn't the kind of girl who would be left to pine there are too many jos in the world whose hearts are prone to lurch and then thump at the feel of a soft fluttering incredibly small hand in their grip one year later emily was married to a young man whose father owned a large pie shaped slice of the prosperous state of michigan that being safely accomplished there was something grimly humorous in the trend taken by affairs in the old house on calumet for eva married married well too though he was a great deal older than she she went off in a hat she had copied from a french model at field's and a suit she had contrived with a home dressmaker aided by pressing on the part of the little tailor in the basement over on thirty first street it was the last of that though the next time they saw her she had on a hat that even she would have despaired of copying and a suit that sort of melted into your gaze she moved to the north side trust eva for that and babe assumed the management of the household on calumet avenue it was rather a pinched little household now for the harness business shrank and shrank i don't see how you can expect me to keep house decently on this babe would say contemptuously babe's nose always a little inclined to sharpness had whittled down to a point of late if you knew what ben gives eva it's the best i can do sis business is something rotten ben says if you had the least bit of ben was eva's husband and quotable as are all successful men i don't care what ben says shouted jo goaded into rage i'm sick of your everlasting ben go and get a ben of your own why don't you if you're so stuck on the way he does things and babe did she made a last desperate drive aided by eva and she captured a rather surprised young man in the brokerage way who had made up his mind not to marry for years and years eva wanted to give her her wedding things but at that jo broke into sudden rebellion no sir no ben is going to buy my sister's wedding clothes understand i guess i'm not broke yet i'll furnish the money for her things and there'll be enough of them too babe had as useless a trousseau and as filled with extravagant pink and blue and lacy and frilly things as any daughter of doting parents jo seemed to find a grim pleasure in providing them but it left him pretty well pinched after babe's marriage she insisted that they call her estelle now jo sold the house on calumet he and carrie took one of those little flats that were springing up seemingly overnight all through chicago's south side there was nothing domestic about carrie she had given up teaching two years before and had gone into social service work on the west side she had what is known as a legal mind hard clear orderly and she made a great success of it her dream was to live at the settlement house and give all her time to the work upon the little household she bestowed a certain amount of grim capable attention it was the same kind of attention she would have given a piece of machinery whose oiling and running had been entrusted to her care she hated it and didn't hesitate to say so jo took to prowling about department store basements and household goods sections he was always sending home a bargain in a ham or a sack of potatoes or fifty pounds of sugar or a window clamp or a new kind of paring knife he was forever doing odd jobs that the janitor should have done it was the domestic in him claiming its own then one night carrie came home with a dull glow in her leathery cheeks and her eyes alight with resolve they had what she called a plain talk listen jo they've offered me the job of first assistant resident worker and i'm going to take it take it i know fifty other girls who'd give their ears for it i go in next month they were at dinner jo looked up from his plate dully then he glanced around the little dining room with its ugly tan walls and its heavy dark furniture the calumet avenue pieces fitted cumbersomely into the five room flat away away from here you mean to live carrie laid down her fork well really jo after all that explanation but to go over there to live why that neighborhood's full of dirt and disease and crime and the lord knows what all i can't let you do that carrie carrie's chin came up she laughed a short little laugh let me that's eighteenth century talk jo my life's my own to live i'm going and she went jo stayed on in the apartment until the lease was up then he sold what furniture he could stored or gave away the rest and took a room on michigan avenue in one of the old stone mansions whose decayed splendor was being put to such purpose jo hertz was his own master free to marry free to come and go and he found he didn't even think of marrying he didn't even want to come or go particularly a rather frumpy old bachelor with thinning hair and a thickening neck every thursday evening he took dinner at eva's and on sunday noon at stell's he tucked his napkin under his chin and openly enjoyed the homemade soup and the well cooked meats after dinner he tried to talk business with eva's husband or stell's his business talks were the old fashioned kind beginning well now looka here take f'rinstance your raw hides and leathers but ben and george didn't want to take f'rinstance your raw hides and leathers they wanted when they took anything at all to take golf or politics or stocks they were the modern type of businessman who prefers to leave his work out of his play business with them was a profession a finely graded and balanced thing differing from jo's clumsy down hill style as completely as does the method of a great criminal detective differ from that of a village constable they would listen restively and say uh uh at intervals and at the first chance they would sort of fade out of the room with a meaning glance at their wives eva had two children now girls they treated uncle jo with good natured tolerance stell had no children uncle jo degenerated by almost imperceptible degrees from the position of honored guest who is served with white meat to that of one who is content with a leg and one of those obscure and bony sections which after much turning with a bewildered and investigating knife and fork leave one baffled and unsatisfied eva and stell got together and decided that jo ought to marry it isn't natural eva told him i never saw a man who took so little interest in women me protested jo almost shyly women yes of course you act like a frightened schoolboy so they had in for dinner certain friends and acquaintances of fitting age they spoke of them as splendid girls between thirty six and forty they talked awfully well in a firm clear way about civics and classes and politics and economics and boards they rather terrified jo he didn't understand much that they talked about and he felt humbly inferior and yet a little resentful as if something had passed him by he escorted them home dutifully though they told him not to bother and they evidently meant it they seemed capable not only of going home quite unattended but of delivering a pointed lecture to any highwayman or brawler who might molest them the following thursday eva would say how did you like her jo like who joe would spar feebly miss matthews who's she now don't be funny jo you know very well i mean the girl who was here for dinner the one who talked so well on the emigration question oh her why i liked her all right seems to be a smart woman smart she's a perfectly splendid girl sure jo would agree cheerfully but didn't you like her i can't say i did eve and i can't say i didn't she made me think a lot of a teacher i had in the fifth reader name of himes as i recall her she must have been a fine woman but i never thought of himes as a woman at all she was just teacher you make me tired snapped eva impatiently a man of your age you don't expect to marry a girl do you a child i don't expect to marry anybody jo had answered and that was the truth lonely though he often was the following spring eva moved to winnetka anyone who got the meaning of the loop knows the significance of a move to a north shore suburb and a house eva's daughter ethel was growing up and her mother had an eye on society that did away with jo's thursday dinners then stell's husband bought a car they went out into the country every sunday stell said it was getting so that maids objected to sunday dinners anyway besides they were unhealthful old fashioned things they always meant to ask jo to come along but by the time their friends were placed and the lunch and the boxes and sweaters and george's camera and everything there seemed to be no room for a man of jo's bulk so that eliminated the sunday dinners just drop in any time during the week stell said for dinner except wednesday that's our bridge night and saturday and of course thursday cook is out that night don't wait for me to phone and so jo drifted into that sad eyed dyspeptic family made up of those you see dining in second rate restaurants their paper propped up against the bowl of oyster crackers munching solemnly and with indifference to the stare of the passer by surveying them through the brazen plate glass window and then came the war the war that spelled death and destruction to millions the war that brought a fortune to jo hertz and transformed him overnight from a baggy kneed old bachelor whose business was a failure to a prosperous manufacturer whose only trouble was the shortage in hides for the making of his product leather the armies of europe called for it harnesses more harnesses straps millions of straps more more the musty old harness business over on lake street was magically changed from a dust covered dead alive concern to an orderly hive that hummed and glittered with success orders poured in jo hertz had inside information on the war he knew about troops and horses he talked with french and english and italian buyers commissioned by their countries to get american made supplies and now when he said to ben or george take f'rinstance your raw hides and leathers they listened with respectful attention and then began the gay dog business in the life of jo hertz he developed into a loop hound ever keen on the scent of fresh pleasure that side of jo hertz which had been repressed and crushed and ignored began to bloom unhealthily at first he spent money on his rather contemptuous nieces he sent them gorgeous furs and watch bracelets and bags he took two expensive rooms at a downtown hotel and there was something more tear compelling than grotesque about the way he gloated over the luxury of a separate ice water tap in the bathroom he explained it just turn it on any hour of the day or night ice water he bought a car naturally a glittering affair in color a bright blue with pale blue leather straps and a great deal of gold fittings and special tires eva said it was the kind of thing a chorus girl would use rather than an elderly businessman you saw him driving about in it red faced and rather awkward at the wheel you saw him too in the pompeian room at the congress hotel of a saturday afternoon when roving eyed matrons in mink coats are wont to congregate to sip pale amber drinks actors grew to recognize the semibald head and the shining round good natured face looming out at them from the dim well of the theater and sometimes in a musical show they directed a quip at him and he liked it he could pick out the critics as they came down the aisle and even had a nodding acquaintance with two of them kelly of the herald he would say carelessly bean of the trib they're all afraid of him so he frolicked ponderously in new york he might have been called a man about town and he was lonesome he was very lonesome so he searched about in his mind and brought from the dim past the memory of the luxuriously furnished establishment of which he used to dream in the evenings when he dozed over his paper in the old house on calumet so he rented an apartment many roomed and expensive with a manservant in charge and furnished it in styles and periods ranging through all the louis the living room was mostly rose color it was like an unhealthy and bloated boudoir and yet there was nothing sybaritic or uncleanly in the sight of this paunchy middle aged man sinking into the rosy cushioned luxury of his ridiculous home it was a frank and naive indulgence of long starved senses and there was in it a great resemblance to the rolling eyed ecstasy of a schoolboy smacking his lips over an all day sucker the war went on and on and on and the money continued to roll in a flood of it then one afternoon eva in town on shopping bent entered a small exclusive and expensive shop on michigan avenue eva's weakness was hats she was seeking a hat now she described what she sought with a languid conciseness and stood looking about her after the saleswoman had vanished in quest of it the room was becomingly rose illumined and somewhat dim so that some minutes had passed before she realized that a man seated on a raspberry brocade settee not five feet away a man with a walking stick and yellow gloves and tan spats and a check suit was her brother jo from him eva's wild eyed glance leaped to the woman who was trying on hats before one of the many long mirrors she was seated and a saleswoman was exclaiming discreetly at her elbow eva turned sharply and encountered her own saleswoman returning hat laden not today she gasped i'm feeling ill suddenly and almost ran from the room that evening she told stell relating her news in that telephone pidgin english devised by every family of married sisters as protection against the neighbors translated it ran thus he looked straight at me my dear i thought i'd die but at least he had sense enough not to speak she was one of those limp willowy creatures with the greediest eyes that she
