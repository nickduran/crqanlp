"1" "afraid now in a new way it was not the fear that he should die passively from lack of food but that he should be destroyed violently before starvation had exhausted the last particle of the endeavor in him that made toward surviving there were the wolves back and forth across the desolation drifted their howls weaving the very air into a fabric of menace that was so tangible that he found himself arms in the air pressing it back from him as it might be the walls of a wind blown tent now and again the wolves in packs of two and three crossed his path but they sheered clear of him they were not in sufficient numbers and besides they were hunting the caribou which did not battle while this strange creature that walked erect might scratch and bite in the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the wolves had made a kill the debris had been a caribou calf an hour before squawking and running and very much alive he contemplated the bones clean picked and polished pink with the cell life in them which had not yet died could it possibly be that he might be that ere the day was done such was life eh a vain and fleeting thing it was only life that pained there was no hurt in death to die was to sleep it meant cessation rest then why was he not content to die but he did not moralize long he was squatting in the moss a bone in his mouth sucking at the shreds of life that still dyed it faintly pink the sweet meaty taste thin and elusive almost as a memory maddened him he closed his jaws on the bones and crunched sometimes it was the bone that broke sometimes his teeth then he crushed the bones between rocks pounded them to a pulp and swallowed them he pounded his fingers too in his haste and yet found a moment in which to feel surprise at the fact that his fingers did not hurt much when caught under the descending rock came frightful days of snow and rain he did not know when he made camp when he broke camp he travelled in the night as much as in the day he rested wherever he fell crawled on whenever the dying life in him flickered up and burned less dimly he as a man no longer strove it was the life in him unwilling to die that drove him on he did not suffer his nerves had become blunted numb while his mind was filled with weird visions and delicious dreams but ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the caribou calf the least remnants of which he had gathered up and carried with him he crossed no more hills or divides but automatically followed a large stream which flowed through a wide and shallow valley he did not see this stream nor this valley he saw nothing save visions soul and body walked or crawled side by side yet apart so slender was the thread that bound them he awoke in his right mind lying on his back on a rocky ledge the sun was shining bright and warm afar off he heard the squawking of caribou calves he was aware of vague memories of rain and wind and snow but whether he had been beaten by the storm for two days or two weeks he did not know for some time he lay without movement the genial sunshine pouring upon him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth a fine day he thought perhaps he could manage to locate himself by a painful effort he rolled over on his side below him flowed a wide and sluggish river its unfamiliarity puzzled him slowly he followed it with his eyes winding in wide sweeps among the bleak bare hills bleaker and barer and lower lying than any hills he had yet encountered slowly deliberately without excitement or more than the most casual interest he followed the course of the strange stream toward the sky line and saw it emptying into a bright and shining sea he was still unexcited most unusual he thought a vision or a mirage more likely a vision a trick of his disordered mind he was confirmed in this by sight of a ship lying at anchor in the midst of the shining sea he closed his eyes for a while then opened them strange how the vision persisted yet not strange he knew there were no seas or ships in the heart of the barren lands just as he had known there was no cartridge in the empty rifle he heard a snuffle behind him a half choking gasp or cough very slowly because of his exceeding weakness and stiffness he rolled over on his other side he could see nothing near at hand but he waited patiently again came the snuffle and cough and outlined between two jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the gray head of a wolf the sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as he had seen them on other wolves the eyes were bleared and bloodshot the head seemed to droop limply and forlornly the animal blinked continually in the sunshine it seemed sick as he looked it snuffled and coughed again this at least was real he thought and turned on the other side so that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled from him before by the vision but the sea still shone in the distance and the ship was plainly discernible was it reality after all he closed his eyes for a long while and thought and then it came to him he had been making north by east away from the dease divide and into the coppermine valley this wide and sluggish river was the coppermine that shining sea was the arctic ocean that ship was a whaler strayed east far east from the mouth of the mackenzie and it was lying at anchor in coronation gulf he remembered the hudson bay company chart he had seen long ago and it was all clear and reasonable to him he sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs he had worn through the blanket wrappings and his feet were shapeless lumps of raw meat his last blanket was gone rifle and knife were both missing he had lost his hat somewhere with the bunch of matches in the band but the matches against his chest were safe and dry inside the tobacco pouch and oil paper he looked at his watch it marked eleven o'clock and was still running evidently he had kept it wound he was calm and collected though extremely weak he had no sensation of pain he was not hungry the thought of food was not even pleasant to him and whatever he did was done by his reason alone he ripped off his pants legs to the knees and bound them about his feet somehow he had succeeded in retaining the tin bucket he would have some hot water before he began what he foresaw was to be a terrible journey to the ship his movements were slow he shook as with a palsy when he started to collect dry moss he found he could not rise to his feet he tried again and again then contented himself with crawling about on hands and knees once he crawled near to the sick wolf the animal dragged itself reluctantly out of his way licking its chops with a tongue which seemed hardly to have the strength to curl the man noticed that the tongue was not the customary healthy red it was a yellowish brown and seemed coated with a rough and half dry mucus after he had drunk a quart of hot water the man found he was able to stand and even to walk as well as a dying man might be supposed to walk every minute or so he was compelled to rest his steps were feeble and uncertain just as the wolf's that trailed him were feeble and uncertain and that night when the shining sea was blotted out by blackness he knew he was nearer to it by no more than four miles throughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf and now and then the squawking of the caribou calves there was life all around him but it was strong life very much alive and well and he knew the sick wolf clung to the sick man's trail in the hope that the man would die first in the morning on opening his eyes he beheld it regarding him with a wistful and hungry stare it stood crouched with tail between its legs like a miserable and woe begone dog it shivered in the chill morning wind and grinned dispiritedly when the man spoke to it in a voice that achieved no more than a hoarse whisper the sun rose brightly and all morning the man tottered and fell toward the ship on the shining sea the weather was perfect it was the brief indian summer of the high latitudes it might last a week to morrow or next day it might he gone in the afternoon the man came upon a trail it was of another man who did not walk but who dragged himself on all fours the man thought it might be bill but he thought in a dull uninterested way he had no curiosity in fact sensation and emotion had left him he was no longer susceptible to pain stomach and nerves had gone to sleep yet the life that was in him drove him on he was very weary but it refused to die it was because it refused to die that he still ate muskeg berries and minnows drank his hot water and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf he followed the trail of the other man who dragged himself along and soon came to the end of it a few fresh picked bones where the soggy moss was marked by the foot pads of many wolves he saw a squat moose hide sack mate to his own which had been torn by sharp teeth he picked it up though its weight was almost too much for his feeble fingers bill had carried it to the last ha ha he would have the laugh on bill he would survive and carry it to the ship in the shining sea his mirth was hoarse and ghastly like a raven's croak and the sick wolf joined him howling lugubriously the man ceased suddenly how could he have the laugh on bill if that were bill if those bones so pinky white and clean were bill he turned away well bill had deserted him but he would not take the gold nor would he suck bill's bones bill would have though had it been the other way around he mused as he staggered on he came to a pool of water stooping over in quest of minnows he jerked his head back as though he had been stung he had caught sight of his reflected face so horrible was it that sensibility awoke long enough to be shocked there were three minnows in the pool which was too large to drain and after several ineffectual attempts to catch them in the tin bucket he forbore he was afraid because of his great weakness that he might fall in and drown it was for this reason that he did not trust himself to the river astride one of the many drift logs which lined its sand spits that day he decreased the distance between him and the ship by three miles the next day by two for he was crawling now as bill had crawled and the end of the fifth day found the ship still seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a day still the indian summer held on and he continued to crawl and faint turn and turn about and ever the sick wolf coughed and wheezed at his heels his knees had become raw meat like his feet and though he padded them with the shirt from his back it was a red track he left behind him on the moss and stones once glancing back he saw the wolf licking hungrily his bleeding trail and he saw sharply what his own end might be unless unless he could get the wolf then began as grim a tragedy of existence as was ever played a sick man that crawled a sick wolf that limped two creatures dragging their dying carcasses across the desolation and hunting each other's lives had it been a well wolf it would not have mattered so much to the man but the thought of going to feed the maw of that loathsome and all but dead thing was repugnant to him he was finicky his mind had begun to wander again and to be perplexed by hallucinations while his lucid intervals grew rarer and shorter he was awakened once from a faint by a wheeze close in his ear the wolf leaped lamely back losing its footing and falling in its weakness it was ludicrous but he was not amused nor was he even afraid he was too far gone for that but his mind was for the moment clear and he lay and considered the ship was no more than four miles away he could see it quite distinctly when he rubbed the mists out of his eyes and he could see the white sail of a small boat cutting the water of the shining sea but he could never crawl those four miles he knew that and was very calm in the knowledge he knew that he could not crawl half a mile and yet he wanted to live it was unreasonable that he should die after all he had undergone fate asked too much of him and dying he declined to die it was stark madness perhaps but in the very grip of death he defied death and refused to die he closed his eyes and composed himself with infinite precaution he steeled himself to keep above the suffocating languor that lapped like a rising tide through all the wells of his being it was very like a sea this deadly languor that rose and rose and drowned his consciousness bit by bit sometimes he was all but submerged swimming through oblivion with a faltering stroke and again by some strange alchemy of soul he would find another shred of will and strike out more strongly without movement he lay on his back and he could hear slowly drawing near and nearer the wheezing intake and output of the sick wolf's breath it drew closer ever closer through an infinitude of time and he did not move it was at his ear the harsh dry tongue grated like sandpaper against his cheek his hands shot out or at least he willed them to shoot out the fingers were curved like talons but they closed on empty air swiftness and certitude require strength and the man had not this strength the patience of the wolf was terrible the man's patience was no less terrible for half a day he lay motionless fighting off unconsciousness and waiting for the thing that was to feed upon him and upon which he wished to feed sometimes the languid sea rose over him and he dreamed long dreams but ever through it all waking and dreaming he waited for the wheezing breath and the harsh caress of the tongue he did not hear the breath and he slipped slowly from some dream to the feel of the tongue along his hand he waited the fangs pressed softly the pressure increased the wolf was exerting its last strength in an effort to sink teeth in the food for which it had waited so long but the man had waited long and the lacerated hand closed on the jaw slowly while the wolf struggled feebly and the hand clutched feebly the other hand crept across to a grip five minutes later the whole weight of the man's body was on top of the wolf the hands had not sufficient strength to choke the wolf but the face of the man was pressed close to the throat of the wolf and the mouth of the man was full of hair at the end of half an hour the man was aware of a warm trickle in his throat it was not pleasant it was like molten lead being forced into his stomach and it was forced by his will alone later the man rolled over on his back and slept there were some members of a scientific expedition on the whale ship _bedford_ from the deck they remarked a strange object on the shore it was moving down the beach toward the water they were unable to classify it and being scientific men they climbed into the whale boat alongside and went ashore to see and they saw something that was alive but which could hardly be called a man it was blind unconscious it squirmed along the ground like some monstrous worm most of its efforts were ineffectual but it was persistent and it writhed and twisted and went ahead perhaps a score of feet an hour three weeks afterward the man lay in a bunk on the whale ship _bedford_ and with tears streaming down his wasted cheeks told who he was and what he had undergone he also babbled incoherently of his mother of sunny southern california and a home among the orange groves and flowers the days were not many after that when he sat at table with the scientific men and ship's officers he gloated over the spectacle of so much food watching it anxiously as it went into the mouths of others with the disappearance of each mouthful an expression of deep regret came into his eyes he was quite sane yet he hated those men at mealtime he was haunted by a fear that the food would not last he inquired of the cook the cabin boy the captain concerning the food stores they reassured him countless times but he could not believe them and pried cunningly about the lazarette to see with his own eyes it was noticed that the man was getting fat he grew stouter with each day the scientific men shook their heads and theorized they limited the man at his meals but still his girth increased and he swelled prodigiously under his shirt the sailors grinned they knew and when the scientific men set a watch on the man they knew too they saw him slouch for'ard after breakfast and like a mendicant with outstretched palm accost a sailor the sailor grinned and passed him a fragment of sea biscuit he clutched it avariciously looked at it as a miser looks at gold and thrust it into his shirt bosom similar were the donations from other grinning sailors the scientific men were discreet they let him alone but they privily examined his bunk it was lined with hardtack the mattress was stuffed with hardtack every nook and cranny was filled with hardtack yet he was sane he was taking precautions against another possible famine that was all he would recover from it the scientific men said and he did ere the _bedford's_ anchor rumbled down in san francisco bay a day's lodging it was the gosh dangdest stampede i ever seen a thousand dog teams hittin the ice you couldn't see m fer smoke two white men an a swede froze to death that night an there was a dozen busted their lungs but didn't i see with my own eyes the bottom of the water hole it was yellow with gold like a mustard plaster that's why i staked the yukon for a minin claim that's what made the stampede an then there was nothin to it that's what i said nothin to it an i ain't got over guessin yet narrative of shorty john messner clung with mittened hand to the bucking gee pole and held the sled in the trail with the other mittened hand he rubbed his cheeks and nose he rubbed his cheeks and nose every little while in point of fact he rarely ceased from rubbing them and sometimes as their numbness increased he rubbed fiercely his forehead was covered by the visor of his fur cap the flaps of which went over his ears the rest of his face was protected by a thick beard golden brown under its coating of frost behind him churned a heavily loaded yukon sled and before him toiled a string of five dogs the rope by which they dragged the sled rubbed against the side of messner's leg when the dogs swung on a bend in the trail he stepped over the rope there were many bends and he was compelled to step over it often sometimes he tripped on the rope or stumbled and at all times he was awkward betraying a weariness so great that the sled now and again ran upon his heels when he came to a straight piece of trail where the sled could get along for a moment without guidance he let go the gee pole and batted his right hand sharply upon the hard wood he found it difficult to keep up the circulation in that hand but while he pounded the one hand he never ceased from rubbing his nose and cheeks with the other it's too cold to travel anyway he said he spoke aloud after the manner of men who are much by themselves only a fool would travel at such a temperature if it isn't eighty below it's because it's seventy nine he pulled out his watch and after some fumbling got it back into the breast pocket of his thick woollen jacket then he surveyed the heavens and ran his eye along the white sky line to the south twelve o'clock he mumbled a clear sky and no sun he plodded on silently for ten minutes and then as though there had been no lapse in his speech he added and no ground covered and it's too cold to travel suddenly he yelled whoa at the dogs and stopped he seemed in a wild panic over his right hand and proceeded to hammer it furiously against the gee pole you poor devils he addressed the dogs which had dropped down heavily on the ice to rest his was a broken jerky utterance caused by the violence with which he hammered his numb hand upon the wood what have you done anyway that a two legged other animal should come along break you to harness curb all your natural proclivities and make slave beasts out of you he rubbed his nose not reflectively but savagely in order to drive the blood into it and urged the dogs to their work again he travelled on the frozen surface of a great river behind him it stretched away in a mighty curve of many miles losing itself in a fantastic jumble of mountains snow covered and silent ahead of him the river split into many channels to accommodate the freight of islands it carried on its breast these islands were silent and white no animals nor humming insects broke the silence no birds flew in the chill air there was no sound of man no mark of the handiwork of man the world slept and it was like the sleep of death john messner seemed succumbing to the apathy of it all the frost was benumbing his spirit he plodded on with bowed head unobservant mechanically rubbing nose and cheeks and batting his steering hand against the gee pole in the straight trail stretches but the dogs were observant and suddenly they stopped turning their heads and looking back at their master out of eyes that were wistful and questioning their eyelashes were frosted white as were their muzzles and they had all the seeming of decrepit old age what of the frost rime and exhaustion the man was about to urge them on when he checked himself roused up with an effort and looked around the dogs had stopped beside a water hole not a fissure but a hole man made chopped laboriously with an axe through three and a half feet of ice a thick skin of new ice showed that it had not been used for some time messner glanced about him the dogs were already pointing the way each wistful and hoary muzzle turned toward the dim snow path that left the main river trail and climbed the bank of the island all right you sore footed brutes he said i'll investigate you're not a bit more anxious to quit than i am he climbed the bank and disappeared the dogs did not lie down but on their feet eagerly waited his return he came back to them took a hauling rope from the front of the sled and put it around his shoulders then he _gee'd_ the dogs to the right and put them at the bank on the run it was a stiff pull but their weariness fell from them as they crouched low to the snow whining with eagerness and gladness as they struggled upward to the last ounce of effort in their bodies when a dog slipped or faltered the one behind nipped his hind quarters the man shouted encouragement and threats and threw all his weight on the hauling rope they cleared the bank with a rush swung to the left and dashed up to a small log cabin it was a deserted cabin of a single room eight feet by ten on the inside messner unharnessed the animals unloaded his sled and took possession the last chance wayfarer had left a supply of firewood messner set up his light sheet iron stove and starred a fire he put five sun cured salmon into the oven to thaw out for the dogs and from the water hole filled his coffee pot and cooking pail while waiting for the water to boil he held his face over the stove the moisture from his breath had collected on his beard and frozen into a great mass of ice and this he proceeded to thaw out as it melted and dropped upon the stove it sizzled and rose about him in steam he helped the process with his fingers working loose small ice chunks that fell rattling to the floor a wild outcry from the dogs without did not take him from his task he heard the wolfish snarling and yelping of strange dogs and the sound of voices a knock came on the door come in messner called in a voice muffled because at the moment he was sucking loose a fragment of ice from its anchorage on his upper lip the door opened and gazing out of his cloud of steam he saw a man and a woman pausing on the threshold come in he said peremptorily and shut the door peering through the steam he could make out but little of their personal appearance the nose and cheek strap worn by the woman and the trail wrappings about her head allowed only a pair of black eyes to be seen the man was dark eyed and smooth shaven all except his mustache which was so iced up as to hide his mouth we just wanted to know if there is any other cabin around here he said at the same time glancing over the unfurnished state of the room we thought this cabin was empty it isn't my cabin messner answered i just found it a few minutes ago come right in and camp plenty of room and you won't need your stove there's room for all at the sound of his voice the woman peered at him with quick curiousness get your things off her companion said to her i'll unhitch and get the water so we can start cooking messner took the thawed salmon outside and fed his dogs he had to guard them against the second team of dogs and when he had reentered the cabin the other man had unpacked the sled and fetched water messner's pot was boiling he threw in the coffee settled it with half a cup of cold water and took the pot from the stove he thawed some sour dough biscuits in the oven at the same time heating a pot of beans he had boiled the night before and that had ridden frozen on the sled all morning removing his utensils from the stove so as to give the newcomers a chance to cook he proceeded to take his meal from the top of his grub box himself sitting on his bed roll between mouthfuls he talked trail and dogs with the man who with head over the stove was thawing the ice from his mustache there were two bunks in the cabin and into one of them when he had cleared his lip the stranger tossed his bed roll we'll sleep here he said unless you prefer this bunk you're the first comer and you have first choice you know that's all right messner answered one bunk's just as good as the other he spread his own bedding in the second bunk and sat down on the edge the stranger thrust a physician's small travelling case under his blankets at one end to serve for a pillow doctor messner"
