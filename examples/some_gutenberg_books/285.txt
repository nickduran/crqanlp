"1" "ready to her call you may speak openly i said and without fear of eavesdroppers we are in the heart of the pyramid here built in every way by a man's length of solid stone myself i oversaw the laying of every course and besides here in yucatan we have not the niceties of your old world diplomacy and do not listen because we count it shame to do so tatho shrugged his shoulders i acted only according to mine education at home a loose tongue makes a loose head and there are those whose trade it is to carry tales still what i say is this the throne shakes and phorenice sees the need of sturdy props so she has sent this proclamation but why come to me it is twenty years since i sailed to this colony and from that day i have not returned to atlantis once i know little of the old country's politics what small parcel of news drifts out to us across the ocean reads with slender interest here yucatan is another world my dear tatho as you in the course of your government will learn with new interests new people new everything to us here atlantis is only a figment a shadow far away across the waters it is for this new world of yucatan that i have striven through all these years if deucalion has small time to spare from his government for brooding over his fatherland atlantis at least has found leisure to admire the deeds of her brilliant son why sir over yonder at home your name carries magic with it when you and i were lads together it was the custom in the colleges to teach that the men of the past were the greatest this world has ever seen but to day this teaching is changed it is deucalion who is held up as the model and example mothers name their sons deucalion as the most valuable birth gift they can make deucalion is a household word indeed there is only one name that is near to it in familiarity you trouble me i said frowning i have tried to do my duty for its own sake and for the country's sake not for the pattings and fondlings of the vulgar and besides if there are names to be in every one's mouth they should be the names of the gods tatho shrugged his shoulders the gods they occupy us very little these latter years with our modern science we have grown past the tether of the older gods and no new one has appeared no my lord deucalion if it were merely the gods who were your competitors on men's lips your name would be a thousand times the better known of mere human names i said the name of this new empress should come first in atlantis our lord the old king being now dead she certainly would have it so replied tatho and there was something in his tone which made me see that more was meant behind the words i drew him to one of the marble seats and bent myself familiarly towards him i am speaking i said not to the new viceroy of yucatan but to my old friend tatho a member of the priests clan like myself with whom i worked side by side in a score of the smaller home governments in hamlets in villages in smaller towns in greater towns as we gained experience in war and knowledge in the art of ruling people and so tediously won our promotion i am speaking in tatho's private abode that was mine own not two hours since and i would have an answer with that plainness which we always then used to one another the new viceroy sighed whimsically i almost forget how to speak in plain words now he said we have grown so polished in these latter days that mere bald truth would be hissed as indelicate but for the memory of those early years when we expended as much law and thought over the ownership of a hay byre as we should now over the fate of a rebellious city i will try and speak plain to you even now deucalion tell me old friend what is it what of this new empress he frowned i might have guessed your subject he said then speak upon it tell me of all the changes that have been made what has this phorenice done to make her throne unstable in atlantis tatho frowned still if i did not know you to be as honest as our lord the sun your questions would carry mischief with them phorenice has a short way with those who are daring enough to discuss her policies for other purpose than politely to praise them you can leave me ignorant if you wish i said with a touch of chill this tatho seemed to be different from the tatho i had known at home tatho my workmate tatho who had read with me in the college of priests who had run with me in many a furious charge who had laboured with me so heavily that the peoples under us might prosper but he was quick enough to see my change of tone you force me back to my old self he said with a half smile though it is hard enough to forget the caution one has learned during the last twenty years even when speaking with you still whatever may have happened to the rest of us it is clear to see that you at least have not changed and old friend i am ready to trust you with my life if you ask it in fact you do ask me that very thing when you tell me to speak all i know of phorenice i nodded this was more like the old times when there was full confidence between us the gods will it now that i return to atlantis i said and what happens after that the gods alone know but it would be of service to me if i could land on her shores with some knowledge of this phorenice for at present i am as ignorant concerning her as some savage from europe or mid africa what would you have me tell tell all i know only that she a woman reigns whereby the ancient law of the land a man should rule that she is not even of the priestly clan from which the law says all rulers must be drawn and that from what you say she has caused the throne to totter the throne was as firm as the everlasting hills in the old king's day tatho history has moved with pace since then and phorenice has spurred it you know her origin i know only the exact little i have told you she was a swineherd's daughter from the mountains though this is never even whispered now as she has declared herself to be a daughter of the gods with a miraculous birth and upbringing as she has decreed it a sacrilege to question this parentage and has ordered to be burnt all those that seem to recollect her more earthly origin the fable passes current for truth you see the faith i put in you deucalion by telling you what you wish to learn there has always been trust between us i know but this habit of suspicion is hard to cast off even with you however let me put your good faith between me and the torture further zaemon you remember was governor of the swineherd's province and zaemon's wife saw phorenice and took her away to adopt and bring up as her own it is said that the swineherd and his woman objected perhaps they did anyway i know they died and phorenice was taught the arts and graces and brought up as a daughter of the priestly clan but still she was an adopted daughter only i objected the omission of the adopted was her will at an early age said tatho dryly and she learnt early to have her wishes carried into fact it was notorious that before she had grown to fifteen years she ruled not only the women of the household but zaemon also and the province that was beyond zaemon zaemon was learned i said and a devout follower of the gods and searcher into the higher mysteries but as a ruler he was always a flabby fellow i do not say that opportunities have not come usefully in phorenice's way but she has genius as well for her to have raised herself at all from what she was was remarkable not one woman out of a thousand placed as she was would have grown to be aught higher than a mere wife of some sturdy countryman who was sufficiently simple to care nothing for pedigree but look at phorenice it was her whim to take exercise as a man at arms and practise with all the utensils of war and then before any one quite knows how or why it happened a rebellion had broken out in the province and here was she a slip of a girl leading zaemon's troops zaemon when i knew him was a mere derision in the field hear me on phorenice put down the rebellion in masterly fashion and gave the conquered a choice between sword and service they fell into her ranks at once and were faithful to her from that moment i tell you deucalion there is a marvellous fascination about the woman her present historian seems to have felt it of course i have every one who sees her comes under her spell and frankly i am in love with her also and look upon my coming here as detestable exile every one near to phorenice high and low loves her just the same even though they know it may be her whim to send them to execution next minute perhaps i let my scorn of this appear you feel contempt for our weakness you were always a strong man deucalion at any rate you see me still unmarried i have found no time to palter with the fripperies of women ah but these colonists here are crude and unfascinating wait till you see the ladies of the court my ascetic it comes to my mind i said dryly that i lived in atlantis before i came out here and at that time i used to see as much of court life as most men yet then also i felt no inducement to marry tatho chuckled atlantis has changed so that you would hardly know the country to day a new era has come over everything especially over the other sex well do i remember the women of the old king's time how monstrous uncomely they were how little they knew how to walk or carry themselves how painfully barbaric was their notion of dress i dare swear that your ladies here in yucatan are not so provincial to day as ours were then but you should see them now at home they are delicious and above all in charm is the empress oh deucalion you shall see phorenice in all her glorious beauty and her magnificence one of these fine days soon and believe me you will go down on your knees and repent i may see and because you say so i may alter my life's ways the gods make all things possible but for the present i remain as i am celibate and not wishful to be otherwise and so in the meantime i would hear the continuance of your history it is one long story of success she deposed zaemon from his government in name as well as in fact and the news was spread and the priestly clan rose in its wrath the two neighbouring governors were bidden join forces take her captive and bring her for execution poor men they tried to obey their orders they attacked her surely enough but in battle she could laugh at them she killed both and made some slaughter amongst their troops and to those that remained alive and became her prisoners she made her usual offer the sword or service naturally they were not long over making their choice to these common people one ruler is much the same as another and so again her army was reinforced three times were bodies of soldiery sent against her and three times was she victorious the last was a final effort before it had been customary to despise this adventuress who had sprung up so suddenly but then the priests began to realise their peril to see that the throne itself was in danger and to know that if she were to be crushed they would have to put forth their utmost every man who could carry arms was pressed into the service every known art of war was ordered to be put into employment it was the largest army and the best equipped army that atlantis then had ever raised and the priestly clan saw fit to put in supreme command their general tatho you i cried even myself deucalion and mark you i fought my utmost i was not her creature then and when i set out because they wanted to spur me to the uttermost the high council of the priests pointed out my prospects the king we had known so long was ailing and wearily old he was so wrapped up in the study of the mysteries and the joy of closely knowing them that earthly matters had grown nauseous to him and at any time he might decide to die the priestly clan uses its own discretion in the election of a new king but it takes note of popular sentiment and a general who at the critical time could come home victorious from a great campaign which moreover would release a harassed people from the constant application of arms would be the idol of the moment these things were pointed out to me solemnly and in the full council what they promised you the throne even that so you see i set out with a high stake before me phorenice i had never seen and i swore to take her alive and give her to be the sport of my soldiery i had a fine confidence in my own strategy then deucalion but the old gods in whom i trusted then remained old taught me no new thing i drilled and exercised my army according to the forms you and i learnt together old comrade and in many a tough fight found to serve well i armed them with the choicest weapons we knew of then with sling and mace with bow and spear with axe and knife with sword and the throwing fire their bodies i covered with metal plates even their bellies i cared for with droves of cattle driven in the rear of the fighting troops but when the encounter came they might have been men of straw for all the harm they did out of her own brain phorenice had made fire tubes that cast a dart which would kill beyond two bowshots and the fashion in which she handled her troops dazzled me they threatened us on one flank they harassed us on the other it was not war as we had been accustomed to it was a newer and more deadly game and i had to watch my splendid army eaten away as waves eat a sandhill never once did i get a chance of forcing close action these new tactics that had come from phorenice's invention were beyond my art to meet or understand we were eight to her one and our close packed numbers only made us so much the more easy for slaughter a panic came and those who could fled myself i had no wish to go back and earn the axe that waits for the unsuccessful general i tried to die there fighting where i stood but death would not come it was a fine melee deucalion that last one and so she took you i stood with three others back to back with a ring of dead round us and a ring of the enemy hemming us in we taunted them to come on but at hand to hand courtesies we had shown we could hold our own and so they were calling for fire tubes with which they could strike us down in safety from a distance then up came phorenice what is this to do says she we seek to kill lord tatho who led against you say they so that is tatho says she a fine figure of a man indeed and a pretty fighter seemingly after the old manner doubtless he is one who would acquire the newer method see now tatho says she it is my custom to offer those i vanquish either the sword which believe me was never nearer your neck than now or service under my banner will you make a choice woman i said fairest that ever i saw finest general the world has ever borne you tempt me sorely by your qualities but there is a tradition in our clan that we should be true to the salt we eat i am the king's man still and so i can take no service from you the king is dead says she a runner has just brought the tidings meaning them to have fallen into your hands and i am the empress who made you empress i asked the same most capable hand that has given me this battle says she it is a capable hand as you have seen it can be a kind hand also as you may learn if you choose with the king dead tatho is a masterless man now is tatho in want of a mistress such a glorious mistress as you i said yes and from that moment deucalion i have been her slave oh you may frown you may get up from this seat and walk away if you will but i ask you this keep back your worst judgment of me old friend till after you have seen phorenice herself in the warm and lovely flesh then your own ears and your own senses will be my advocates to win me back your old esteem 2 back to atlantis the words of tatho were no sleeping draught for me that night i began to think that i had made somewhat a mistake in wrapping myself up so entirely in my government of yucatan and not contriving to keep more in touch with events that were passing at home in atlantis for many years past it had been easy to see that the mariner folk who did traffic across the seas spoke with restraint and that only what news the empress pleased was allowed to ooze out beyond her borders but as i say i was fully occupied with my work in the colony and had no curiosity to pull away a veil intentionally placed besides it has always been against my principles to put to the torture men who had received orders for silence from their superiors merely that they shall break these orders for my private convenience however the iron discipline of our priestly clan left me no choice of procedure as was customary i had been deprived of my office at a moment's notice from that time on all papers and authority belonged to my successor and although by courtesy i might be permitted to remain as a guest in the pyramid that had so recently been mine to see another sunrise it was clearly enjoined that i must leave the territory then at the topmost of my speed and hasten to report in atlantis tatho to give him credit was anxious to further my interests to the utmost in his power he was by my side again before the dawn putting all his resources at my disposal i had little enough to ask him a ship to take me home i said and i shall be your debtor the request seemed to surprise him that you may certainly have if you wish it but my ships are foul with the long passage and are in need of a careen if you take them you will make a slow voyage of it to atlantis why do you not take your own navy the ships are in harbour now for i saw them there when we came in brave ships they are too but not mine that navy belongs to yucatan well deucalion you are yucatan or rather you were yesterday and have been these twenty years i saw what he meant and the idea did not please me i answered stiffly enough that the ships were owned by private merchants or belonged to the state and i could not claim so much as a ten slave galley tatho shrugged his shoulders i suppose you know your own policies best he said though to me it seems but risky for a man who has attained to a position like yours and mine not to have provided himself with a stout navy of his own one never knows when a recall may be sent and through lack of these precautions a life's earnings may very well be lost in a dozen hours i have no fear for mine i said coldly of course not because you know me to be your friend but had another man been appointed to this vice royalty you might have been sadly shorn deucalion it is not many fellows who can resist a snug hoard ready and waiting in the very coffers they have come to line my lord tatho i said it is clear to me that you and i have grown to be of different tastes all of the hoard that i have made for myself in this colony few men would covet i have the poor clothes you see me in this moment and a box of drugs such as i have found useful to the stomach i possess also three slaves two of them scribes and the third a sturdy savage from europe who cooks my victual and fills for me the bath for my maintenance during my years of service here i have bled the state of a soldier's ration and nothing beyond and if in my name any man has mulcted a creature in yucatan of so much as an ounce of bronze i request you as a last service to have that man hanged for me as a liar and a thief tatho looked at me curiously i do not know whether i admire you most or whether i pity i do not know whether to be astonished or to despise we had heard of much of your uprightness over yonder in atlantis of your sternness and your justice but i swear by the old gods that no soul guessed you carried your fancy so far as this why man money is power with money and the resources money can buy nothing could stop a fellow like you whilst without it you may be tripped up and trodden down irrevocably at the first puny reverse the gods will choose my fate possibly but for mine i prefer to nourish it myself i tell you with frankness that i have not come here to follow in the pattern you have made for a vice royalty i shall govern yucatan wisely and well to the best of my ability but i shall govern it also for the good of tatho the viceroy i have brought with me here my navy of eight ships and a personal bodyguard there is my wife also and her women and her slaves all these must be provided for and why indeed should it be otherwise if a people is to be governed it should be their privilege to pay handsomely for their prince we shall not agree on this you have the power now and can employ it as you choose if i thought it would be of any use i should like to supplicate you most humbly to deal with lenience when you come to tax these people who are under you they have grown very dear to me i have disgusted you with me and i am grieved for it but even to retain your good opinion deucalion which i value more than that of any man living i cannot do here as you have done it would be impossible even if i wished it you must not judge all other men by your own strong standard a tatho is by no means a colossus like a deucalion and besides i have a wife and children and they must be provided for even if i neglect myself ah there i said it does seem that i possess the advantage i have no wife to clog me he caught up my word quickly it seems to me you have nothing that makes life worth living you have neither wife children riches cooks retinue dresses nor anything else in proportion to your station you will pardon my saying it old comrade but you are plaguey ignorant about some matters for example you do not know how to dine during every day of a very weary voyage i have promised myself when sitting before the meagre sea victual that presently the abstinence would be more than repaid by deucalion's welcoming feast oh i tell you that feast was one of the vividest things that ever came before my eyes and then when we get to the actuality what was it why a country farmer every day sits down to more delicate fare you told me how it was prepared well your savage from europe may be lusty and perchance is faithful but he is a devil possessed cook gods i have lived better on a campaign i know this is a colony here without any of the home refinements but if in the days to come the deer of the forest the fish of the stream and the other resources of the place are not put to better use than heretofore i shall see it my duty as ruler to fry some of the kitchen staff alive in grease so as to encourage better cookery gods deucalion have you forgotten what it is to have a palate and have you no esteem for your own dignity man look at your clothes you are garbed like a herdsman and you have not a gaud or a jewel to brighten you i eat i said coldly when my hunger bids me and i carry this one robe upon my person till it is worn out and needs replacement the grossness of excessive banqueting and the effeminacy of many clothes are attainments that never met my fancy but i think we have talked here over long and there seems little chance of our finding agreement you have changed tatho with the years and perhaps i have changed also these alterations creep imperceptibly into one's being as time advances let us part now and forgetting these present differences remember only our friendship of twenty years agone that for me at any rate has always had a pleasant savour when called up into the memory tatho bowed his head so be it he said and i would still charge myself upon your bounty for that ship dawn cannot be far off now and it is not decent that the man who has ruled here so long should walk in daylight through the streets on the morning after his dismissal so be it said tatho you shall have my poor navy i could have wished that you had asked me something greater not the navy tatho one small ship believe me more is wasted now there said tatho i shall act the tyrant i am viceroy here now and will have my way in this you may go naked of all possessions that i cannot help but depart for atlantis unattended that you shall not and so in fine as the choice was set beyond me it was in the bear tatho's own private ship with all the rest of his navy sailing in escort that i did finally make my transit but the start was not immediate the vessels lay moored against the stone quays of the inner harbour gutted of their stores and with crews exhausted and it would have been suicide to have forced them out then and there to again take the seas so the courtesies were fulfilled by the craft whereon i abode hauling out into the entrance basin and anchoring there in the swells of the fairway and forthwith she and her consorts took in wood and water cured meat and fish ashore and refitted in all needful ways with all speed attainable for myself there came then as the first time during twenty busy years a breathing space from work i had no further connection with the country of my labours indeed officially i had left it already into the working of the ship it was contrary to rule that i should make any inspection or interest since all sea matters were the exclusive property of the mariners guild secured to them by royal patent and most jealously guarded so there remained to me in my day hours to gaze if i would upon the quays the harbours the palaces and the pyramids of the splendid city before me which i had seen grow stone by stone from its foundations or to roam my eye over the"
