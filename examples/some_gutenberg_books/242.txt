"1" "i kept as still as i could nothing happened i did not expect anything to happen i was something that lay under the sun and felt it like the pumpkins and i did not want to be anything more i was entirely happy perhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something entire whether it is sun and air or goodness and knowledge at any rate that is happiness to be dissolved into something complete and great when it comes to one it comes as naturally as sleep iii on sunday morning otto fuchs was to drive us over to make the acquaintance of our new bohemian neighbours we were taking them some provisions as they had come to live on a wild place where there was no garden or chicken house and very little broken land fuchs brought up a sack of potatoes and a piece of cured pork from the cellar and grandmother packed some loaves of saturday's bread a jar of butter and several pumpkin pies in the straw of the wagon box we clambered up to the front seat and jolted off past the little pond and along the road that climbed to the big cornfield i could hardly wait to see what lay beyond that cornfield but there was only red grass like ours and nothing else though from the high wagon seat one could look off a long way the road ran about like a wild thing avoiding the deep draws crossing them where they were wide and shallow and all along it wherever it looped or ran the sunflowers grew some of them were as big as little trees with great rough leaves and many branches which bore dozens of blossoms they made a gold ribbon across the prairie occasionally one of the horses would tear off with his teeth a plant full of blossoms and walk along munching it the flowers nodding in time to his bites as he ate down toward them the bohemian family grandmother told me as we drove along had bought the homestead of a fellow countryman peter krajiek and had paid him more than it was worth their agreement with him was made before they left the old country through a cousin of his who was also a relative of mrs shimerda the shimerdas were the first bohemian family to come to this part of the county krajiek was their only interpreter and could tell them anything he chose they could not speak enough english to ask for advice or even to make their most pressing wants known one son fuchs said was well grown and strong enough to work the land but the father was old and frail and knew nothing about farming he was a weaver by trade had been a skilled workman on tapestries and upholstery materials he had brought his fiddle with him which wouldn't be of much use here though he used to pick up money by it at home if they're nice people i hate to think of them spending the winter in that cave of krajiek's said grandmother it's no better than a badger hole no proper dugout at all and i hear he's made them pay twenty dollars for his old cookstove that ain't worth ten yes'm said otto and he's sold em his oxen and his two bony old horses for the price of good workteams i'd have interfered about the horses the old man can understand some german if i'd i a thought it would do any good but bohemians has a natural distrust of austrians grandmother looked interested now why is that otto fuchs wrinkled his brow and nose well ma'm it's politics it would take me a long while to explain the land was growing rougher i was told that we were approaching squaw creek which cut up the west half of the shimerdas place and made the land of little value for farming soon we could see the broken grassy clay cliffs which indicated the windings of the stream and the glittering tops of the cottonwoods and ash trees that grew down in the ravine some of the cottonwoods had already turned and the yellow leaves and shining white bark made them look like the gold and silver trees in fairy tales as we approached the shimerdas dwelling i could still see nothing but rough red hillocks and draws with shelving banks and long roots hanging out where the earth had crumbled away presently against one of those banks i saw a sort of shed thatched with the same wine coloured grass that grew everywhere near it tilted a shattered windmill frame that had no wheel we drove up to this skeleton to tie our horses and then i saw a door and window sunk deep in the drawbank the door stood open and a woman and a girl of fourteen ran out and looked up at us hopefully a little girl trailed along behind them the woman had on her head the same embroidered shawl with silk fringes that she wore when she had alighted from the train at black hawk she was not old but she was certainly not young her face was alert and lively with a sharp chin and shrewd little eyes she shook grandmother's hand energetically very glad very glad she ejaculated immediately she pointed to the bank out of which she had emerged and said house no good house no good grandmother nodded consolingly you'll get fixed up comfortable after while mrs shimerda make good house my grandmother always spoke in a very loud tone to foreigners as if they were deaf she made mrs shimerda understand the friendly intention of our visit and the bohemian woman handled the loaves of bread and even smelled them and examined the pies with lively curiosity exclaiming much good much thank and again she wrung grandmother's hand the oldest son ambroz they called it ambrosch came out of the cave and stood beside his mother he was nineteen years old short and broad backed with a close cropped flat head and a wide flat face his hazel eyes were little and shrewd like his mother's but more sly and suspicious they fairly snapped at the food the family had been living on corncakes and sorghum molasses for three days the little girl was pretty but antonia they accented the name thus strongly when they spoke to her was still prettier i remembered what the conductor had said about her eyes they were big and warm and full of light like the sun shining on brown pools in the wood her skin was brown too and in her cheeks she had a glow of rich dark colour her brown hair was curly and wild looking the little sister whom they called yulka julka was fair and seemed mild and obedient while i stood awkwardly confronting the two girls krajiek came up from the barn to see what was going on with him was another shimerda son even from a distance one could see that there was something strange about this boy as he approached us he began to make uncouth noises and held up his hands to show us his fingers which were webbed to the first knuckle like a duck's foot when he saw me draw back he began to crow delightedly hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo like a rooster his mother scowled and said sternly marek then spoke rapidly to krajiek in bohemian she wants me to tell you he won't hurt nobody mrs burden he was born like that the others are smart ambrosch he make good farmer he struck ambrosch on the back and the boy smiled knowingly at that moment the father came out of the hole in the bank he wore no hat and his thick iron grey hair was brushed straight back from his forehead it was so long that it bushed out behind his ears and made him look like the old portraits i remembered in virginia he was tall and slender and his thin shoulders stooped he looked at us understandingly then took grandmother's hand and bent over it i noticed how white and well shaped his own hands were they looked calm somehow and skilled his eyes were melancholy and were set back deep under his brow his face was ruggedly formed but it looked like ashes like something from which all the warmth and light had died out everything about this old man was in keeping with his dignified manner he was neatly dressed under his coat he wore a knitted grey vest and instead of a collar a silk scarf of a dark bronze green carefully crossed and held together by a red coral pin while krajiek was translating for mr shimerda antonia came up to me and held out her hand coaxingly in a moment we were running up the steep drawside together yulka trotting after us when we reached the level and could see the gold tree tops i pointed toward them and antonia laughed and squeezed my hand as if to tell me how glad she was i had come we raced off toward squaw creek and did not stop until the ground itself stopped fell away before us so abruptly that the next step would have been out into the tree tops we stood panting on the edge of the ravine looking down at the trees and bushes that grew below us the wind was so strong that i had to hold my hat on and the girls skirts were blown out before them antonia seemed to like it she held her little sister by the hand and chattered away in that language which seemed to me spoken so much more rapidly than mine she looked at me her eyes fairly blazing with things she could not say name what name she asked touching me on the shoulder i told her my name and she repeated it after me and made yulka say it she pointed into the gold cottonwood tree behind whose top we stood and said again what name we sat down and made a nest in the long red grass yulka curled up like a baby rabbit and played with a grasshopper antonia pointed up to the sky and questioned me with her glance i gave her the word but she was not satisfied and pointed to my eyes i told her and she repeated the word making it sound like ice she pointed up to the sky then to my eyes then back to the sky with movements so quick and impulsive that she distracted me and i had no idea what she wanted she got up on her knees and wrung her hands she pointed to her own eyes and shook her head then to mine and to the sky nodding violently oh i exclaimed blue blue sky she clapped her hands and murmured blue sky blue eyes as if it amused her while we snuggled down there out of the wind she learned a score of words she was alive and very eager we were so deep in the grass that we could see nothing but the blue sky over us and the gold tree in front of us it was wonderfully pleasant after antonia had said the new words over and over she wanted to give me a little chased silver ring she wore on her middle finger when she coaxed and insisted i repulsed her quite sternly i didn't want her ring and i felt there was something reckless and extravagant about her wishing to give it away to a boy she had never seen before no wonder krajiek got the better of these people if this was how they behaved while we were disputing about the ring i heard a mournful voice calling antonia antonia she sprang up like a hare tatinek tatinek she shouted and we ran to meet the old man who was coming toward us antonia reached him first took his hand and kissed it when i came up he touched my shoulder and looked searchingly down into my face for several seconds i became somewhat embarrassed for i was used to being taken for granted by my elders we went with mr shimerda back to the dugout where grandmother was waiting for me before i got into the wagon he took a book out of his pocket opened it and showed me a page with two alphabets one english and the other bohemian he placed this book in my grandmother's hands looked at her entreatingly and said with an earnestness which i shall never forget te e ach te e ach my antonia iv on the afternoon of that same sunday i took my first long ride on my pony under otto's direction after that dude and i went twice a week to the post office six miles east of us and i saved the men a good deal of time by riding on errands to our neighbours when we had to borrow anything or to send about word that there would be preaching at the sod schoolhouse i was always the messenger formerly fuchs attended to such things after working hours all the years that have passed have not dimmed my memory of that first glorious autumn the new country lay open before me there were no fences in those days and i could choose my own way over the grass uplands trusting the pony to get me home again sometimes i followed the sunflower bordered roads fuchs told me that the sunflowers were introduced into that country by the mormons that at the time of the persecution when they left missouri and struck out into the wilderness to find a place where they could worship god in their own way the members of the first exploring party crossing the plains to utah scattered sunflower seed as they went the next summer when the long trains of wagons came through with all the women and children they had the sunflower trail to follow i believe that botanists do not confirm fuchs's story but insist that the sunflower was native to those plains nevertheless that legend has stuck in my mind and sunflower bordered roads always seem to me the roads to freedom i used to love to drift along the pale yellow cornfields looking for the damp spots one sometimes found at their edges where the smartweed soon turned a rich copper colour and the narrow brown leaves hung curled like cocoons about the swollen joints of the stem sometimes i went south to visit our german neighbours and to admire their catalpa grove or to see the big elm tree that grew up out of a deep crack in the earth and had a hawk's nest in its branches trees were so rare in that country and they had to make such a hard fight to grow that we used to feel anxious about them and visit them as if they were persons it must have been the scarcity of detail in that tawny landscape that made detail so precious sometimes i rode north to the big prairie dog town to watch the brown earth owls fly home in the late afternoon and go down to their nests underground with the dogs antonia shimerda liked to go with me and we used to wonder a great deal about these birds of subterranean habit we had to be on our guard there for rattlesnakes were always lurking about they came to pick up an easy living among the dogs and owls which were quite defenceless against them took possession of their comfortable houses and ate the eggs and puppies we felt sorry for the owls it was always mournful to see them come flying home at sunset and disappear under the earth but after all we felt winged things who would live like that must be rather degraded creatures the dog town was a long way from any pond or creek otto fuchs said he had seen populous dog towns in the desert where there was no surface water for fifty miles he insisted that some of the holes must go down to water nearly two hundred feet hereabouts antonia said she didn't believe it that the dogs probably lapped up the dew in the early morning like the rabbits antonia had opinions about everything and she was soon able to make them known almost every day she came running across the prairie to have her reading lesson with me mrs shimerda grumbled but realized it was important that one member of the family should learn english when the lesson was over we used to go up to the watermelon patch behind the garden i split the melons with an old corn knife and we lifted out the hearts and ate them with the juice trickling through our fingers the white christmas melons we did not touch but we watched them with curiosity they were to be picked late when the hard frosts had set in and put away for winter use after weeks on the ocean the shimerdas were famished for fruit the two girls would wander for miles along the edge of the cornfields hunting for ground cherries antonia loved to help grandmother in the kitchen and to learn about cooking and housekeeping she would stand beside her watching her every movement we were willing to believe that mrs shimerda was a good housewife in her own country but she managed poorly under new conditions the conditions were bad enough certainly i remember how horrified we were at the sour ashy grey bread she gave her family to eat she mixed her dough we discovered in an old tin peck measure that krajiek had used about the barn when she took the paste out to bake it she left smears of dough sticking to the sides of the measure put the measure on the shelf behind the stove and let this residue ferment the next time she made bread she scraped this sour stuff down into the fresh dough to serve as yeast during those first months the shimerdas never went to town krajiek encouraged them in the belief that in black hawk they would somehow be mysteriously separated from their money they hated krajiek but they clung to him because he was the only human being with whom they could talk or from whom they could get information he slept with the old man and the two boys in the dugout barn along with the oxen they kept him in their hole and fed him for the same reason that the prairie dogs and the brown owls house the rattlesnakes because they did not know how to get rid of him v we knew that things were hard for our bohemian neighbours but the two girls were lighthearted and never complained they were always ready to forget their troubles at home and to run away with me over the prairie scaring rabbits or starting up flocks of quail i remember antonia's excitement when she came into our kitchen one afternoon and announced my papa find friends up north with russian mans last night he take me for see and i can understand very much talk nice mans mrs burden one is fat and all the time laugh everybody laugh the first time i see my papa laugh in this kawntree oh very nice i asked her if she meant the two russians who lived up by the big dog town i had often been tempted to go to see them when i was riding in that direction but one of them was a wild looking fellow and i was a little afraid of him russia seemed to me more remote than any other country farther away than china almost as far as the north pole of all the strange uprooted people among the first settlers those two men were the strangest and the most aloof their last names were unpronounceable so they were called pavel and peter they went about making signs to people and until the shimerdas came they had no friends krajiek could understand them a little but he had cheated them in a trade so they avoided him pavel the tall one was said to be an anarchist since he had no means of imparting his opinions probably his wild gesticulations and his generally excited and rebellious manner gave rise to this supposition he must once have been a very strong man but now his great frame with big knotty joints had a wasted look and the skin was drawn tight over his high cheekbones his breathing was hoarse and he always had a cough peter his companion was a very different sort of fellow short bow legged and as fat as butter he always seemed pleased when he met people on the road smiled and took off his cap to everyone men as well as women at a distance on his wagon he looked like an old man his hair and beard were of such a pale flaxen colour that they seemed white in the sun they were as thick and curly as carded wool his rosy face with its snub nose set in this fleece was like a melon among its leaves he was usually called curly peter or rooshian peter the two russians made good farm hands and in summer they worked out together i had heard our neighbours laughing when they told how peter always had to go home at night to milk his cow other bachelor homesteaders used canned milk to save trouble sometimes peter came to church at the sod schoolhouse it was there i first saw him sitting on a low bench by the door his plush cap in his hands his bare feet tucked apologetically under the seat after mr shimerda discovered the russians he went to see them almost every evening and sometimes took antonia with him she said they came from a part of russia where the language was not very different from bohemian and if i wanted to go to their place she could talk to them for me one afternoon before the heavy frosts began we rode up there together on my pony the russians had a neat log house built on a grassy slope with a windlass well beside the door as we rode up the draw we skirted a big melon patch and a garden where squashes and yellow cucumbers lay about on the sod we found peter out behind his kitchen bending over a washtub he was working so hard that he did not hear us coming his whole body moved up and down as he rubbed and he was a funny sight from the rear with his shaggy head and bandy legs when he straightened himself up to greet us drops of perspiration were rolling from his thick nose down onto his curly beard peter dried his hands and seemed glad to leave his washing he took us down to see his chickens and his cow that was grazing on the hillside he told antonia that in his country only rich people had cows but here any man could have one who would take care of her the milk was good for pavel who was often sick and he could make butter by beating sour cream with a wooden spoon peter was very fond of his cow he patted her flanks and talked to her in russian while he pulled up her lariat pin and set it in a new place after he had shown us his garden peter trundled a load of watermelons up the hill in his wheelbarrow pavel was not at home he was off somewhere helping to dig a well the house i thought very comfortable for two men who were batching besides the kitchen there was a living room with a wide double bed built against the wall properly made up with blue gingham sheets and pillows there was a little storeroom too with a window where they kept guns and saddles and tools and old coats and boots that day the floor was covered with garden things drying for winter corn and beans and fat yellow cucumbers there were no screens or window blinds in the house and all the doors and windows stood wide open letting in flies and sunshine alike peter put the melons in a row on the oilcloth covered table and stood over them brandishing a butcher knife before the blade got fairly into them they split of their own ripeness with a delicious sound he gave us knives but no plates and the top of the table was soon swimming with juice and seeds i had never seen anyone eat so many melons as peter ate he assured us that they were good for one better than medicine in his country people lived on them at this time of year he was very hospitable and jolly once while he was looking at antonia he sighed and told us that if he had stayed at home in russia perhaps by this time he would have had a pretty daughter of his own to cook and keep house for him he said he had left his country because of a great trouble when we got up to go peter looked about in perplexity for something that would entertain us he ran into the storeroom and brought out a gaudily painted harmonica sat down on a bench and spreading his fat legs apart began to play like a whole band the tunes were either very lively or very doleful and he sang words to some of them before we left peter put ripe cucumbers into a sack for mrs shimerda and gave us a lard pail full of milk to cook them in i had never heard of cooking cucumbers but antonia assured me they were very good we had to walk the pony all the way home to keep from spilling the milk vi one afternoon we were having our reading lesson on the warm grassy bank where the badger lived it was a day of amber sunlight but there was a shiver of coming winter in the air i had seen ice on the little horsepond that morning and as we went through the garden we found the tall asparagus with its red berries lying on the ground a mass of slimy green tony was barefooted and she shivered in her cotton dress and was comfortable only when we were tucked down on the baked earth in the full blaze of the sun she could talk to me about almost anything by this time that afternoon she was telling me how highly esteemed our friend the badger was in her part of the world and how men kept a special kind of dog with very short legs to hunt him those dogs she said went down into the hole after the badger and killed him there in a terrific struggle underground you could hear the barks and yelps outside then the dog dragged himself back covered with bites and scratches to be rewarded and petted by his master she knew a dog who had a star on his collar for every badger he had killed the rabbits were unusually spry that afternoon they kept starting up all about us and dashing off down the draw as if they were playing a game of some kind but the little buzzing things that lived in the grass were all dead all but one while we were lying there against the warm bank a little insect of the palest frailest green hopped painfully out of the buffalo grass and tried to leap into a bunch of bluestem he missed it fell back and sat with his head sunk between his long legs his antennae quivering as if he were waiting for something to come and finish him tony made a warm nest for him in her hands talked to him gaily and indulgently in bohemian presently he began to sing for us a thin rusty little chirp she held him close to her ear and laughed but a moment afterward i saw there were tears in her eyes she told me that in her village at home there was an old beggar woman who went about selling herbs and roots she had dug up in the forest if you took her in and gave her a warm place by the fire she sang old songs to the children in a cracked voice like this old hata she was called and the children loved to see her coming and saved their cakes and sweets for her when the bank on the other side of the draw began to throw a narrow shelf of shadow we knew we ought to be starting homeward the chill came on quickly when the sun got low and antonia's dress was thin what were we to do with the frail little creature we had lured back to life by false pretences i offered my pockets but tony shook her head and carefully put the green insect in her hair tying her big handkerchief down loosely over her curls i said i would go with her until we could see squaw creek and then turn and run home we drifted along lazily very happy through the magical light of the late afternoon all those fall afternoons were the same but i never got used to them as far as we could see the miles of copper red grass were drenched in sunlight that was stronger and fiercer than at any other time of the day the blond cornfields were red gold the haystacks turned rosy
