enough the sale was made on the very day that the coal venture had returned with its rich freight as i have said the couple were speechless they sat dazed and blissful that night trying to realize that they were actually worth a hundred thousand dollars in clean imaginary cash yet so it was it was the last time that ever aleck was afraid of a margin at least afraid enough to let it break her sleep and pale her cheek to the extent that this first experience in that line had done indeed it was a memorable night gradually the realization that they were rich sank securely home into the souls of the pair then they began to place the money if we could have looked out through the eyes of these dreamers we should have seen their tidy little wooden house disappear and two story brick with a cast iron fence in front of it take its place we should have seen a three globed gas chandelier grow down from the parlor ceiling we should have seen the homely rag carpet turn to noble brussels a dollar and a half a yard we should have seen the plebeian fireplace vanish away and a recherche big base burner with isinglass windows take position and spread awe around and we should have seen other things too among them the buggy the lap robe the stove pipe hat and so on from that time forth although the daughters and the neighbors saw only the same old wooden house there it was a two story brick to aleck and sally and not a night went by that aleck did not worry about the imaginary gas bills and get for all comfort sally's reckless retort what of it we can afford it before the couple went to bed that first night that they were rich they had decided that they must celebrate they must give a party that was the idea but how to explain it to the daughters and the neighbors they could not expose the fact that they were rich sally was willing even anxious to do it but aleck kept her head and would not allow it she said that although the money was as good as in it would be as well to wait until it was actually in on that policy she took her stand and would not budge the great secret must be kept she said kept from the daughters and everybody else the pair were puzzled they must celebrate they were determined to celebrate but since the secret must be kept what could they celebrate no birthdays were due for three months tilbury wasn't available evidently he was going to live forever what the nation _could _they celebrate that was sally's way of putting it and he was getting impatient too and harassed but at last he hit it just by sheer inspiration as it seemed to him and all their troubles were gone in a moment they would celebrate the discovery of america a splendid idea aleck was almost too proud of sally for words she said _she _never would have thought of it but sally although he was bursting with delight in the compliment and with wonder at himself tried not to let on and said it wasn't really anything anybody could have done it whereat aleck with a prideful toss of her happy head said oh certainly anybody could oh anybody hosannah dilkins for instance or maybe adelbert peanut oh _dear_ yes well i'd like to see them try it that's all dear me suz if they could think of the discovery of a forty acre island it's more than _i_ believe they could and as for the whole continent why sally foster you know perfectly well it would strain the livers and lights out of them and _then_ they couldn't the dear woman she knew he had talent and if affection made her over estimate the size of it a little surely it was a sweet and gentle crime and forgivable for its source's sake chapter v the celebration went off well the friends were all present both the young and the old among the young were flossie and gracie peanut and their brother adelbert who was a rising young journeyman tinner also hosannah dilkins jr journeyman plasterer just out of his apprenticeship for many months adelbert and hosannah had been showing interest in gwendolen and clytemnestra foster and the parents of the girls had noticed this with private satisfaction but they suddenly realized now that that feeling had passed they recognized that the changed financial conditions had raised up a social bar between their daughters and the young mechanics the daughters could now look higher and must yes must they need marry nothing below the grade of lawyer or merchant poppa and momma would take care of this there must be no mesalliances however these thinkings and projects of theirs were private and did not show on the surface and therefore threw no shadow upon the celebration what showed upon the surface was a serene and lofty contentment and a dignity of carriage and gravity of deportment which compelled the admiration and likewise the wonder of the company all noticed it and all commented upon it but none was able to divine the secret of it it was a marvel and a mystery three several persons remarked without suspecting what clever shots they were making it's as if they'd come into property that was just it indeed most mothers would have taken hold of the matrimonial matter in the old regulation way they would have given the girls a talking to of a solemn sort and untactful a lecture calculated to defeat its own purpose by producing tears and secret rebellion and the said mothers would have further damaged the business by requesting the young mechanics to discontinue their attentions but this mother was different she was practical she said nothing to any of the young people concerned nor to any one else except sally he listened to her and understood understood and admired he said i get the idea instead of finding fault with the samples on view thus hurting feelings and obstructing trade without occasion you merely offer a higher class of goods for the money and leave nature to take her course it's wisdom aleck solid wisdom and sound as a nut who's your fish have you nominated him yet no she hadn't they must look the market over which they did to start with they considered and discussed brandish rising young lawyer and fulton rising young dentist sally must invite them to dinner but not right away there was no hurry aleck said keep an eye on the pair and wait nothing would be lost by going slowly in so important a matter it turned out that this was wisdom too for inside of three weeks aleck made a wonderful strike which swelled her imaginary hundred thousand to four hundred thousand of the same quality she and sally were in the clouds that evening for the first time they introduced champagne at dinner not real champagne but plenty real enough for the amount of imagination expended on it it was sally that did it and aleck weakly submitted at bottom both were troubled and ashamed for he was a high up son of temperance and at funerals wore an apron which no dog could look upon and retain his reason and his opinion and she was a w c t u with all that that implies of boiler iron virtue and unendurable holiness but there it was the pride of riches was beginning its disintegrating work they had lived to prove once more a sad truth which had been proven many times before in the world that whereas principle is a great and noble protection against showy and degrading vanities and vices poverty is worth six of it more than four hundred thousand dollars to the good they took up the matrimonial matter again neither the dentist nor the lawyer was mentioned there was no occasion they were out of the running disqualified they discussed the son of the pork packer and the son of the village banker but finally as in the previous case they concluded to wait and think and go cautiously and sure luck came their way again aleck ever watchful saw a great and risky chance and took a daring flyer a time of trembling of doubt of awful uneasiness followed for non success meant absolute ruin and nothing short of it then came the result and aleck faint with joy could hardly control her voice when she said the suspense is over sally and we are worth a cold million sally wept for gratitude and said oh electra jewel of women darling of my heart we are free at last we roll in wealth we need never scrimp again it's a case for veuve cliquot and he got out a pint of spruce beer and made sacrifice he saying damn the expense and she rebuking him gently with reproachful but humid and happy eyes they shelved the pork packer's son and the banker's son and sat down to consider the governor's son and the son of the congressman chapter vi it were a weariness to follow in detail the leaps and bounds the foster fictitious finances took from this time forth it was marvelous it was dizzying it was dazzling everything aleck touched turned to fairy gold and heaped itself glittering toward the firmament millions upon millions poured in and still the mighty stream flowed thundering along still its vast volume increased five millions ten millions twenty thirty was there never to be an end two years swept by in a splendid delirium the intoxicated fosters scarcely noticing the flight of time they were now worth three hundred million dollars they were in every board of directors of every prodigious combine in the country and still as time drifted along the millions went on piling up five at a time ten at a time as fast as they could tally them off almost the three hundred double itself then doubled again and yet again and yet once more twenty four hundred millions the business was getting a little confused it was necessary to take an account of stock and straighten it out the fosters knew it they felt it they realized that it was imperative but they also knew that to do it properly and perfectly the task must be carried to a finish without a break when once it was begun a ten hours job and where could _they _find ten leisure hours in a bunch sally was selling pins and sugar and calico all day and every day aleck was cooking and washing dishes and sweeping and making beds all day and every day with none to help for the daughters were being saved up for high society the fosters knew there was one way to get the ten hours and only one both were ashamed to name it each waited for the other to do it finally sally said somebody's got to give in it's up to me consider that i've named it never mind pronouncing it out aloud aleck colored but was grateful without further remark they fell fell and broke the sabbath for that was their only free ten hour stretch it was but another step in the downward path others would follow vast wealth has temptations which fatally and surely undermine the moral structure of persons not habituated to its possession they pulled down the shades and broke the sabbath with hard and patient labor they overhauled their holdings and listed them and a long drawn procession of formidable names it was starting with the railway systems steamer lines standard oil ocean cables diluted telegraph and all the rest and winding up with klondike de beers tammany graft and shady privileges in the post office department twenty four hundred millions and all safely planted in good things gilt edged and interest bearing income 120,000,000 a year aleck fetched a long purr of soft delight and said is it enough it is aleck what shall we do stand pat retire from business that's it i am agreed the good work is finished we will take a long rest and enjoy the money good aleck yes dear how much of the income can we spend the whole of it it seemed to her husband that a ton of chains fell from his limbs he did not say a word he was happy beyond the power of speech after that they broke the sabbaths right along as fast as they turned up it is the first wrong step that counts every sunday they put in the whole day after morning service on inventions inventions of ways to spend the money they got to continuing this delicious dissipation until past midnight and at every seance aleck lavished millions upon great charities and religious enterprises and sally lavished like sums upon matters to which at first he gave definite names only at first later the names gradually lost sharpness of outline and eventually faded into sundries thus becoming entirely but safely undescriptive for sally was crumbling the placing of these millions added seriously and most uncomfortably to the family expenses in tallow candles for a while aleck was worried then after a little she ceased to worry for the occasion of it was gone she was pained she was grieved she was ashamed but she said nothing and so became an accessory sally was taking candles he was robbing the store it is ever thus vast wealth to the person unaccustomed to it is a bane it eats into the flesh and bone of his morals when the fosters were poor they could have been trusted with untold candles but now they but let us not dwell upon it from candles to apples is but a step sally got to taking apples then soap then maple sugar then canned goods then crockery how easy it is to go from bad to worse when once we have started upon a downward course meantime other effects had been milestoning the course of the fosters splendid financial march the fictitious brick dwelling had given place to an imaginary granite one with a checker board mansard roof in time this one disappeared and gave place to a still grander home and so on and so on mansion after mansion made of air rose higher broader finer and each in its turn vanished away until now in these latter great days our dreamers were in fancy housed in a distant region in a sumptuous vast palace which looked out from a leafy summit upon a noble prospect of vale and river and receding hills steeped in tinted mists and all private all the property of the dreamers a palace swarming with liveried servants and populous with guests of fame and power hailing from all the world's capitals foreign and domestic this palace was far far away toward the rising sun immeasurably remote astronomically remote in newport rhode island holy land of high society ineffable domain of the american aristocracy as a rule they spent a part of every sabbath after morning service in this sumptuous home the rest of it they spent in europe or in dawdling around in their private yacht six days of sordid and plodding fact life at home on the ragged edge of lakeside and straitened means the seventh in fairyland such had been their program and their habit in their sternly restricted fact life they remained as of old plodding diligent careful practical economical they stuck loyally to the little presbyterian church and labored faithfully in its interests and stood by its high and tough doctrines with all their mental and spiritual energies but in their dream life they obeyed the invitations of their fancies whatever they might be and howsoever the fancies might change aleck's fancies were not very capricious and not frequent but sally's scattered a good deal aleck in her dream life went over to the episcopal camp on account of its large official titles next she became high church on account of the candles and shows and next she naturally changed to rome where there were cardinals and more candles but these excursions were a nothing to sally's his dream life was a glowing and continuous and persistent excitement and he kept every part of it fresh and sparkling by frequent changes the religious part along with the rest he worked his religions hard and changed them with his shirt the liberal spendings of the fosters upon their fancies began early in their prosperities and grew in prodigality step by step with their advancing fortunes in time they became truly enormous aleck built a university or two per sunday also a hospital or two also a rowton hotel or so also a batch of churches now and then a cathedral and once with untimely and ill chosen playfulness sally said it was a cold day when she didn't ship a cargo of missionaries to persuade unreflecting chinamen to trade off twenty four carat confucianism for counterfeit christianity this rude and unfeeling language hurt aleck to the heart and she went from the presence crying that spectacle went to his own heart and in his pain and shame he would have given worlds to have those unkind words back she had uttered no syllable of reproach and that cut him not one suggestion that he look at his own record and she could have made oh so many and such blistering ones her generous silence brought a swift revenge for it turned his thoughts upon himself it summoned before him a spectral procession a moving vision of his life as he had been leading it these past few years of limitless prosperity and as he sat there reviewing it his cheeks burned and his soul was steeped in humiliation look at her life how fair it was and tending ever upward and look at his own how frivolous how charged with mean vanities how selfish how empty how ignoble and its trend never upward but downward ever downward he instituted comparisons between her record and his own he had found fault with her so he mused _he_ and what could he say for himself when she built her first church what was he doing gathering other blase multimillionaires into a poker club defiling his own palace with it losing hundreds of thousands to it at every sitting and sillily vain of the admiring notoriety it made for him when she was building her first university what was he doing polluting himself with a gay and dissipated secret life in the company of other fast bloods multimillionaires in money and paupers in character when she was building her first foundling asylum what was he doing alas when she was projecting her noble society for the purifying of the sex what was he doing ah what indeed when she and the w c t u and the woman with the hatchet moving with resistless march were sweeping the fatal bottle from the land what was he doing getting drunk three times a day when she builder of a hundred cathedrals was being gratefully welcomed and blest in papal rome and decorated with the golden rose which she had so honorably earned what was he doing breaking the bank at monte carlo he stopped he could go no farther he could not bear the rest he rose up with a great resolution upon his lips this secret life should be revealed and confessed no longer would he live it clandestinely he would go and tell her all and that is what he did he told her all and wept upon her bosom wept and moaned and begged for her forgiveness it was a profound shock and she staggered under the blow but he was her own the core of her heart the blessing of her eyes her all in all she could deny him nothing and she forgave him she felt that he could never again be quite to her what he had been before she knew that he could only repent and not reform yet all morally defaced and decayed as he was was he not her own her very own the idol of her deathless worship she said she was his serf his slave and she opened her yearning heart and took him in chapter vii one sunday afternoon some time after this they were sailing the summer seas in their dream yacht and reclining in lazy luxury under the awning of the after deck there was silence for each was busy with his own thoughts these seasons of silence had insensibly been growing more and more frequent of late the old nearness and cordiality were waning sally's terrible revelation had done its work aleck had tried hard to drive the memory of it out of her mind but it would not go and the shame and bitterness of it were poisoning her gracious dream life she could see now on sundays that her husband was becoming a bloated and repulsive thing she could not close her eyes to this and in these days she no longer looked at him sundays when she could help it but she was she herself without blemish alas she knew she was not she was keeping a secret from him she was acting dishonorably toward him and many a pang it was costing her _she was breaking the compact and concealing it from him_ under strong temptation she had gone into business again she had risked their whole fortune in a purchase of all the railway systems and coal and steel companies in the country on a margin and she was now trembling every sabbath hour lest through some chance word of hers he find it out in her misery and remorse for this treachery she could not keep her heart from going out to him in pity she was filled with compunctions to see him lying there drunk and contented and never suspecting never suspecting trusting her with a perfect and pathetic trust and she holding over him by a thread a possible calamity of so devastating a _say_ aleck the interrupting words brought her suddenly to herself she was grateful to have that persecuting subject from her thoughts and she answered with much of the old time tenderness in her tone yes dear do you know aleck i think we are making a mistake that is you are i mean about the marriage business he sat up fat and froggy and benevolent like a bronze buddha and grew earnest consider it's more than five years you've continued the same policy from the start with every rise always holding on for five points higher always when i think we are going to have some weddings you see a bigger thing ahead and i undergo another disappointment _i_ think you are too hard to please some day we'll get left first we turned down the dentist and the lawyer that was all right it was sound next we turned down the banker's son and the pork butcher's heir right again and sound next we turned down the congressman's son and the governor's right as a trivet i confess it next the senator's son and the son of the vice president of the united states perfectly right there's no permanency about those little distinctions then you went for the aristocracy and i thought we had struck oil at last yes we would make a plunge at the four hundred and pull in some ancient lineage venerable holy ineffable mellow with the antiquity of a hundred and fifty years disinfected of the ancestral odors of salt cod and pelts all of a century ago and unsmirched by a day's work since and then why then the marriages of course but no along comes a pair of real aristocrats from europe and straightway you throw over the half breeds it was awfully discouraging aleck since then what a procession you turned down the baronets for a pair of barons you turned down the barons for a pair of viscounts the viscounts for a pair of earls the earls for a pair of marquises the marquises for a brace of dukes _now_ aleck cash in you've played the limit you've got a job lot of four dukes under the hammer of four nationalities all sound in the wind and limb and pedigree all bankrupt and in debt up to the ears they come high but we can afford it come aleck don't delay any longer don't keep up the suspense take the whole lay out and leave the girls to choose aleck had been smiling blandly and contentedly all through this arraignment of her marriage policy a pleasant light as of triumph with perhaps a nice surprise peeping out through it rose in her eyes and she said as calmly as she could sally what would you say to _royalty_ prodigious poor man it knocked him silly and he fell over the garboard strake and barked his shin on the cat heads he was dizzy for a moment then he gathered himself up and limped over and sat down by his wife and beamed his old time admiration and affection upon her in floods out of his bleary eyes by george he said fervently aleck you _are _great the greatest woman in the whole earth i can't ever learn the whole size of you i can't ever learn the immeasurable deeps of you here i've been considering myself qualified to criticize your game _i why if i had stopped to think i'd have known you had a lone hand up your sleeve now dear heart i'm all red hot impatience tell me about it the flattered and happy woman put her lips to his ear and whispered a princely name it made him catch his breath it lit his face with exultation land he said it's a stunning catch he's got a gambling hall and a graveyard and a bishop and a cathedral all his very own and all gilt edged five hundred per cent stock every detail of it the tidiest little property in europe and that graveyard it's the selectest in the world none but suicides admitted _yes_ sir and the free list suspended too _all _the time there isn't much land in the principality but there's enough eight hundred acres in the graveyard and forty two outside it's a _sovereignty_ that's the main thing _land's_ nothing there's plenty land sahara's drugged with it aleck glowed she was profoundly happy she said think of it sally it is a family that has never married outside the royal and imperial houses of europe our grandchildren will sit upon thrones true as you live aleck and bear scepters too and handle them as naturally and nonchantly as i handle a yardstick it's a grand catch aleck he's corralled is he can't get away you didn't take him on a margin no trust me for that he's not a liability he's an asset so is the other one who is it aleck his royal highness sigismund siegfried lauenfeld dinkelspiel schwartzenberg blutwurst hereditary grand duke of katzenyammer no you can't mean it it's as true as i'm sitting here i give you my word she answered his cup was full and he hugged her to his heart with rapture saying how wonderful it all seems and how beautiful it's one of the oldest and noblest of the three hundred and sixty four ancient german principalities and one of the few that was allowed to retain its royal estate when bismarck got done trimming them i know that farm i've been there it's got a rope walk and a candle factory and an army standing army infantry and cavalry three soldier and a horse aleck it's been a long wait and full of heartbreak and hope deferred but god knows i am happy now happy and grateful to you my own who have done it all when is it to be next sunday good and we'll want to do these weddings up in the very regalest style that's going it's properly due to the royal quality of the parties of the first part now as i understand it there is only one kind of marriage that is sacred to royalty exclusive to royalty it's the morganatic what do they call it that for sally i don't know but anyway it's royal and royal only then we will insist upon it more i will compel it it is morganatic marriage or none that settles it said sally rubbing his hands with delight and it will be the very first in america aleck it will make newport sick then they fell silent and drifted away upon their dream wings to the far regions of the earth to invite all the crowned heads and their families and provide gratis transportation to them chapter viii during three days the couple walked upon air with their heads in the clouds they were but vaguely conscious of their surroundings they saw all things dimly as through a veil they were steeped in dreams often they did not hear when they were spoken to they often did not understand when they heard they answered confusedly or at random sally sold molasses by weight sugar by the yard and furnished soap when asked for candles and aleck put the cat in the wash and fed milk"
