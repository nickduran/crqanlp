"1" "to garrison the moat house but to escort the priest across the wood in the meantime as bennet was to remain behind the command of the reinforcement was given to master shelton indeed there was no choice the men were loutish fellows dull and unskilled in war while dick was not only popular but resolute and grave beyond his age although his youth had been spent in these rough country places the lad had been well taught in letters by sir oliver and hatch himself had shown him the management of arms and the first principles of command bennet had always been kind and helpful he was one of those who are cruel as the grave to those they call their enemies but ruggedly faithful and well willing to their friends and now while sir oliver entered the next house to write in his swift exquisite penmanship a memorandum of the last occurrences to his master sir daniel brackley bennet came up to his pupil to wish him god speed upon his enterprise ye must go the long way about master shelton he said round by the bridge for your life keep a sure man fifty paces afore you to draw shots and go softly till y are past the wood if the rogues fall upon you ride for t ye will do naught by standing and keep ever forward master shelton turn me not back again an ye love your life there is no help in tunstall mind ye that and now since ye go to the great wars about the king and i continue to dwell here in extreme jeopardy of my life and the saints alone can certify if we shall meet again below i give you my last counsels now at your riding keep an eye on sir daniel he is unsure put not your trust in the jack priest he intendeth not amiss but doth the will of others it is a hand gun for sir daniel get your good lordship where ye go make you strong friends look to it and think ever a pater noster while on bennet hatch there are worse rogues afoot than bennet so god speed and heaven be with you bennet returned dick ye were a good friend to me ward and so i shall say ever and look ye master added hatch with a certain embarrassment if this amend all should get a shaft into me ye might mayhap lay out a gold mark or mayhap a pound for my poor soul for it is like to go stiff with me in purgatory ye shall have your will of it bennet answered dick but what cheer man we shall meet again where ye shall have more need of ale than masses the saints so grant it master dick returned the other but here comes sir oliver an he were as quick with the long bow as with the pen he would be a brave man at arms sir oliver gave dick a sealed packet with this superscription to my ryght worchypful master sir daniel brackley knyght be thys delyvered in haste and dick putting it in the bosom of his jacket gave the word and set forth westward up the village book i the two lads chapter i at the sign of the sun in kettley sir daniel and his men lay in and about kettley that night warmly quartered and well patrolled but the knight of tunstall was one who never rested from money getting and even now when he was on the brink of an adventure which should make or mar him he was up an hour after midnight to squeeze poor neighbours he was one who trafficked greatly in disputed inheritances it was his way to buy out the most unlikely claimant and then by the favour he curried with great lords about the king procure unjust decisions in his favour or if that was too roundabout to seize the disputed manor by force of arms and rely on his influence and sir oliver's cunning in the law to hold what he had snatched kettley was one such place it had come very lately into his clutches he still met with opposition from the tenants and it was to overawe discontent that he had led his troops that way by two in the morning sir daniel sat in the inn room close by the fireside for it was cold at that hour among the fens of kettley by his elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale he had taken off his visored headpiece and sat with his bald head and thin dark visage resting on one hand wrapped warmly in a sanguine coloured cloak at the lower end of the room about a dozen of his men stood sentry over the door or lay asleep on benches and somewhat nearer hand a young lad apparently of twelve or thirteen was stretched in a mantle on the floor the host of the sun stood before the great man now mark me mine host sir daniel said follow but mine orders and i shall be your good lord ever i must have good men for head boroughs and i will have adam a more high constable see to it narrowly if other men be chosen it shall avail you nothing rather it shall be found to your sore cost for those that have paid rent to walsingham i shall take good measure you among the rest mine host good knight said the host i will swear upon the cross of holywood i did but pay to walsingham upon compulsion nay bully knight i love not the rogue walsinghams they were as poor as thieves bully knight give me a great lord like you nay ask me among the neighbours i am stout for brackley it may be said sir daniel dryly ye shall then pay twice the innkeeper made a horrid grimace but this was a piece of bad luck that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly times and he was perhaps glad to make his peace so easily bring up yon fellow selden cried the knight and one of his retainers led up a poor cringing old man as pale as a candle and all shaking with the fen fever sirrah said sir daniel your name an't please your worship replied the man my name is condall condall of shoreby at your good worship's pleasure i have heard you ill reported on returned the knight ye deal in treason rogue ye trudge the country leasing y are heavily suspicioned of the death of severals how fellow are ye so bold but i will bring you down right honourable and my reverend lord the man cried here is some hodge podge saving your good presence i am but a poor private man and have hurt none the under sheriff did report of you most vilely said the knight seize me saith he that tyndal of shoreby condall my good lord condall is my poor name said the unfortunate condall or tyndal it is all one replied sir daniel coolly for by my sooth y are here and i do mightily suspect your honesty if ye would save your neck write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound for twenty pound my good lord cried condall here is midsummer madness my whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings condall or tyndal returned sir daniel grinning i will run my peril of that loss write me down twenty and when i have recovered all i may i will be good lord to you and pardon you the rest alas my good lord it may not be i have no skill to write said condall well a day returned the knight here then is no remedy yet i would fain have spared you tyndal had my conscience suffered selden take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm and hang me him tenderly by the neck where i may see him at my riding fare ye well good master condall dear master tyndal y are post haste for paradise fare ye then well nay my right pleasant lord replied condall forcing an obsequious smile an ye be so masterful as doth right well become you i will even with all my poor skill do your good bidding friend quoth sir daniel ye will now write two score go to y are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings selden see him write me this in good form and have it duly witnessed and sir daniel who was a very merry knight none merrier in england took a drink of his mulled ale and lay back smiling meanwhile the boy upon the floor began to stir and presently sat up and looked about him with a scare hither said sir daniel and as the other rose at his command and came slowly towards him he leaned back and laughed outright by the rood he cried a sturdy boy the lad flushed crimson with anger and darted a look of hate out of his dark eyes now that he was on his legs it was more difficult to make certain of his age his face looked somewhat older in expression but it was as smooth as a young child's and in bone and body he was unusually slender and somewhat awkward of gait ye have called me sir daniel he said was it to laugh at my poor plight nay now let laugh said the knight good shrew let laugh i pray you an ye could see yourself i warrant ye would laugh the first well cried the lad flushing ye shall answer this when ye answer for the other laugh while yet ye may nay now good cousin replied sir daniel with some earnestness think not that i mock at you except in mirth as between kinsfolk and singular friends i will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds go to and cherish you exceedingly i took you indeed roughly as the time demanded but from henceforth i shall ungrudgingly maintain and cheerfully serve you ye shall be mrs shelton lady shelton by my troth for the lad promiseth bravely tut ye will not shy for honest laughter it purgeth melancholy they are no rogues who laugh good cousin good mine host lay me a meal now for my cousin master john sit ye down sweetheart and eat nay said master john i will break no bread since ye force me to this sin i will fast for my soul's interest but good mine host i pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water i shall be much beholden to your courtesy indeed ye shall have a dispensation go to cried the knight shalt be well shriven by my faith content you then and eat but the lad was obstinate drank a cup of water and once more wrapping himself closely in his mantle sat in a far corner brooding in an hour or two there rose a stir in the village of sentries challenging and the clatter of arms and horses and then a troop drew up by the inn door and richard shelton splashed with mud presented himself upon the threshold save you sir daniel he said how dickie shelton cried the knight and at the mention of dick's name the other lad looked curiously across what maketh bennet hatch please you sir knight to take cognisance of this packet from sir oliver wherein are all things fully stated answered richard presenting the priest's letter and please you farther ye were best make all speed to risingham for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously with letters and by his report my lord of risingham was sore bested and lacked exceedingly your presence how say you sore bested returned the knight nay then we will make speed sitting down good richard as the world goes in this poor realm of england he that rides softliest rides surest delay they say begetteth peril but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men mark it dick but let me see first what cattle ye have brought selden a link here at the door and sir daniel strode forth into the village street and by the red glow of a torch inspected his new troops he was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master but as a leader in war he was well beloved by those who rode behind his pennant his dash his proved courage his forethought for the soldiers comfort even his rough gibes were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet nay by the rood he cried what poor dogs are these here be some as crooked as a bow and some as lean as a spear friends ye shall ride in the front of the battle i can spare you friends mark me this old villain on the piebald a two year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly ha clipsby are ye there old rat y are a man i could lose with a good heart ye shall go in front of all with a bull's eye painted on your jack to be the better butt for archery sirrah ye shall show me the way i will show you any way sir daniel but the way to change sides returned clipsby sturdily sir daniel laughed a guffaw why well said he cried hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth go to i will forgive you for that merry word selden see them fed both man and brute the knight re entered the inn now friend dick he said fall to here is good ale and bacon eat while that i read sir daniel opened the packet and as he read his brow darkened when he had done he sat a little musing then he looked sharply at his ward dick said he y have seen this penny rhyme the lad replied in the affirmative it bears your father's name continued the knight and our poor shrew of a parson is by some mad soul accused of slaying him he did most eagerly deny it answered dick he did cried the knight very sharply heed him not he has a loose tongue he babbles like a jack sparrow some day when i may find the leisure dick i will myself more fully inform you of these matters there was one duckworth shrewdly blamed for it but the times were troubled and there was no justice to be got it befell at the moat house dick ventured with a beating at his heart it befell between the moat house and holywood replied sir daniel calmly but he shot a covert glance black with suspicion at dick's face and now added the knight speed you with your meal ye shall return to tunstall with a line from me dick's face fell sorely prithee sir daniel he cried send one of the villains i beseech you let me to the battle i can strike a stroke i promise you i misdoubt it not replied sir daniel sitting down to write but here dick is no honour to be won i lie in kettley till i have sure tidings of the war and then ride to join me with the conqueror cry not on cowardice it is but wisdom dick for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion and the king's name and custody so changeth hands that no man may be certain of the morrow toss pot and shuttle wit run in but my lord good counsel sits o one side waiting with that sir daniel turning his back to dick and quite at the farther end of the long table began to write his letter with his mouth on one side for this business of the black arrow stuck sorely in his throat meanwhile young shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast when he felt a touch upon his arm and a very soft voice whispering in his ear make not a sign i do beseech you said the voice but of your charity tell me the straight way to holywood beseech you now good boy comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose take the path by the windmill answered dick in the same tone it will bring you to till ferry there inquire again and without turning his head he fell again to eating but with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called master john stealthily creeping from the room why thought dick he is a young as i good boy doth he call me an i had known i should have seen the varlet hanged ere i had told him well if he goes through the fen i may come up with him and pull his ears half an hour later sir daniel gave dick the letter and bade him speed to the moat house and again some half an hour after dick's departure a messenger came in hot haste from my lord of risingham sir daniel the messenger said ye lose great honour by my sooth the fight began again this morning ere the dawn and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing only the main battle standeth fast an we had your fresh men we should tilt you them all into the river what sir knight will ye be the last it stands not with your good credit nay cried the knight i was but now upon the march selden sound me the tucket sir i am with you on the instant it is not two hours since the more part of my command came in sir messenger what would ye have spurring is good meat but yet it killed the charger bustle boys by this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning and from all sides sir daniel's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn they had slept upon their arms with chargers saddled and in ten minutes five score men at arms and archers cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined stood ranked and ready the chief part were in sir daniel's livery murrey and blue which gave the greater show to their array the best armed rode first and away out of sight at the tail of the column came the sorry reinforcement of the night before sir daniel looked with pride along the line here be the lads to serve you in a pinch he said they are pretty men indeed replied the messenger it but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier well said the knight what would ye the beginning of a feast and the end of a fray sir messenger and he mounted into his saddle why how now he cried john joanna nay by the sacred rood where is she host where is that girl girl sir daniel cried the landlord nay sir i saw no girl boy then dotard cried the knight could ye not see it was a wench she in the murrey coloured mantle she that broke her fast with water rogue where is she nay the saints bless us master john ye called him said the host well i thought none evil he is gone i saw him her i saw her in the stable a good hour agone a was saddling a grey horse now by the rood cried sir daniel the wench was worth five hundred pound to me and more sir knight observed the messenger with bitterness while that ye are here roaring for five hundred pounds the realm of england is elsewhere being lost and won it is well said replied sir daniel selden fall me out with six cross bowmen hunt me her down i care not what it cost but at my returning let me find her at the moat house be it upon your head and now sir messenger we march and the troop broke into a good trot and selden and his six men were left behind upon the street of kettley with the staring villagers chapter ii in the fen it was near six in the may morning when dick began to ride down into the fen upon his homeward way the sky was all blue the jolly wind blew loud and steady the windmill sails were spinning and the willows over all the fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn he had been all night in the saddle but his heart was good and his body sound and he rode right merrily the path went down and down into the marsh till he lost sight of all the neighbouring landmarks but kettley windmill on the knoll behind him and the extreme top of tunstall forest far before on either hand there were great fields of blowing reeds and willows pools of water shaking in the wind and treacherous bogs as green as emerald to tempt and to betray the traveller the path lay almost straight through the morass it was already very ancient its foundation had been laid by roman soldiery in the lapse of ages much of it had sunk and every here and there for a few hundred yards it lay submerged below the stagnant waters of the fen about a mile from kettley dick came to one such break in the plain line of causeway where the reeds and willows grew dispersedly like little islands and confused the eye the gap besides was more than usually long it was a place where any stranger might come readily to mischief and dick bethought him with something like a pang of the lad whom he had so imperfectly directed as for himself one look backward to where the windmill sails were turning black against the blue of heaven one look forward to the high ground of tunstall forest and he was sufficiently directed and held straight on the water washing to his horse's knees as safe as on a highway half way across and when he had already sighted the path rising high and dry upon the farther side he was aware of a great splashing on his right and saw a grey horse sunk to its belly in the mud and still spasmodically struggling instantly as though it had divined the neighbourhood of help the poor beast began to neigh most piercingly it rolled meanwhile a blood shot eye insane with terror and as it sprawled wallowing in the quag clouds of stinging insects rose and buzzed about it in the air alack thought dick can the poor lad have perished there is his horse for certain a brave grey nay comrade if thou criest to me so piteously i will do all man can to help thee shalt not lie there to drown by inches and he made ready his crossbow and put a quarrel through the creature's head dick rode on after this act of rugged mercy somewhat sobered in spirit and looking closely about him for any sign of his less happy predecessor in the way i would i had dared to tell him further he thought for i fear he has miscarried in the slough and just as he was so thinking a voice cried upon his name from the causeway side and looking over his shoulder he saw the lad's face peering from a clump of reeds are ye there he said reining in ye lay so close among the reeds that i had passed you by i saw your horse bemired and put him from his agony which by my sooth an ye had been a more merciful rider ye had done yourself but come forth out of your hiding here be none to trouble you nay good boy i have no arms nor skill to use them if i had replied the other stepping forth upon the pathway why call me boy cried dick y are not i trow the elder of us twain good master shelton said the other prithee forgive me i have none the least intention to offend rather i would in every way beseech your gentleness and favour for i am now worse bested than ever having lost my way my cloak and my poor horse to have a riding rod and spurs and never a horse to sit upon and before all he added looking ruefully upon his clothes before all to be so sorrily besmirched tut cried dick would ye mind a ducking blood of wound or dust of travel that's a man's adornment nay then i like him better plain observed the lad but prithee how shall i do prithee good master richard help me with your good counsel if i come not safe to holywood i am undone nay said dick dismounting i will give more than counsel take my horse and i will run awhile and when i am weary we shall change again that so riding and running both may go the speedier so the change was made and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway dick with his hand upon the other's knee how call ye your name asked dick call me john matcham replied the lad and what make ye to holywood dick continued i seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me was the answer the good abbot of holywood is a strong pillar to the weak and how came ye with sir daniel master matcham pursued dick nay cried the other by the abuse of force he hath taken me by violence from my own place dressed me in these weeds ridden with me till my heart was sick gibed me till i could a wept and when certain of my friends pursued thinking to have me back claps me in the rear to stand their shot i was even grazed in the right foot and walk but lamely nay there shall come a day between us he shall smart for all would ye shoot at the moon with a hand gun said dick tis a valiant knight and hath a hand of iron an he guessed i had made or meddled with your flight it would go sore with me ay poor boy returned the other y are his ward i know it by the same token so am i or so he saith or else he hath bought my marriage i wot not rightly which but it is some handle to oppress me by boy again said dick nay then shall i call you girl good richard asked matcham never a girl for me returned dick i do abjure the crew of them ye speak boyishly said the other ye think more of them than ye pretend not i said dick stoutly they come not in my mind a plague of them say i give me to hunt and to fight and to feast and to live with jolly foresters i never heard of a maid yet that was for any service save one only and she poor shrew was burned for a witch and the wearing of men's clothes in spite of nature master matcham crossed himself with fervour and appeared to pray what make ye dick inquired i pray for her spirit answered the other with a somewhat troubled voice for a witch's spirit dick cried but pray for her an ye list she was the best wench in europe was this joan of arc old appleyard the archer ran from her he said as if she had been mahoun nay she was a brave wench well but good master richard resumed matcham an ye like maids so little y are no true natural man for god made them twain by intention and brought true love into the world to be man's hope and woman's comfort faugh said dick y are a milk sopping baby so to harp on women an ye think i be no true man get down upon the path and whether at fists back sword or bow and arrow i will prove my manhood on your body nay i am no fighter said matcham eagerly i mean no tittle of offence i meant but pleasantry and if i talk of women it is because i heard ye were to marry i to marry dick exclaimed well it is the first i hear of it and with whom was i to marry one joan sedley replied matcham colouring it was sir daniel's doing he hath money to gain upon both sides and indeed i have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match it seems she is of your mind or else distasted to the bridegroom well marriage is like death it comes to all said dick with resignation and she bemoaned herself i pray ye now see there how shuttle witted are these girls to bemoan herself before that she had seen me do i bemoan myself not i an i be to marry i will marry dry eyed but if ye know her prithee of what favour is she fair or foul and is she shrewish or pleasant nay what matters it said matcham an y are to marry ye can but marry what matters foul or fair these be but toys y are no milksop master richard ye will wed with dry eyes anyhow it is well said replied shelton little i reck your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord said matcham she shall have the lord heaven made her for returned dick it trow there be worse as well as better ah the poor wench cried"
