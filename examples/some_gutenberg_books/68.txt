"1" "are able to go for incredible periods without nourishment nor did i suffer the water of the river was sweet and cold for it was unpolluted by decaying bodies like the iss and as for food why the mere thought that i was nearing my beloved princess raised me above every material want as i proceeded the river became narrower and the current swift and turbulent so swift in fact that it was with difficulty that i forced my craft upward at all i could not have been making to exceed a hundred yards an hour when at a bend i was confronted by a series of rapids through which the river foamed and boiled at a terrific rate my heart sank within me the sorapus nutshell had proved a false prophet and after all my intuition had been correct it was the left hand channel that i should have followed had i been a woman i should have wept at my right was a great slow moving eddy that circled far beneath the cliff's overhanging side and to rest my tired muscles before turning back i let my boat drift into its embrace i was almost prostrated by disappointment it would mean another half day's loss of time to retrace my way and take the only passage that yet remained unexplored what hellish fate had led me to select from three possible avenues the two that were wrong as the lazy current of the eddy carried me slowly about the periphery of the watery circle my boat twice touched the rocky side of the river in the dark recess beneath the cliff a third time it struck gently as it had before but the contact resulted in a different sound the sound of wood scraping upon wood in an instant i was on the alert for there could be no wood within that buried river that had not been man brought almost coincidentally with my first apprehension of the noise my hand shot out across the boat's side and a second later i felt my fingers gripping the gunwale of another craft as though turned to stone i sat in tense and rigid silence straining my eyes into the utter darkness before me in an effort to discover if the boat were occupied it was entirely possible that there might be men on board it who were still ignorant of my presence for the boat was scraping gently against the rocks upon one side so that the gentle touch of my boat upon the other easily could have gone unnoticed peer as i would i could not penetrate the darkness and then i listened intently for the sound of breathing near me but except for the noise of the rapids the soft scraping of the boats and the lapping of the water at their sides i could distinguish no sound as usual i thought rapidly a rope lay coiled in the bottom of my own craft very softly i gathered it up and making one end fast to the bronze ring in the prow i stepped gingerly into the boat beside me in one hand i grasped the rope in the other my keen long sword for a full minute perhaps i stood motionless after entering the strange craft it had rocked a trifle beneath my weight but it had been the scraping of its side against the side of my own boat that had seemed most likely to alarm its occupants if there were any but there was no answering sound and a moment later i had felt from stem to stern and found the boat deserted groping with my hands along the face of the rocks to which the craft was moored i discovered a narrow ledge which i knew must be the avenue taken by those who had come before me that they could be none other than thurid and his party i was convinced by the size and build of the boat i had found calling to woola to follow me i stepped out upon the ledge the great savage brute agile as a cat crept after me as he passed through the boat that had been occupied by thurid and the therns he emitted a single low growl and when he came beside me upon the ledge and my hand rested upon his neck i felt his short mane bristling with anger i think he sensed telepathically the recent presence of an enemy for i had made no effort to impart to him the nature of our quest or the status of those we tracked this omission i now made haste to correct and after the manner of green martians with their beasts i let him know partially by the weird and uncanny telepathy of barsoom and partly by word of mouth that we were upon the trail of those who had recently occupied the boat through which we had just passed a soft purr like that of a great cat indicated that woola understood and then with a word to him to follow i turned to the right along the ledge but scarcely had i done so than i felt his mighty fangs tugging at my leathern harness as i turned to discover the cause of his act he continued to pull me steadily in the opposite direction nor would he desist until i had turned about and indicated that i would follow him voluntarily never had i known him to be in error in a matter of tracking so it was with a feeling of entire security that i moved cautiously in the huge beast's wake through cimmerian darkness he moved along the narrow ledge beside the boiling rapids as we advanced the way led from beneath the overhanging cliffs out into a dim light and then it was that i saw that the trail had been cut from the living rock and that it ran up along the river's side beyond the rapids for hours we followed the dark and gloomy river farther and farther into the bowels of mars from the direction and distance i knew that we must be well beneath the valley dor and possibly beneath the sea of omean as well it could not be much farther now to the temple of the sun even as my mind framed the thought woola halted suddenly before a narrow arched doorway in the cliff by the trail's side quickly he crouched back away from the entrance at the same time turning his eyes toward me words could not have more plainly told me that danger of some sort lay near by and so i pressed quietly forward to his side and passing him looked into the aperture at our right before me was a fair sized chamber that from its appointments i knew must have at one time been a guardroom there were racks for weapons and slightly raised platforms for the sleeping silks and furs of the warriors but now its only occupants were two of the therns who had been of the party with thurid and matai shang the men were in earnest conversation and from their tones it was apparent that they were entirely unaware that they had listeners i tell you one of them was saying i do not trust the black one there was no necessity for leaving us here to guard the way against what pray should we guard this long forgotten abysmal path it was but a ruse to divide our numbers he will have matai shang leave others elsewhere on some pretext or other and then at last he will fall upon us with his confederates and slay us all i believe you lakor replied the other there can never be aught else than deadly hatred between thern and first born and what think you of the ridiculous matter of the light let the light shine with the intensity of three radium units for fifty tals and for one xat let it shine with the intensity of one radium unit and then for twenty five tals with nine units those were his very words and to think that wise old matai shang should listen to such foolishness indeed it is silly replied lakor it will open nothing other than the way to a quick death for us all he had to make some answer when matai shang asked him flatly what he should do when he came to the temple of the sun and so he made his answer quickly from his imagination i would wager a hekkador's diadem that he could not now repeat it himself let us not remain here longer lakor spoke the other thern perchance if we hasten after them we may come in time to rescue matai shang and wreak our own vengeance upon the black dator what say you never in a long life answered lakor have i disobeyed a single command of the father of therns i shall stay here until i rot if he does not return to bid me elsewhere lakor's companion shook his head you are my superior he said i cannot do other than you sanction though i still believe that we are foolish to remain i too thought that they were foolish to remain for i saw from woola's actions that the trail led through the room where the two therns held guard i had no reason to harbor any considerable love for this race of self deified demons yet i would have passed them by were it possible without molesting them it was worth trying anyway for a fight might delay us considerably or even put an end entirely to my search better men than i have gone down before fighters of meaner ability than that possessed by the fierce thern warriors signaling woola to heel i stepped suddenly into the room before the two men at sight of me their long swords flashed from the harness at their sides but i raised my hand in a gesture of restraint i seek thurid the black dator i said my quarrel is with him not with you let me pass then in peace for if i mistake not he is as much your enemy as mine and you can have no cause to protect him they lowered their swords and lakor spoke i know not whom you may be with the white skin of a thern and the black hair of a red man but were it only thurid whose safety were at stake you might pass and welcome in so far as we be concerned tell us who you be and what mission calls you to this unknown world beneath the valley dor then maybe we can see our way to let you pass upon the errand which we should like to undertake would our orders permit i was surprised that neither of them had recognized me for i thought that i was quite sufficiently well known either by personal experience or reputation to every thern upon barsoom as to make my identity immediately apparent in any part of the planet in fact i was the only white man upon mars whose hair was black and whose eyes were gray with the exception of my son carthoris to reveal my identity might be to precipitate an attack for every thern upon barsoom knew that to me they owed the fall of their age old spiritual supremacy on the other hand my reputation as a fighting man might be sufficient to pass me by these two were their livers not of the right complexion to welcome a battle to the death to be quite candid i did not attempt to delude myself with any such sophistry since i knew well that upon war like mars there are few cowards and that every man whether prince priest or peasant glories in deadly strife and so i gripped my long sword the tighter as i replied to lakor i believe that you will see the wisdom of permitting me to pass unmolested i said for it would avail you nothing to die uselessly in the rocky bowels of barsoom merely to protect a hereditary enemy such as thurid dator of the first born that you shall die should you elect to oppose me is evidenced by the moldering corpses of all the many great barsoomian warriors who have gone down beneath this blade i am john carter prince of helium for a moment that name seemed to paralyze the two men but only for a moment and then the younger of them with a vile name upon his lips rushed toward me with ready sword he had been standing a little behind his companion lakor during our parley and now ere he could engage me the older man grasped his harness and drew him back hold commanded lakor there will be plenty of time to fight if we find it wise to fight at all there be good reasons why every thern upon barsoom should yearn to spill the blood of the blasphemer the sacrilegist but let us mix wisdom with our righteous hate the prince of helium is bound upon an errand which we ourselves but a moment since were wishing that we might undertake let him go then and slay the black when he returns we shall still be here to bar his way to the outer world and thus we shall have rid ourselves of two enemies nor have incurred the displeasure of the father of therns as he spoke i could not but note the crafty glint in his evil eyes and while i saw the apparent logic of his reasoning i felt subconsciously perhaps that his words did but veil some sinister intent the other thern turned toward him in evident surprise but when lakor had whispered a few brief words into his ear he too drew back and nodded acquiescence to his superior's suggestion proceed john carter said lakor but know that if thurid does not lay you low there will be those awaiting your return who will see that you never pass again into the sunlight of the upper world go during our conversation woola had been growling and bristling close to my side occasionally he would look up into my face with a low pleading whine as though begging for the word that would send him headlong at the bare throats before him he too sensed the villainy behind the smooth words beyond the therns several doorways opened off the guardroom and toward the one upon the extreme right lakor motioned that way leads to thurid he said but when i would have called woola to follow me there the beast whined and held back and at last ran quickly to the first opening at the left where he stood emitting his coughing bark as though urging me to follow him upon the right way i turned a questioning look upon lakor the brute is seldom wrong i said and while i do not doubt your superior knowledge thern i think that i shall do well to listen to the voice of instinct that is backed by love and loyalty as i spoke i smiled grimly that he might know without words that i distrusted him as you will the fellow replied with a shrug in the end it shall be all the same i turned and followed woola into the left hand passage and though my back was toward my enemies my ears were on the alert yet i heard no sound of pursuit the passageway was dimly lighted by occasional radium bulbs the universal lighting medium of barsoom these same lamps may have been doing continuous duty in these subterranean chambers for ages since they require no attention and are so compounded that they give off but the minutest of their substance in the generation of years of luminosity we had proceeded for but a short distance when we commenced to pass the mouths of diverging corridors but not once did woola hesitate it was at the opening to one of these corridors upon my right that i presently heard a sound that spoke more plainly to john carter fighting man than could the words of my mother tongue it was the clank of metal the metal of a warrior's harness and it came from a little distance up the corridor upon my right woola heard it too and like a flash he had wheeled and stood facing the threatened danger his mane all abristle and all his rows of glistening fangs bared by snarling backdrawn lips with a gesture i silenced him and together we drew aside into another corridor a few paces farther on here we waited nor did we have long to wait for presently we saw the shadows of two men fall upon the floor of the main corridor athwart the doorway of our hiding place very cautiously they were moving now the accidental clank that had alarmed me was not repeated presently they came opposite our station nor was i surprised to see that the two were lakor and his companion of the guardroom they walked very softly and in the right hand of each gleamed a keen long sword they halted quite close to the entrance of our retreat whispering to each other can it be that we have distanced them already said lakor either that or the beast has led the man upon a wrong trail replied the other for the way which we took is by far the shorter to this point for him who knows it john carter would have found it a short road to death had he taken it as you suggested to him yes said lakor no amount of fighting ability would have saved him from the pivoted flagstone he surely would have stepped upon it and by now if the pit beneath it has a bottom which thurid denies he should have been rapidly approaching it curses on that calot of his that warned him toward the safer avenue there be other dangers ahead of him though spoke lakor's fellow which he may not so easily escape should he succeed in escaping our two good swords consider for example what chance he will have coming unexpectedly into the chamber of i would have given much to have heard the balance of that conversation that i might have been warned of the perils that lay ahead but fate intervened and just at the very instant of all other instants that i would not have elected to do it i sneezed the temple of the sun there was nothing for it now other than to fight nor did i have any advantage as i sprang sword in hand into the corridor before the two therns for my untimely sneeze had warned them of my presence and they were ready for me there were no words for they would have been a waste of breath the very presence of the two proclaimed their treachery that they were following to fall upon me unawares was all too plain and they of course must have known that i understood their plan in an instant i was engaged with both and though i loathe the very name of thern i must in all fairness admit that they are mighty swordsmen and these two were no exception unless it were that they were even more skilled and fearless than the average among their race while it lasted it was indeed as joyous a conflict as i ever had experienced twice at least i saved my breast from the mortal thrust of piercing steel only by the wondrous agility with which my earthly muscles endow me under the conditions of lesser gravity and air pressure upon mars yet even so i came near to tasting death that day in the gloomy corridor beneath mars's southern pole for lakor played a trick upon me that in all my experience of fighting upon two planets i never before had witnessed the like of the other thern was engaging me at the time and i was forcing him back touching him here and there with my point until he was bleeding from a dozen wounds yet not being able to penetrate his marvelous guard to reach a vulnerable spot for the brief instant that would have been sufficient to send him to his ancestors it was then that lakor quickly unslung a belt from his harness and as i stepped back to parry a wicked thrust he lashed one end of it about my left ankle so that it wound there for an instant while he jerked suddenly upon the other end throwing me heavily upon my back then like leaping panthers they were upon me but they had reckoned without woola and before ever a blade touched me a roaring embodiment of a thousand demons hurtled above my prostrate form and my loyal martian calot was upon them imagine if you can a huge grizzly with ten legs armed with mighty talons and an enormous froglike mouth splitting his head from ear to ear exposing three rows of long white tusks then endow this creature of your imagination with the agility and ferocity of a half starved bengal tiger and the strength of a span of bulls and you will have some faint conception of woola in action before i could call him off he had crushed lakor into a jelly with a single blow of one mighty paw and had literally torn the other thern to ribbons yet when i spoke to him sharply he cowed sheepishly as though he had done a thing to deserve censure and chastisement never had i had the heart to punish woola during the long years that had passed since that first day upon mars when the green jed of the tharks had placed him on guard over me and i had won his love and loyalty from the cruel and loveless masters of his former life yet i believe he would have submitted to any cruelty that i might have inflicted upon him so wondrous was his affection for me the diadem in the center of the circlet of gold upon the brow of lakor proclaimed him a holy thern while his companion not thus adorned was a lesser thern though from his harness i gleaned that he had reached the ninth cycle which is but one below that of the holy therns as i stood for a moment looking at the gruesome havoc woola had wrought there recurred to me the memory of that other occasion upon which i had masqueraded in the wig diadem and harness of sator throg the holy thern whom thuvia of ptarth had slain and now it occurred to me that it might prove of worth to utilize lakor's trappings for the same purpose a moment later i had torn his yellow wig from his bald pate and transferred it and the circlet as well as all his harness to my own person woola did not approve of the metamorphosis he sniffed at me and growled ominously but when i spoke to him and patted his huge head he at length became reconciled to the change and at my command trotted off along the corridor in the direction we had been going when our progress had been interrupted by the therns we moved cautiously now warned by the fragment of conversation i had overheard i kept abreast of woola that we might have the benefit of all our eyes for what might appear suddenly ahead to menace us and well it was that we were forewarned at the bottom of a flight of narrow steps the corridor turned sharply back upon itself immediately making another turn in the original direction so that at that point it formed a perfect letter s the top leg of which debouched suddenly into a large chamber illy lighted and the floor of which was completely covered by venomous snakes and loathsome reptiles to have attempted to cross that floor would have been to court instant death and for a moment i was almost completely discouraged then it occurred to me that thurid and matai shang with their party must have crossed it and so there was a way had it not been for the fortunate accident by which i overheard even so small a portion of the therns conversation we should have blundered at least a step or two into that wriggling mass of destruction and a single step would have been all sufficient to have sealed our doom these were the only reptiles i had ever seen upon barsoom but i knew from their similarity to the fossilized remains of supposedly extinct species i had seen in the museums of helium that they comprised many of the known prehistoric reptilian genera as well as others undiscovered a more hideous aggregation of monsters had never before assailed my vision it would be futile to attempt to describe them to earth men since substance is the only thing which they possess in common with any creature of the past or present with which you are familiar even their venom is of an unearthly virulence that by comparison would make the cobra de capello seem quite as harmless as an angleworm as they spied me there was a concerted rush by those nearest the entrance where we stood but a line of radium bulbs inset along the threshold of their chamber brought them to a sudden halt evidently they dared not cross that line of light i had been quite sure that they would not venture beyond the room in which i had discovered them though i had not guessed at what deterred them the simple fact that we had found no reptiles in the corridor through which we had just come was sufficient assurance that they did not venture there i drew woola out of harm's way and then began a careful survey of as much of the chamber of reptiles as i could see from where i stood as my eyes became accustomed to the dim light of its interior i gradually made out a low gallery at the far end of the apartment from which opened several exits coming as close to the threshold as i dared i followed this gallery with my eyes discovering that it circled the room as far as i could see then i glanced above me along the upper edge of the entrance to which we had come and there to my delight i saw an end of the gallery not a foot above my head in an instant i had leaped to it and called woola after me here there were no reptiles the way was clear to the opposite side of the hideous chamber and a moment later woola and i dropped down to safety in the corridor beyond not ten minutes later we came into a vast circular apartment of white marble the walls of which were inlaid with gold in the strange hieroglyphics of the first born from the high dome of this mighty apartment a huge circular column extended to the floor and as i watched i saw that it slowly revolved i had reached the base of the temple of the sun somewhere above me lay dejah thoris and with her were phaidor daughter of matai shang and thuvia of ptarth but how to reach them now that i had found the only vulnerable spot in their mighty prison was still a baffling riddle slowly i circled the great shaft looking for a means of ingress part way around i found a tiny radium flash torch and as i examined it in mild curiosity as to its presence there in this almost inaccessible and unknown spot i came suddenly upon the insignia of the house of thurid jewel inset in its metal case i am upon the right trail i thought as i slipped the bauble into the pocket pouch which hung from my harness then i continued my search for the entrance which i knew must be somewhere about nor had i long to search for almost immediately thereafter i came upon a small door so cunningly inlaid in the shaft's base that it might have passed unnoticed by a less keen or careful observer there was the door that would lead me within the prison but where was the means to open it no button or lock were visible again and again i went carefully over every square inch of its surface but the most that i could find was a tiny pinhole a little above and to the right of the door's center a pinhole that seemed only an accident of manufacture or an imperfection of material into this minute aperture i attempted to peer but whether it was but a fraction of an inch deep or passed completely through the door i could not tell at least no light showed beyond it i put my ear to it next and listened but again my efforts brought negligible results during these experiments woola had been standing at my side gazing intently at the door and as my glance fell upon him it occurred to me to test the correctness of my hypothesis that this portal had been the means of ingress to the temple used by thurid the black dator and matai shang father of therns turning away abruptly i called to him to follow me for a moment he hesitated and then leaped after me whining and tugging at my harness to draw me back i walked on however some distance from the door before i let him have his way that i might see precisely what he would do then i permitted"
