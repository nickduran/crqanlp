"1" "the frail river craft had toiled into caillou bay running close to the main shore and now she was heading right for the island with the wind aft over the monstrous sea on she came swaying rocking plunging with a great whiteness wrapping her about like a cloud and moving with her moving a tempest whirl of spray ghost white and like a ghost she came for her smoke stacks exhaled no visible smoke the wind devoured it the excitement on shore became wild men shouted themselves hoarse women laughed and cried every telescope and opera glass was directed upon the coming apparition all wondered how the pilot kept his feet all marvelled at the madness of the captain but captain abraham smith was not mad a veteran american sailor he had learned to know the great gulf as scholars know deep books by heart he knew the birthplace of its tempests the mystery of its tides the omens of its hurricanes while lying at brashear city he felt the storm had not yet reached its highest vaguely foresaw a mighty peril and resolved to wait no longer for a lull boys he said we've got to take her out in spite of hell and they took her out through all the peril his men stayed by him and obeyed him by midmorning the wind had deepened to a roar lowering sometimes to a rumble sometimes bursting upon the ears like a measureless and deafening crash then the captain knew the star was running a race with death she'll win it he muttered she'll stand it perhaps they'll have need of me to night she won with a sonorous steam chant of triumph the brave little vessel rode at last into the bayou and anchored hard by her accustomed resting place in full view of the hotel though not near enough to shore to lower her gang plank but she had sung her swan song gathering in from the northeast the waters of the bay were already marbling over the salines and half across the island and still the wind increased its paroxysmal power cottages began to rock some slid away from the solid props upon which they rested a chimney fumbled shutters were wrenched off verandas demolished light roofs lifted dropped again and flapped into ruin trees bent their heads to the earth and still the storm grew louder and blacker with every passing hour the star rose with the rising of the waters dragging her anchor two more anchors were put out and still she dragged dragged in with the flood twisting shuddering careening in her agony evening fell the sand began to move with the wind stinging faces like a continuous fire of fine shot and frenzied blasts came to buffet the steamer forward sideward then one of her hog chains parted with a clang like the boom of a big bell then another then the captain bade his men to cut away all her upper works clean to the deck overboard into the seething went her stacks her pilot house her cabins and whirled away and the naked hull of the star still dragging her three anchors labored on through the darkness nearer and nearer to the immense silhouette of the hotel whose hundred windows were now all aflame the vast timber building seemed to defy the storm the wind roaring round its broad verandas hissing through every crevice with the sound and force of steam appeared to waste its rage and in the half lull between two terrible gusts there came to the captain's ears a sound that seemed strange in that night of multitudinous terrors a sound of music vi almost every evening throughout the season there had been dancing in the great hall there was dancing that night also the population of the hotel had been augmented by the advent of families from other parts of the island who found their summer cottages insecure places of shelter there were nearly four hundred guests assembled perhaps it was for this reason that the entertainment had been prepared upon a grander plan than usual that it assumed the form of a fashionable ball and all those pleasure seekers representing the wealth and beauty of the creole parishes whether from ascension or assumption st mary's or st landry's iberville or terrebonne whether inhabitants of the multi colored and many balconied creole quarter of the quaint metropolis or dwellers in the dreamy paradises of the teche mingled joyously knowing each other feeling in some sort akin whether affiliated by blood connaturalized by caste or simply interassociated by traditional sympathies of class sentiment and class interest perhaps in the more than ordinary merriment of that evening something of nervous exaltation might have been discerned something like a feverish resolve to oppose apprehension with gayety to combat uneasiness by diversion but the hours passed in mirthfulness the first general feeling of depression began to weigh less and less upon the guests they had found reason to confide in the solidity of the massive building there were no positive terrors no outspoken fears and the new conviction of all had found expression in the words of the host himself il n'y a rien de mieux a faire que de s'amuser of what avail to lament the prospective devastation of cane fields to discuss the possible ruin of crops better to seek solace in choregraphic harmonies in the rhythm of gracious motion and of perfect melody than hearken to the discords of the wild orchestra of storms wiser to admire the grace of parisian toilets the eddy of trailing robes with its fairy foam of lace the ivorine loveliness of glossy shoulders and jewelled throats the glimmering of satin slippered feet than to watch the raging of the flood without or the flying of the wrack so the music and the mirth went on they made joy for themselves those elegant guests they jested and sipped rich wines they pledged and hoped and loved and promised with never a thought of the morrow on the night of the tenth of august eighteen hundred and fifty six observant parents were there planning for the future bliss of their nearest and dearest mothers and fathers of handsome lads lithe and elegant as young pines and fresh from the polish of foreign university training mothers and fathers of splendid girls whose simplest attitudes were witcheries young cheeks flushed young hearts fluttered with an emotion more puissant than the excitement of the dance young eyes betrayed the happy secret discreeter lips would have preserved slave servants circled through the aristocratic press bearing dainties and wines praying permission to pass in terms at once humble and officious always in the excellent french which well trained house servants were taught to use on such occasions night wore on still the shining floor palpitated to the feet of the dancers still the piano forte pealed and still the violins sang and the sound of their singing shrilled through the darkness in gasps of the gale to the ears of captain smith as he strove to keep his footing on the spray drenched deck of the star christ he muttered a dance if that wind whips round south there'll be another dance but i guess the star will stay half an hour might have passed still the lights flamed calmly and the violins trilled and the perfumed whirl went on and suddenly the wind veered again the star reeled and shuddered and turned and began to drag all her anchors but she now dragged away from the great building and its lights away from the voluptuous thunder of the grand piano even at that moment outpouring the great joy of weber's melody orchestrated by berlioz l'invitation a la valse with its marvellous musical swing waltzing cried the captain god help them god help us all now the wind waltzes to night with the sea for his partner o the stupendous valse tourbillon o the mighty dancer one two three from northeast to east from east to southeast from southeast to south then from the south he came whirling the sea in his arms some one shrieked in the midst of the revels some girl who found her pretty slippers wet what could it be thin streams of water were spreading over the level planking curling about the feet of the dancers what could it be all the land had begun to quake even as but a moment before the polished floor was trembling to the pressure of circling steps all the building shook now every beam uttered its groan what could it be there was a clamor a panic a rush to the windy night infinite darkness above and beyond but the lantern beams danced far out over an unbroken circle of heaving and swirling black water stealthily swiftly the measureless sea flood was rising messieurs mesdames ce n'est rien nothing serious ladies i assure you mais nous en avons vu bien souvent les inondations comme celle ci ca passe vite the water will go down in a few hours ladies it never rises higher than this il n'y a pas le moindre danger je vous dis allons il n'y a my god what is that for a moment there was a ghastly hush of voices and through that hush there burst upon the ears of all a fearful and unfamiliar sound as of a colossal cannonade rolling up from the south with volleying lightnings vastly and swiftly nearer and nearer it came a ponderous and unbroken thunder roll terrible as the long muttering of an earthquake the nearest mainland across mad caillou bay to the sea marshes lay twelve miles north west by the gulf the nearest solid ground was twenty miles distant there were boats yes but the stoutest swimmer might never reach them now then rose a frightful cry the hoarse hideous indescribable cry of hopeless fear the despairing animal cry man utters when suddenly brought face to face with nothingness without preparation without consolation without possibility of respite sauve qui peut some wrenched down the doors some clung to the heavy banquet tables to the sofas to the billiard tables during one terrible instant against fruitless heroisms against futile generosities raged all the frenzy of selfishness all the brutalities of panic and then then came thundering through the blackness the giant swells boom on boom one crash the huge frame building rocks like a cradle seesaws crackles what are human shrieks now the tornado is shrieking another chandeliers splinter lights are dashed out a sweeping cataract hurls in the immense hall rises oscillates twirls as upon a pivot crepitates crumbles into ruin crash again the swirling wreck dissolves into the wallowing of another monster billow and a hundred cottages overturn spin in sudden eddies quiver disjoint and melt into the seething so the hurricane passed tearing off the heads of the prodigious waves to hurl them a hundred feet in air heaping up the ocean against the land upturning the woods bays and passes were swollen to abysses rivers regorged the sea marshes were changed to raging wastes of water before new orleans the flood of the mile broad mississippi rose six feet above highest water mark one hundred and ten miles away donaldsonville trembled at the towering tide of the lafourche lakes strove to burst their boundaries far off river steamers tugged wildly at their cables shivering like tethered creatures that hear by night the approaching howl of destroyers smoke stacks were hurled overboard pilot houses torn away cabins blown to fragments and over roaring kaimbuck pass over the agony of caillou bay the billowing tide rushed unresisted from the gulf tearing and swallowing the land in its course ploughing out deep sea channels where sleek herds had been grazing but a few hours before rending islands in twain and ever bearing with it through the night enormous vortex of wreck and vast wan drift of corpses but the star remained and captain abraham smith with a long good rope about his waist dashed again and again into that awful surging to snatch victims from death clutching at passing hands heads garments in the cataract sweep of the seas saving aiding cheering though blinded by spray and battered by drifting wreck until his strength failed in the unequal struggle at last and his men drew him aboard senseless with some beautiful half drowned girl safe in his arms but well nigh twoscore souls had been rescued by him and the star stayed on through it all long years after the weed grown ribs of her graceful skeleton could still be seen curving up from the sand dunes of last island in valiant witness of how well she stayed vii day breaks through the flying wrack over the infinite heaving of the sea over the low land made vast with desolation it is a spectral dawn a wan light like the light of a dying sun the wind has waned and veered the flood sinks slowly back to its abysses abandoning its plunder scattering its piteous waifs over bar and dune over shoal and marsh among the silences of the mango swamps over the long low reaches of sand grasses and drowned weeds for more than a hundred miles from the shell reefs of pointe au fer to the shallows of pelto bay the dead lie mingled with the high heaped drift from their cypress groves the vultures rise to dispute a share of the feast with the shrieking frigate birds and squeaking gulls and as the tremendous tide withdraws its plunging waters all the pirates of air follow the great white gleaming retreat a storm of billowing wings and screaming throats and swift in the wake of gull and frigate bird the wreckers come the spoilers of the dead savage skimmers of the sea hurricane riders wont to spread their canvas pinions in the face of storms sicilian and corsican outlaws manila

complicated for your peon fingers tear them out dispense chulita suddenly a long mighty silver trilling fills the ears of all there is a wild hurrying and scurrying swiftly one after another the overburdened luggers spread wings and flutter away thrice the great cry rings rippling through the gray air and over the green sea and over the far flooded shell reefs where the huge white flashes are sheet lightning of breakers and over the weird wash of corpses coming in it is the steam call of the relief boat hastening to rescue the living to gather in the dead the tremendous tragedy is over out of the sea's strength i there are regions of louisiana coast whose aspect seems not of the present but of the immemorial past of that epoch when low flat reaches of primordial continent first rose into form above a silurian sea to indulge this geologic dream any fervid and breezeless day there it is only necessary to ignore the evolutional protests of a few blue asters or a few composite flowers of the coryopsis sort which contrive to display their rare flashes of color through the general waving of cat heads blood weeds wild cane and marsh grasses for at a hasty glance the general appearance of this marsh verdure is vague enough as it ranges away towards the sand to convey the idea of amphibious vegetation a primitive flora as yet undecided whether to retain marine habits and forms or to assume terrestrial ones and the occasional inspection of surprising shapes might strengthen this fancy queer flat lying and many branching things which resemble sea weeds in juiciness and color and consistency crackle under your feet from time to time the moist and weighty air seems heated rather from below than from above less by the sun than by the radiation of a cooling world and the mists of morning or evening appear to simulate the vapory exhalation of volcanic forces latent but only dozing and uncomfortably close to the surface and indeed geologists have actually averred that those rare elevations of the soil which with their heavy coronets of evergreen foliage not only look like islands but are so called in the french nomenclature of the coast have been prominences created by ancient mud volcanoes the family of a spanish fisherman feliu viosca once occupied and gave its name to such an islet quite close to the gulf shore the loftiest bit of land along fourteen miles of just such marshy coast as i have spoken of landward it dominated a desolation that wearied the eye to look at a wilderness of reedy sloughs patched at intervals with ranges of bitter weed tufts of elbow bushes and broad reaches of saw grass stretching away to a bluish green line of woods that closed the horizon and imperfectly drained in the driest season by a slimy little bayou that continually vomited foul water into the sea the point had been much discussed by geologists it proved a godsend to united states surveyors weary of attempting to take observations among quagmires moccasins and arborescent weeds from fifteen to twenty feet high savage fishermen at some unrecorded time had heaped upon the eminence a hill of clam shells refuse of a million feasts earth again had been formed over these perhaps by the blind agency of worms working through centuries unnumbered and the new soil had given birth to a luxuriant vegetation millennial oaks interknotted their roots below its surface and vouchsafed protection to many a frailer growth of shrub or tree wild orange water willow palmetto locust pomegranate and many trailing tendrilled things both green and gray then perhaps about half a century ago a few white fishermen cleared a place for themselves in this grove and built a few palmetto cottages with boat houses and a wharf facing the bayou later on this temporary fishing station became a permanent settlement homes constructed of heavy timber and plaster mixed with the trailing moss of the oaks and cypresses took the places of the frail and fragrant huts of palmetto still the population itself retained a floating character it ebbed and came according to season and circumstances according to luck or loss in the tilling of the sea viosca the founder of the settlement always remained he always managed to do well he owned several luggers and sloops which were hired out upon excellent terms he could make large and profitable contracts with new orleans fish dealers and he was vaguely suspected of possessing more occult resources there were some confused stories current about his having once been a daring smuggler and having only been reformed by the pleadings of his wife carmen a little brown woman who had followed him from barcelona to share his fortunes in the western world on hot days when the shade was full of thin sweet scents the place had a tropical charm a drowsy peace nothing except the peculiar appearance of the line of oaks facing the gulf could have conveyed to the visitor any suggestion of days in which the trilling of crickets and the fluting of birds had ceased of nights when the voices of the marsh had been hushed for fear in one enormous rank the veteran trees stood shoulder to shoulder but in the attitude of giants over mastered forced backward towards the marsh made to recoil by the might of the ghostly enemy with whom they had striven a thousand years the shrieker the sky sweeper the awful sea wind never had he given them so terrible a wrestle as on the night of the tenth of august eighteen hundred and fifty six all the waves of the excited gulf thronged in as if to see and lifted up their voices and pushed and roared until the cheniere was islanded by such a billowing as no white man's eyes had ever looked upon before grandly the oaks bore themselves but every fibre of their knotted thews was strained in the unequal contest and two of the giants were overthrown upturning as they fell roots coiled and huge as the serpent limbs of titans moved to its entrails all the islet trembled while the sea magnified its menace and reached out whitely to the prostrate trees but the rest of the oaks stood on and strove in line and saved the habitations defended by them ii before a little waxen image of the mother and child an odd little virgin with an indian face brought home by feliu as a gift after one of his mexican voyages carmen viosca had burned candles and prayed sometimes telling her beads sometimes murmuring the litanies she knew by heart sometimes also reading from a prayer book worn and greasy as a long used pack of cards it was particularly stained at one page a page on which her tears had fallen many a lonely night a page with a clumsy wood cut representing a celestial lamp a symbolic radiance shining through darkness and on either side a kneeling angel with folded wings and beneath this rudely wrought symbol of the perpetual calm appeared in big coarse type the title of a prayer that has been offered up through many a century doubtless by wives of spanish mariners contra las tempestades once she became very much frightened after a partial lull the storm had suddenly redoubled its force the ground shook the house quivered and creaked the wind brayed and screamed and pushed and scuffled at the door and the water which had been whipping in through every crevice all at once rose over the threshold and flooded the dwelling carmen dipped her finger in the water and tasted it it was salt and none of feliu's boats had yet come in doubtless they had been driven into some far away bayous by the storm the only boat at the settlement the carmencita had been almost wrecked by running upon a snag three days before there was at least a fortnight's work for the ship carpenter of dead cypress point and feliu was sleeping as if nothing unusual had happened the heavy sleep of a sailor heedless of commotions and voices and his men miguel and mateo were at the other end of the cheniere with a scream carmen aroused feliu he raised himself upon his elbow rubbed his eyes and asked her with exasperating calmness que tienes que tienes what ails thee oh feliu the sea is coming upon us she answered in the same tongue but she screamed out a word inspired by her fear she did not cry se nos viene el mar encima but se nos viene la altura the name that conveys the terrible thought of depth swallowed up in height the height of the high sea no lo creo muttered feliu looking at the floor then in a quiet deep voice he said pointing to an oar in the corner of the room echame ese remo she gave it to him still reclining upon one elbow feliu measured the depth of the water with his thumb nail upon the blade of the oar and then bade carmen light his pipe for him his calmness reassured her for half an hour more undismayed by the clamoring of the wind or the calling of the sea feliu silently smoked his pipe and watched his oar the water rose a little higher and he made another mark then it climbed a little more but not so rapidly and he smiled at carmen as he made a third mark como creia he exclaimed no hay porque asustarse el agua baja and as carmen would have continued to pray he rebuked her fears and bade her try to obtain some rest basta ya de plegarios querida vete y duerme his tone though kindly was imperative and carmen accustomed to obey him laid herself down by his side and soon for very weariness slept it was a feverish sleep nevertheless shattered at brief intervals by terrible sounds sounds magnified by her nervous condition a sleep visited by dreams that mingled in a strange way with the impressions of the storm and more than once made her heart stop and start again at its own stopping one of these fancies she never could forget a dream about little concha conchita her firstborn who now slept far away in the old churchyard at barcelona she had tried to become resigned not to think but the child would come back night after night though the earth lay heavy upon her night after night through long distances of time and space oh the fancied clinging of infant lips the thrilling touch of little ghostly hands those phantom caresses that torture mothers hearts night after night through many a month of pain then for a time the gentle presence ceased to haunt her seemed to have lain down to sleep forever under the high bright grass and yellow flowers why did it return that night of all nights to kiss her to cling to her to nestle in her arms for in her dream she thought herself still kneeling before the waxen image while the terrors of the tempest were ever deepening about her raving of winds and booming of waters and a shaking of the land and before her even as she prayed her dream prayer the waxen virgin became tall as a woman and taller rising to the roof and smiling as she grew then carmen would have cried out for fear but that something smothered her voice paralyzed her tongue and the virgin silently stooped above her and placed in her arms the child the brown child with the indian face and the child whitened in her hands and changed seeming as it changed to send a sharp pain through her heart an old pain linked somehow with memories of bright windy spanish hills and summer scent of olive groves and all the luminous past it looked into her face with the soft dark gaze with the unforgotten smile of dead conchita and carmen wished to thank the smiling virgin for that priceless bliss and lifted up her eyes but the sickness of ghostly fear returned upon her when she looked for now the mother seemed as a woman long dead and the smile was the smile of fleshlessness and the places of the eyes were voids and darknesses and the sea sent up so vast a roar that the dwelling rocked carmen started from sleep to find her heart throbbing so that the couch shook with it night was growing gray the door had just been opened and slammed again through the rain whipped panes she discerned the passing shape of feliu making for the beach a broad and bearded silhouette bending against the wind still the waxen virgin smiled her mexican smile but now she was only seven inches high and her bead glass eyes seemed to twinkle with kindliness while the flame of the last expiring taper struggled for life in the earthen socket at her feet iii rain and a blind sky and a bursting sea feliu and his men miguel and mateo looked out upon the thundering and flashing of the monstrous tide the wind had fallen and the gray air was full of gulls behind the cheniere back to the cloudy line of low woods many miles away stretched a wash of lead colored water with a green point piercing it here and there elbow bushes or wild cane tall enough to keep their heads above the flood but the inundation was visibly decreasing with the passing of each hour more and more green patches and points had been showing themselves by degrees the course of the bayou had become defined two parallel winding lines of dwarf timber and bushy shrubs traversing the"
