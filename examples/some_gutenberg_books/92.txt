saw the great head lower and flatten out the body crouch and the long tail quiver as the beast slunk cautiously toward the trees upon the opposite side immediately tarzan was alert he lifted his head and sniffed the slow jungle breeze what was it that had attracted numa's attention and taken him soft footed and silent away from the scene of his discomfiture just as the lion disappeared among the trees beyond the clearing tarzan caught upon the down coming wind the explanation of his new interest the scent spoor of man was wafted strongly to the sensitive nostrils caching the remainder of the deer's hind quarter in the crotch of a tree the ape man wiped his greasy palms upon his naked thighs and swung off in pursuit of numa a broad well beaten elephant path led into the forest from the clearing parallel to this slunk numa while above him tarzan moved through the trees the shadow of a wraith the savage cat and the savage man saw numa's quarry almost simultaneously though both had known before it came within the vision of their eyes that it was a black man their sensitive nostrils had told them this much and tarzan's had told him that the scent spoor was that of a stranger old and a male for race and sex and age each has its own distinctive scent it was an old man that made his way alone through the gloomy jungle a wrinkled dried up little old man hideously scarred and tattooed and strangely garbed with the skin of a hyena about his shoulders and the dried head mounted upon his grey pate tarzan recognized the ear marks of the witch doctor and awaited numa's charge with a feeling of pleasurable anticipation for the ape man had no love for witch doctors but in the instant that numa did charge the white man suddenly recalled that the lion had stolen his kill a few minutes before and that revenge is sweet the first intimation the black man had that he was in danger was the crash of twigs as numa charged through the bushes into the game trail not twenty yards behind him then he turned to see a huge black maned lion racing toward him and even as he turned numa seized him at the same instant the ape man dropped from an overhanging limb full upon the lion's back and as he alighted he plunged his knife into the tawny side behind the left shoulder tangled the fingers of his right hand in the long mane buried his teeth in numa's neck and wound his powerful legs about the beast's torso with a roar of pain and rage numa reared up and fell backward upon the ape man but still the mighty man thing clung to his hold and repeatedly the long knife plunged rapidly into his side over and over rolled numa the lion clawing and biting at the air roaring and growling horribly in savage attempt to reach the thing upon its back more than once was tarzan almost brushed from his hold he was battered and bruised and covered with blood from numa and dirt from the trail yet not for an instant did he lessen the ferocity of his mad attack nor his grim hold upon the back of his antagonist to have loosened for an instant his grip there would have been to bring him within reach of those tearing talons or rending fangs and have ended forever the grim career of this jungle bred english lord where he had fallen beneath the spring of the lion the witch doctor lay torn and bleeding unable to drag himself away and watched the terrific battle between these two lords of the jungle his sunken eyes glittered and his wrinkled lips moved over toothless gums as he mumbled weird incantations to the demons of his cult for a time he felt no doubt as to the outcome the strange white man must certainly succumb to terrible simba whoever heard of a lone man armed only with a knife slaying so mighty a beast yet presently the old black man's eyes went wider and he commenced to have his doubts and misgivings what wonderful sort of creature was this that battled with simba and held his own despite the mighty muscles of the king of beasts and slowly there dawned in those sunken eyes gleaming so brightly from the scarred and wrinkled face the light of a dawning recollection gropingly backward into the past reached the fingers of memory until at last they seized upon a faint picture faded and yellow with the passing years it was the picture of a lithe white skinned youth swinging through the trees in company with a band of huge apes and the old eyes blinked and a great fear came into them the superstitious fear of one who believes in ghosts and spirits and demons and came the time once more when the witch doctor no longer doubted the outcome of the duel yet his first judgment was reversed for now he knew that the jungle god would slay simba and the old black was even more terrified of his own impending fate at the hands of the victor than he had been by the sure and sudden death which the triumphant lion would have meted out to him he saw the lion weaken from loss of blood he saw the mighty limbs tremble and stagger and at last he saw the beast sink down to rise no more he saw the forest god or demon rise from the vanquished foe and placing a foot upon the still quivering carcass raise his face to the moon and bay out a hideous cry that froze the ebbing blood in the veins of the witch doctor 4 prophecy and fulfillment then tarzan turned his attention to the man he had not slain numa to save the negro he had merely done it in revenge upon the lion but now that he saw the old man lying helpless and dying before him something akin to pity touched his savage heart in his youth he would have slain the witch doctor without the slightest compunction but civilization had had its softening effect upon him even as it does upon the nations and races which it touches though it had not yet gone far enough with tarzan to render him either cowardly or effeminate he saw an old man suffering and dying and he stooped and felt of his wounds and stanched the flow of blood who are you asked the old man in a trembling voice i am tarzan tarzan of the apes replied the ape man and not without a greater touch of pride than he would have said i am john clayton lord greystoke the witch doctor shook convulsively and closed his eyes when he opened them again there was in them a resignation to whatever horrible fate awaited him at the hands of this feared demon of the woods why do you not kill me he asked why should i kill you inquired tarzan you have not harmed me and anyway you are already dying numa the lion has killed you you would not kill me surprise and incredulity were in the tones of the quavering old voice i would save you if i could replied tarzan but that cannot be done why did you think i would kill you for a moment the old man was silent when he spoke it was evidently after some little effort to muster his courage i knew you of old he said when you ranged the jungle in the country of mbonga the chief i was already a witch doctor when you slew kulonga and the others and when you robbed our huts and our poison pot at first i did not remember you but at last i did the white skinned ape that lived with the hairy apes and made life miserable in the village of mbonga the chief the forest god the munango keewati for whom we set food outside our gates and who came and ate it tell me before i die are you man or devil tarzan laughed i am a man he said the old fellow sighed and shook his head you have tried to save me from simba he said for that i shall reward you i am a great witch doctor listen to me white man i see bad days ahead of you it is writ in my own blood which i have smeared upon my palm a god greater even than you will rise up and strike you down turn back munango keewati turn back before it is too late danger lies ahead of you and danger lurks behind but greater is the danger before i see he paused and drew a long gasping breath then he crumpled into a little wrinkled heap and died tarzan wondered what else he had seen it was very late when the ape man re entered the boma and lay down among his black warriors none had seen him go and none saw him return he thought about the warning of the old witch doctor before he fell asleep and he thought of it again after he awoke but he did not turn back for he was unafraid though had he known what lay in store for one he loved most in all the world he would have flown through the trees to her side and allowed the gold of opar to remain forever hidden in its forgotten storehouse behind him that morning another white man pondered something he had heard during the night and very nearly did he give up his project and turn back upon his trail it was werper the murderer who in the still of the night had heard far away upon the trail ahead of him a sound that had filled his cowardly soul with terror a sound such as he never before had heard in all his life nor dreamed that such a frightful thing could emanate from the lungs of a god created creature he had heard the victory cry of the bull ape as tarzan had screamed it forth into the face of goro the moon and he had trembled then and hidden his face and now in the broad light of a new day he trembled again as he recalled it and would have turned back from the nameless danger the echo of that frightful sound seemed to portend had he not stood in even greater fear of achmet zek his master and so tarzan of the apes forged steadily ahead toward opar's ruined ramparts and behind him slunk werper jackal like and only god knew what lay in store for each at the edge of the desolate valley overlooking the golden domes and minarets of opar tarzan halted by night he would go alone to the treasure vault reconnoitering for he had determined that caution should mark his every move upon this expedition with the coming of night he set forth and werper who had scaled the cliffs alone behind the ape man's party and hidden through the day among the rough boulders of the mountain top slunk stealthily after him the boulder strewn plain between the valley's edge and the mighty granite kopje outside the city's walls where lay the entrance to the passage way leading to the treasure vault gave the belgian ample cover as he followed tarzan toward opar he saw the giant ape man swing himself nimbly up the face of the great rock werper clawing fearfully during the perilous ascent sweating in terror almost palsied by fear but spurred on by avarice following upward until at last he stood upon the summit of the rocky hill tarzan was nowhere in sight for a time werper hid behind one of the lesser boulders that were scattered over the top of the hill but seeing or hearing nothing of the englishman he crept from his place of concealment to undertake a systematic search of his surroundings in the hope that he might discover the location of the treasure in ample time to make his escape before tarzan returned for it was the belgian's desire merely to locate the gold that after tarzan had departed he might come in safety with his followers and carry away as much as he could transport he found the narrow cleft leading downward into the heart of the kopje along well worn granite steps he advanced quite to the dark mouth of the tunnel into which the runway disappeared but here he halted fearing to enter lest he meet tarzan returning the ape man far ahead of him groped his way along the rocky passage until he came to the ancient wooden door a moment later he stood within the treasure chamber where ages since long dead hands had ranged the lofty rows of precious ingots for the rulers of that great continent which now lies submerged beneath the waters of the atlantic no sound broke the stillness of the subterranean vault there was no evidence that another had discovered the forgotten wealth since last the ape man had visited its hiding place satisfied tarzan turned and retraced his steps toward the summit of the kopje werper from the concealment of a jutting granite shoulder watched him pass up from the shadows of the stairway and advance toward the edge of the hill which faced the rim of the valley where the waziri awaited the signal of their master then werper slipping stealthily from his hiding place dropped into the somber darkness of the entrance and disappeared tarzan halting upon the kopje's edge raised his voice in the thunderous roar of a lion twice at regular intervals he repeated the call standing in attentive silence for several minutes after the echoes of the third call had died away and then from far across the valley faintly came an answering roar once twice thrice basuli the waziri chieftain had heard and replied tarzan again made his way toward the treasure vault knowing that in a few hours his blacks would be with him ready to bear away another fortune in the strangely shaped golden ingots of opar in the meantime he would carry as much of the precious metal to the summit of the kopje as he could six trips he made in the five hours before basuli reached the kopje and at the end of that time he had transported forty eight ingots to the edge of the great boulder carrying upon each trip a load which might well have staggered two ordinary men yet his giant frame showed no evidence of fatigue as he helped to raise his ebon warriors to the hill top with the rope that had been brought for the purpose six times he had returned to the treasure chamber and six times werper the belgian had cowered in the black shadows at the far end of the long vault once again came the ape man and this time there came with him fifty fighting men turning porters for love of the only creature in the world who might command of their fierce and haughty natures such menial service fifty two more ingots passed out of the vaults making the total of one hundred which tarzan intended taking away with him as the last of the waziri filed from the chamber tarzan turned back for a last glimpse of the fabulous wealth upon which his two inroads had made no appreciable impression before he extinguished the single candle he had brought with him for the purpose and the flickering light of which had cast the first alleviating rays into the impenetrable darkness of the buried chamber that it had known for the countless ages since it had lain forgotten of man tarzan's mind reverted to that first occasion upon which he had entered the treasure vault coming upon it by chance as he fled from the pits beneath the temple where he had been hidden by la the high priestess of the sun worshipers he recalled the scene within the temple when he had lain stretched upon the sacrificial altar while la with high raised dagger stood above him and the rows of priests and priestesses awaited in the ecstatic hysteria of fanaticism the first gush of their victim's warm blood that they might fill their golden goblets and drink to the glory of their flaming god the brutal and bloody interruption by tha the mad priest passed vividly before the ape man's recollective eyes the flight of the votaries before the insane blood lust of the hideous creature the brutal attack upon la and his own part of the grim tragedy when he had battled with the infuriated oparian and left him dead at the feet of the priestess he would have profaned this and much more passed through tarzan's memory as he stood gazing at the long tiers of dull yellow metal he wondered if la still ruled the temples of the ruined city whose crumbling walls rose upon the very foundations about him had she finally been forced into a union with one of her grotesque priests it seemed a hideous fate indeed for one so beautiful with a shake of his head tarzan stepped to the flickering candle extinguished its feeble rays and turned toward the exit behind him the spy waited for him to be gone he had learned the secret for which he had come and now he could return at his leisure to his waiting followers bring them to the treasure vault and carry away all the gold that they could stagger under the waziri had reached the outer end of the tunnel and were winding upward toward the fresh air and the welcome starlight of the kopje's summit before tarzan shook off the detaining hand of reverie and started slowly after them once again and he thought for the last time he closed the massive door of the treasure room in the darkness behind him werper rose and stretched his cramped muscles he stretched forth a hand and lovingly caressed a golden ingot on the nearest tier he raised it from its immemorial resting place and weighed it in his hands he clutched it to his bosom in an ecstasy of avarice tarzan dreamed of the happy homecoming which lay before him of dear arms about his neck and a soft cheek pressed to his but there rose to dispel that dream the memory of the old witch doctor and his warning and then in the span of a few brief seconds the hopes of both these men were shattered the one forgot even his greed in the panic of terror the other was plunged into total forgetfulness of the past by a jagged fragment of rock which gashed a deep cut upon his head 5 the altar of the flaming god it was at the moment that tarzan turned from the closed door to pursue his way to the outer world the thing came without warning one instant all was quiet and stability the next and the world rocked the tortured sides of the narrow passageway split and crumbled great blocks of granite dislodged from the ceiling tumbled into the narrow way choking it and the walls bent inward upon the wreckage beneath the blow of a fragment of the roof tarzan staggered back against the door to the treasure room his weight pushed it open and his body rolled inward upon the floor in the great apartment where the treasure lay less damage was wrought by the earthquake a few ingots toppled from the higher tiers a single piece of the rocky ceiling splintered off and crashed downward to the floor and the walls cracked though they did not collapse there was but the single shock no other followed to complete the damage undertaken by the first werper thrown to his length by the suddenness and violence of the disturbance staggered to his feet when he found himself unhurt groping his way toward the far end of the chamber he sought the candle which tarzan had left stuck in its own wax upon the protruding end of an ingot by striking numerous matches the belgian at last found what he sought and when a moment later the sickly rays relieved the stygian darkness about him he breathed a nervous sigh of relief for the impenetrable gloom had accentuated the terrors of his situation as they became accustomed to the light the man turned his eyes toward the door his one thought now was of escape from this frightful tomb and as he did so he saw the body of the naked giant lying stretched upon the floor just within the doorway werper drew back in sudden fear of detection but a second glance convinced him that the englishman was dead from a great gash in the man's head a pool of blood had collected upon the concrete floor quickly the belgian leaped over the prostrate form of his erstwhile host and without a thought of succor for the man in whom for aught he knew life still remained he bolted for the passageway and safety but his renewed hopes were soon dashed just beyond the doorway he found the passage completely clogged and choked by impenetrable masses of shattered rock once more he turned and re entered the treasure vault taking the candle from its place he commenced a systematic search of the apartment nor had he gone far before he discovered another door in the opposite end of the room a door which gave upon creaking hinges to the weight of his body beyond the door lay another narrow passageway along this werper made his way ascending a flight of stone steps to another corridor twenty feet above the level of the first the flickering candle lighted the way before him and a moment later he was thankful for the possession of this crude and antiquated luminant which a few hours before he might have looked upon with contempt for it showed him just in time a yawning pit apparently terminating the tunnel he was traversing before him was a circular shaft he held the candle above it and peered downward below him at a great distance he saw the light reflected back from the surface of a pool of water he had come upon a well he raised the candle above his head and peered across the black void and there upon the opposite side he saw the continuation of the tunnel but how was he to span the gulf as he stood there measuring the distance to the opposite side and wondering if he dared venture so great a leap there broke suddenly upon his startled ears a piercing scream which diminished gradually until it ended in a series of dismal moans the voice seemed partly human yet so hideous that it might well have emanated from the tortured throat of a lost soul writhing in the fires of hell the belgian shuddered and looked fearfully upward for the scream had seemed to come from above him as he looked he saw an opening far overhead and a patch of sky pinked with brilliant stars his half formed intention to call for help was expunged by the terrifying cry where such a voice lived no human creatures could dwell he dared not reveal himself to whatever inhabitants dwelt in the place above him he cursed himself for a fool that he had ever embarked upon such a mission he wished himself safely back in the camp of achmet zek and would almost have embraced an opportunity to give himself up to the military authorities of the congo if by so doing he might be rescued from the frightful predicament in which he now was he listened fearfully but the cry was not repeated and at last spurred to desperate means he gathered himself for the leap across the chasm going back twenty paces he took a running start and at the edge of the well leaped upward and outward in an attempt to gain the opposite side in his hand he clutched the sputtering candle and as he took the leap the rush of air extinguished it in utter darkness he flew through space clutching outward for a hold should his feet miss the invisible ledge he struck the edge of the door of the opposite terminus of the rocky tunnel with his knees slipped backward clutched desperately for a moment and at last hung half within and half without the opening but he was safe for several minutes he dared not move but clung weak and sweating where he lay at last cautiously he drew himself well within the tunnel and again he lay at full length upon the floor fighting to regain control of his shattered nerves when his knees struck the edge of the tunnel he had dropped the candle presently hoping against hope that it had fallen upon the floor of the passageway rather than back into the depths of the well he rose upon all fours and commenced a diligent search for the little tallow cylinder which now seemed infinitely more precious to him than all the fabulous wealth of the hoarded ingots of opar and when at last he found it he clasped it to him and sank back sobbing and exhausted for many minutes he lay trembling and broken but finally he drew himself to a sitting posture and taking a match from his pocket lighted the stump of the candle which remained to him with the light he found it easier to regain control of his nerves and presently he was again making his way along the tunnel in search of an avenue of escape the horrid cry that had come down to him from above through the ancient well shaft still haunted him so that he trembled in terror at even the sounds of his own cautious advance he had gone forward but a short distance when to his chagrin a wall of masonry barred his farther progress closing the tunnel completely from top to bottom and from side to side what could it mean werper was an educated and intelligent man his military training had taught him to use his mind for the purpose for which it was intended a blind tunnel such as this was senseless it must continue beyond the wall someone at some time in the past had had it blocked for an unknown purpose of his own the man fell to examining the masonry by the light of his candle to his delight he discovered that the thin blocks of hewn stone of which it was constructed were fitted in loosely without mortar or cement he tugged upon one of them and to his joy found that it was easily removable one after another he pulled out the blocks until he had opened an aperture large enough to admit his body then he crawled through into a large low chamber across this another door barred his way but this too gave before his efforts for it was not barred a long dark corridor showed before him but before he had followed it far his candle burned down until it scorched his fingers with an oath he dropped it to the floor where it sputtered for a moment and went out now he was in total darkness and again terror rode heavily astride his neck what further pitfalls and dangers lay ahead he could not guess but that he was as far as ever from liberty he was quite willing to believe so depressing is utter absence of light to one in unfamiliar surroundings slowly he groped his way along feeling with his hands upon the tunnel's walls and cautiously with his feet ahead of him upon the floor before he could take a single forward step how long he crept on thus he could not guess but at last feeling that the tunnel's length was interminable and exhausted by his efforts by terror and loss of sleep he determined to lie down and rest before proceeding farther when he awoke there was no change in the surrounding blackness he might have slept a second or a day he could not know but that he had slept for some time was attested by the fact that he felt refreshed and hungry again he commenced his groping advance but this time he had gone but a short distance when he emerged into a room which was lighted through an opening in the ceiling from which a flight of concrete steps led downward to the floor of the chamber above him through the aperture werper could see sunlight glancing from massive columns which were twined about by clinging vines he listened but he heard no sound other than the soughing of the wind through leafy branches the hoarse cries of birds and the chattering of monkeys boldly he ascended the stairway to find himself in a circular court just before him stood a stone altar stained with rusty brown discolorations at the time werper gave no thought to an explanation of these stains later their origin became all too hideously apparent to him beside the opening in the floor just behind the altar through which he had entered the court from the subterranean chamber below the belgian discovered several doors leading from the enclosure upon the level of the floor above and circling the"
