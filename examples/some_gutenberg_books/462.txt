"1" "cards perhaps i may have one in my pocket book let me see mr lake opened his porte monnaie and uttered a exclamation of surprise by jove he said i am in a fix phil looked at him inquiringly i took out a roll of bills at the house of my aunt where i stayed last night explained mr lake and must have neglected to replace them i hope you have not lost them said phil politely oh no my aunt will find them and take care of them for me so that i shall get them back the trouble is that i am left temporarily without funds but you can get money in the city suggested phil no doubt only it is necessary for me to stay over a train ten miles short of the city mr lionel lake seemed very much perplexed if i knew some one in the cars he said reflectively it did occur to phil to offer to loan him something but the scantiness of his own resources warned him that it would not be prudent so he remained silent finally mr lake appeared to have an idea have you got five dollars philip he said familiarly yes sir answered philip slowly then i'll make a proposal lend it to me and i will give you this ring as security it is worth twenty five dollars easily he drew from his vest pocket a neat gold ring with some sort of a stone in the setting there said mr lake i'll give you this ring and my address and you can bring it to my office to morrow morning i'll give you back the five dollars and one dollar for the accommodation that's good interest isn't it but i might keep the ring and sell it suggested phil oh i am not afraid you look honest i will trust you said the young man in a careless off hand manner say is it a bargain yes answered phil it occurred to him that he could not earn a dollar more easily besides he would be doing a favor to this very polite young man all right then five dollars of phil's scanty hoard was handed to mr lake who in return gave phil the ring which he put on his finger he also handed phil a scrap of paper on which he penciled lionel lake no 237 broadway i'm ever so much obliged he said good by i get out at the next station phil was congratulating himself on his good stroke of business when the conductor entered the car followed by a young lady when they came to where phil was seated the young lady said that is my ring on that boy's finger aha we've found the thief then said the conductor boy give up the ring you stole from this young lady as he spoke he placed his hand on phil's shoulder stole repeated phil gasping i don't understand you oh yes you do said the conductor roughly chapter v an overbearing conductor no matter how honest a boy may be a sudden charge of theft is likely to make him look confused and guilty such was the case with phil i assure you he said earnestly that i did not steal this ring where did you get it then demanded the conductor roughly he was one of those men who in any position will make themselves disagreeable moreover he was a man who always thought ill of others when there was any chance of doing so in fact he preferred to credit his fellows with bad qualities rather than with good it was handed me by a young man who just left the car said phil that's a likely story sneered the conductor young men are not in the habit of giving valuable rings to strangers he did not give it to me i advanced him five dollars on it what was the young man's name asked the conductor incredulously there's his name and address answered phil drawing from his pocket the paper handed him by mr lake lionel lake 237 broadway repeated the conductor if there is any such person which i very much doubt you are probably a confederate of his you have no right to say this returned phil indignantly i haven't haven't i snapped the conductor do you know what i am going to do with you if you wish me to return the ring to this young lady i will do so if she is positive it is hers yes you must do that but it won't get you out of trouble i shall hand you over to a policeman as soon as we reach new york phil was certainly dismayed for he felt that it might be difficult for him to prove that he came honestly in possession of the ring the fact is added the conductor your story is too thin conductor said a new voice you are doing the boy an injustice the speaker was an old man with gray hair but of form still robust though he was at least sixty five he sat in the seat just behind phil thank you sir said phil gratefully i understand my business said the conductor impertinently and don't need any instructions from you young man said the old gentleman in a very dignified tone i have usually found officials of your class polite and gentlemanly but you are an exception who are you asked the conductor rudely what right have you to put in your oar as to who i am i will answer you by and by in reference to the boy i have to say that his story is correct i heard the whole conversation between him and the young man from whom he received the ring and i can testify that he has told the truth at any rate he has received stolen property not knowing it to be stolen the young man was an entire stranger to him and though i suspected that he was an unscrupulous adventurer the boy has not had experience enough to judge men very well if he's innocent he can prove it when he's brought to trial said the conductor as for you sir it's none of your business young man you asked me a short time since who i am do you want to know i am not very particular then sir i have to inform you that i am richard grant the president of this road the conductor's face was a curious and interesting study when he heard this announcement he knew that the old man whom he had insulted had a right to discharge him from his position and bully as he had shown himself he was now inclined to humble himself to save his place i beg your pardon sir he said in a composed tone if i had known who you were i wouldn't have spoken as i did i had a claim to be treated like a gentleman even if i had no connection with the road he said if you say the boy's all right i won't interfere with him continued the conductor my testimony would clear him from any charge that might be brought against him said the president i saw him enter the car and know he has had no opportunity to take the ring if he'll give me back the ring that's all i want said the young lady that i am willing to do though i lose five dollars by it said philip do so my boy said the president i take it for granted that the young lady's claim is a just one upon this philip drew the ring from his finger and handed it to the young lady who went back to the car where her friends were sitting i hope sir said the conductor anxiously that you won't be prejudiced against me on account of this affair i am sorry to say that i can't help feeling prejudiced against you returned the president dryly but i won't allow this feeling to injure you if upon inquiring i find that you are otherwise an efficient officer thank you sir i am glad that my presence has saved this boy from being the victim of an injustice let this be a lesson to you in future the conductor walked away looking quite chop fallen and philip turned to his new friend i am very much indebted to you sir he said but for you i should have found myself in serious trouble i am glad to have prevented an injustice my lad i am sorry i could not save you from loss also that enterprising rogue has gone off with five dollars belonging to you i hope the loss will not be a serious one to you it was more than a third part of my capital sir said phil rather ruefully i am sorry for that i suppose however you are not dependent upon your own resources yes sir i am have you no parents then asked mr grant with interest no sir that is i have a step mother and what are your plans if you are willing to tell me i am going to new york to try to make a living i cannot commend your plan my young friend unless there is a good reason for it i think there is a good reason for it sir i hope you have not run away from home no sir i left home with my step mother's knowledge and consent that is well i don't want wholly to discourage you and so i will tell you that i too came to new york at your age with the same object in view with less money in my pocket than you possess and now you are the president of a railroad said phil hopefully yes but i had a hard struggle before i reached that position i am not afraid of hard work sir that is in your favor perhaps you may be as lucky as i have been you may call at my office in the city if you feel inclined as mr grant spoke he put in phil's hand a card bearing his name and address in wall street thank you sir said phil gratefully i shall be glad to call i may need advice if you seek advice and follow it you will be an exception to the general rule said the president smiling one thing more you have met with a loss which to you is a serious one allow me to bear it and accept this bill but sir it is not right that you should bear it commenced phil then looking at the bill he said haven't you made a mistake this is a ten dollar bill i know it accept the other five as an evidence of my interest in you by the way i go to philadelphia and washington before my return to new york and shall not return for three or four days after that time you will find me at my office i am in luck after all thought phil cheerfully in spite of the mean trick of mr lionel lake chapter vi signor orlando so phil reached new york in very fair spirits he found himself thanks to the liberality of mr grant in a better financial position than when he left home as he left the depot and found himself in the streets of new york he felt like a stranger upon the threshold of a new life he knew almost nothing about the great city he had entered and was at a loss where to seek for lodgings it's a cold day said a sociable voice at his elbow looking around phil saw that the speaker was a sallow complexioned young man with black hair and mustache a loose black felt hat crushed at the crown giving him rather a rakish look yes sir answered phil politely stranger in the city i expect yes sir never mind the sir i ain't used to ceremony i am signor orlando signor orlando repeated phil rather puzzled are you an italian well yes returned signor orlando with a wink that's what i am or what people think me but i was born in vermont and am half irish and half yankee how did you come by your name then i took it answered his companion you see dear boy i'm a professional a what a professional singer and clog dancer i believe i am pretty well known to the public continued signor orlando complacently last summer i traveled with jenks brown's circus of course you've heard of them through the winter i am employed at bowerman's varieties in the bowery i appear every night and at two matinees weekly it must be confessed that phil was considerably impressed by the professional character of signor orlando he had never met an actor or public performer of any description and was disposed to have a high respect for a man who filled such a conspicuous position there was not to be sure anything very impressive about signor orlando's appearance his face did not indicate talent and his dress was shabby but for all that he was a man familiar with the public a man of gifts i should like to see you on the stage said phil respectfully so you shall my dear boy so you shall i'll get you a pass from mr bowerman which way are you going i don't know answered phil puzzled i should like to find a cheap boarding house but i don't know the city i do answered signor orlando promptly why not come to my house have you a house i mean my boarding house it's some distance away suppose we take a horse car all right answered phil relieved to find a guide in the labyrinth of the great city i live on fifth street near the bowery a very convenient location said orlando if we may take the liberty to call him thus fifth avenue asked phil who did not know the difference oh no that's a peg above my style i am not a vanderbilt nor yet an astor is the price moderate asked phil anxiously i must make my money last as long as i can for i don't know when i shall get a place to be sure you might room with me only i've got a hall bedroom perhaps we might manage it though i think i should prefer a room by myself said phil who reflected that signor orlando was a stranger as yet oh well i'll speak to the old lady and i guess she can accommodate you with a hall bedroom like mine on the third floor what should i have to pay a dollar and a quarter a week and you can get your meals where you please i think that will suit me said phil thoughtfully after leaving the car a minute's walk brought them to a shabby three story house of brick there was a stable opposite and a group of dirty children were playing in front of it this is where i hang out said signor orlando cheerfully as the poet says there is no place like home if this had been true it was not much to be regretted since the home in question was far from attractive signor orlando rang the bell and a stout woman of german aspect answered the call so you haf come back herr orlando said this lady i hope you haf brought them two weeks rent you owe me all in good time mrs schlessinger said orlando but you see i have brought some one with me is he your bruder now asked the lady no he is not unfortunately for me his name is orlando coughed philip brent suggested our hero just so philip brent i am glad to see mr prent said the landlady and is he an actor like you signor orlando not yet we don't know what may happen but he comes on business mrs schlessinger he wants a room the landlady brightened up she had two rooms vacant and a new lodger was a godsend i vill show mr prent what rooms i haf she said come up stairs mr prent the good woman toiled up the staircase panting for she was asthmatic and phil followed the interior of the house was as dingy as the exterior and it was quite dark on the second landing she threw open the door of a back room which being lower than the hall was reached by a step there said she pointing to the faded carpet rumpled bed and cheap pine bureau with the little six by ten looking glass surmounting it this is a peautiful room for a single gentleman or even for a man and his wife my friend mr brent is not married said signor orlando waggishly phil laughed you will have your shoke signor orlando said mrs schlessinger what is the price of this room asked phil three dollars a week mr prent i ought to have four but since you are a steady young gentleman how does she know that phil wondered since you are a steady young gentleman and a friend of signor orlando i will not ask you full price that is more than i can afford to pay said phil shaking his head i think you had better show mr brent the hall bedroom over mine suggested the signor mrs schlessinger toiled up another staircase the two new acquaintances following her she threw open the door of one of those depressing cells known in new york as a hall bedroom it was about five feet wide and eight feet long and was nearly filled up by a cheap bedstead covered by a bed about two inches thick and surmounted at the head by a consumptive looking pillow the paper was torn from the walls in places there was one rickety chair and a wash stand which bore marks of extreme antiquity this is a very neat room for a single gentleman remarked mrs schlessinger phil's spirits fell as he surveyed what was to be his future home it was a sad contrast to his neat comfortable room at home is this room like yours signor orlando he asked faintly as like as two peas answered orlando would you recommend me to take it you couldn't do better how could the signor answer otherwise in presence of a landlady to whom he owed two weeks rent then said phil with a secret shudder i'll take it if the rent is satisfactory a dollar and a quarter a week said mrs schlessinger promptly i'll take it for a week you won't mind paying in advance suggested the landlady i pay my own rent in advance phil's answer was to draw a dollar and a quarter from his purse and pass it to his landlady i'll take possession now said our hero can i have some water to wash my face mrs schlessinger was evidently surprised that any one should want to wash in the middle of the day but made no objections when phil had washed his face and hands he went out with signor orlando to dine at a restaurant on the bowery chapter vii bowerman's varieties the restaurant to which he was taken by signor orlando was thronged with patrons for it was one o'clock on the whole they did not appear to belong to the highest social rank though they were doubtless respectable the table cloths were generally soiled and the waiters had a greasy look phil said nothing but he did not feel quite so hungry as before he entered the signor found two places at one of the tables and they sat down phil examined a greasy bill of fare and found that he could obtain a plate of meat for ten cents this included bread and butter and a dish of mashed potato a cup of tea would be five cents additional i can afford fifteen cents for a meal he thought and called for a plate of roast beef corn beef and cabbage for me said the signor it's very filling he remarked aside to phil they won't give you but a mouthful of beef so it proved but the quality was such that phil did not care for more he ordered a piece of apple pie afterward feeling still hungry i see you're bound to have a square meal said the signor after phil had had it he was bound to confess that he did not feel uncomfortably full yet he had spent twice as much as the signor who dispensed with the tea and pie as superfluous luxuries in the evening signor orlando bent his steps toward bowerman's varieties i hope in a day or two to get a complimentary ticket for you mr brent he said how much is the ticket asked phil fifteen cents best reserved seats twenty five cents i believe i will be extravagant for once said phil and go at my own expense good said the signor huskily you'll feel repaid i'll be bound bowerman always gives the public their money's worth the performance begins at eight o'clock and won't be out until half past eleven less than five cents an hour commented phil what a splendid head you've got said signor orlando admiringly i couldn't have worked that up figures ain't my province it seemed to phil rather a slender cause for compliment but he said nothing since it seemed clear that the computation was beyond his companion's ability as to the performance it was not refined nor was the talent employed first class still phil enjoyed himself after a fashion he had never had it in his power to attend many amusements and this was new to him he naturally looked with interest for the appearance of his new friend and fellow lodger signor orlando appeared dressed in gorgeous array sang a song which did credit to the loudness of his voice rather than its quality and ended by a noisy clog dance which elicited much applause from the boys in the gallery who shared the evening's entertainment for the moderate sum of ten cents the signor was called back to the stage he bowed his thanks and gave another dance then he was permitted to retire as this finished his part of the entertainment he afterward came around in citizen's dress and took a seat in the auditorium beside phil how did you like me mr brent he asked complacently i thought you did well signor orlando you were much applauded yes the audience is very loyal said the proud performer two half grown boys heard phil pronounce the name of his companion and they gazed awe stricken at the famous man that's signor orlando whispered one of the others i know it was the reply such is fame said the signor in a pleased tone to phil people point me out on the streets very gratifying no doubt said our hero but it occurred to him that he would not care to be pointed out as a performer at bowerman's signor orlando however well pleased with himself didn't doubt that phil was impressed by his popularity and perhaps even envied it they didn't stay till the entertainment was over it was of course familiar to the signor and phil felt tired and sleepy for he had passed a part of the afternoon in exploring the city and had walked in all several miles he went back to his lodging house opened the door with a pass key which mrs schlessinger had given him and climbing to his room in the third story undressed and deposited himself in bed the bed was far from luxurious a thin pallet rested on slats so thin that he could feel the slats through it and the covering was insufficient the latter deficiency he made up by throwing his overcoat over the quilt and despite the hardness of his bed he was soon sleeping soundly to morrow i must look for a place he said to signor orlando can you give me any advise yes my dear boy buy a daily paper the sun or herald and look at the advertisements there may be some prominent business man who is looking out for a boy of your size phil knew of no better way and he followed signor orlando's advice after a frugal breakfast at the bowery restaurant he invested a few pennies in the two papers mentioned and began to go the rounds the first place was in pearl street he entered and was directed to a desk in the front part of the store you advertised for a boy he said we've got one was the brusque reply of course no more was to be said and phil walked out a little dashed at his first rebuff at the next place he found some half a dozen boys waiting and joined the line but the vacancy was filled before his turn came at the next place his appearance seemed to make a good impression and he was asked several questions what is your name philip brent how old are you just sixteen how is your education i have been to school since i was six then you ought to know something have you ever been in a place no sir do you live with your parents no sir i have just come to the city and am lodging in fifth street then you won't do we wish our boys to live with their parents poor phil he had allowed himself to hope that at length he was likely to get a place the abrupt termination of the conversation dispirited him he made three more applications in one of them he again came near succeeding but once more the fact that he did not live with his parents defeated his application it seems to be very hard getting a place thought phil and it must be confessed he felt a little homesick i won't make any more applications to day he decided and being on broadway walked up that busy thoroughfare wondering what the morrow would bring forth it was winter and there was ice on the sidewalk directly in front of phil walked an elderly gentleman whose suit of fine broadcloth and gold spectacles seemed to indicate a person of some prominence and social importance suddenly he set foot on a treacherous piece of ice vainly he strove to keep his equilibrium his arms waving wildly and his gold headed cane falling to the sidewalk he would have fallen backward had not phil observing his danger in time rushed to his assistance chapter viii the house in twelfth street with some difficulty the gentleman righted himself and then phil picked up his cane i hope you are not hurt sir he said i should have been but for you my good boy said the gentleman i am a little shaken by the suddenness of my slipping would you wish me to go with you sir yes if you please i do not perhaps require you but i shall be glad of your company thank you sir do you live in the city yes sir that is i propose to do so i have come here in search of employment phil said this thinking it possible that the old gentleman might exert his influence in his favor are you dependent on what you may earn asked the gentleman regarding him attentively i have a little money sir but when that is gone i shall need to earn something that is no misfortune it is a good thing for a boy to be employed otherwise he is liable to get into mischief at any rate i shall be glad to find work sir have you applied anywhere yet phil gave a little account of his unsuccessful applications and the objections that had been made to him yes yes said the old gentleman thoughtfully more confidence is placed in a boy who lives with his parents the two walked on together until they reached twelfth street it was a considerable walk and phil was surprised that his companion should walk when he could easily have taken a broadway stage but the old gentleman explained this himself i find it does me good he said to spend some time in the open air and even if walking tires me it does me good at twelfth street they turned off i am living with a married niece he said just on the other side of fifth avenue at the door of a handsome four story house with a brown stone front the old gentleman paused and told phil that this was his residence then sir i will bid you good morning said phil no no come in and lunch with me said mr carter hospitably he had by the way mentioned that his name was oliver carter and that he was no longer actively engaged in business but was a silent partner in the firm of which his nephew by marriage was the nominal head thank you sir answered phil he was sure that the invitation was intended to be accepted and he saw no reason why he should not accept it hannah said the old gentleman to the servant who opened the door tell your mistress that i have brought a boy home to dinner with me yes sir answered hannah surveying phil in some surprise come up to my room my young friend said mr carter you may want to prepare for lunch mr carter had two"
