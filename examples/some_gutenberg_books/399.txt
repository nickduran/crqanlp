"1" "intrinsic worth they must be worth several hundred dollars at least then they must be found said adin woods energetically they have evidently been taken by some passenger during the five minutes we were away from our seat were you inquiring about the casket asked a lady sitting opposite yes madam can you give any information about it just after you left your seat the man that sat behind you rose and reaching over for it went to the rear end of the car and got out i wish you had stopped him madam he was so cool about it that i thought he might be a friend of the young gentleman i didn't know him he must have been a thief what was his appearance madam asked the lot agent he was a thin dark complexioned man with side whiskers coming half way down his cheeks and you say he got out of the rear end of the car yes sir he won't get on the train again said the agent turning to rodney he thinks the casket valuable enough to pay him for the interruption of his journey what shall i do then asked rodney feeling helpless and at a loss which way to turn follow him said the agent briefly he will probably stop over in the village a day and resume his journey tomorrow even if i found him i am afraid i shouldn't know how to deal with him then i'll tell you what i'll do i'll stop over with you and help you make it hot for him i've had a spite against thieves ever since i had a valuable overcoat stolen in one of my journeys i shall feel very much obliged to you mr woods but won't it interfere with your business not materially if we succeed in overhauling the rascal i shall feel sufficiently repaid for the small interruption but come on we can't afford to linger here while he is carrying off the plunder i don't know how i can repay you mr woods said rodney gratefully you can buy a lot of me when you get rich enough i will certainly do so though i am afraid it will be a long time first you don't know what good fortune may be in store for you did you notice madam in which direction the thief went yes i was looking out of the window he went over the road to the left that leads to the village you will see mr ropes that i was right about his plans don't call me mr ropes call me rodney i will it don't seem natural to dub a boy mr now rodney follow me the two passengers set out on the road that led to the village they could see the latter easily for it was not more than a mile away he will be surprised to think we have struck his trail so quick said the agent where shall we go first to the hotel if there is one the village seems small yes there are only a few hundred inhabitant probably it is not a place where a traveler would be likely to interrupt his journey unless he had a special object in doing so like our dishonest friend however i think we shall be able to balk his little game ten minutes walk brought them to the village looking about they saw a small hotel just across the way from a neat white chapel follow me said the agent they went into the public room in which there was a small office the book of arrivals was open and adin woods went forward and examined it silently he pointed to a name evidently just written for the ink was scarcely dry this was the name louis wheeler philadelphia this may or may not be his real name said mr woods in a low voice do you wish to register gentlemen asked the clerk we will take dinner and if we decide to stay will register later by the way i recognize this name but it may not be the man i suppose yes the gentleman just registered would you mind describing him he was a tall dark man as near as i can remember and he carried a small casket in his hand yes and a gripsack oh yes said the agent his face lighting up with satisfaction it is the man i mean where is he now in his room did he say how long he intended to stay no sir he said nothing about his plans did he seem specially careful about the casket yes sir he carried that in his hands but let the servant carry up the gripsack my friend said the agent in an impressive tone i am going to surprise you the country clerk looked all curiosity is it about mr wheeler he asked yes the man is a thief he stole the casket which contains valuable jewelry from my young friend here we are here to demand a return of the property or to arrest him is there a policeman within call i can summon a constable do so but don't breathe a word of what i have told you the clerk called a boy in from the street and gave him instructions in a low voice he went at once on his errand and in ten minutes a stout broad shouldered man made his appearance this gentleman sent for you mr barlow said the clerk what can i do for you asked the constable help me to recover stolen property that i will do with pleasure if you will tell me what you want me to do adin woods held a brief conference with the constable then he led the way up stairs followed immediately by rodney while the constable kept a little behind his room is no 9 said the bell boy the agent paused before the door of no 9 and knocked come in said a voice the agent opened the door and entered accompanied by rodney a glance showed that the occupant answered the description given by the lady in the car louis wheeler changed color for he recognized both the agent and rodney what is your business he asked in a tone which he tried to make indifferent that answered woods pointing to the jewel casket on the bureau it looked to him as if wheeler if that was his name had been trying to open it i don't understand then i will try to make things clear to you you have doubtless by accident he emphasized the last word taken from the car a casket belonging to my young friend here you are mistaken sir said wheeler with brazen hardihood that casket belongs to me indeed what does it contain i fail to see how that is any of your business returned wheeler determined if possible to bluff off his visitors i admire your cheek sir i really do but i am too old a traveler to be taken in by such tricks i propose to have that casket well sir you are the most impudent thief and burglar i ever met you break into a gentleman's room and undertake to carry off his private property unless you go out at once i will have you arrested that you can do very readily for i have an officer within call louis wheeler changed color he began to see that the situation was getting serious there is a great mistake here he said i agree with you the agent went to the door and called constable barlow the constable promptly presented himself do you want me sir he asked that depends on this gentleman here if he will peacefully restore to my young friend here yonder jewel casket i am willing to let him go otherwise and he glanced at wheeler significantly perhaps i have made a mistake admitted the thief i had a casket exactly like this possibly i have taken the wrong one i have the key to the casket here said rodney and i can tell you without opening it what it contains what did yours contain asked the agent jewelry answered wheeler shortly what articles never mind i am inclined to think this casket belongs to the boy rodney you can take it and mr wheeler will probably find his where he left it no objection was made and the discomfited thief was left a prey to mortification and disappointment rodney handed a dollar to the constable which that worthy official received with thanks and he and the agent resumed their journey by an afternoon train they saw nothing further of louis wheeler who sent for dinner to be served in his room chapter v a young financial wreck you have been very fortunate in recovering your jewels said the agent i owe it to you replied rodney gratefully well perhaps so if i have rendered you a service i am very glad and i am very glad to have found so good a friend i hope you will let me pay for your ticket to new york it won't be necessary the interruption of our journey won't invalidate the ticket we have an hour later they reached new york what are your plans rodney asked adin woods who by this time had become quite intimate with his young companion i shall call on my guardian and perhaps he may give me some advice as to what i do where would you advise me to go to a hotel no it will be too expensive i know of a plain boarding house on west fourteenth street where you can be accommodated with lodging and two meals breakfast and supper or dinner as we call it here for a dollar a day i shall be glad to go there for the present at least i haven't much money and must find something to do as soon as possible we will both go there and if you don't object we will take a room together that will give us a larger apartment mrs marcy is an old acquaintance of mine and will give you a welcome rodney was glad to accept his companion's proposal they proceeded at once to the boarding house and fortunately found a good room vacant on the third floor mr woods went out in the evening to make a call but rodney was glad to go to bed at nine o'clock the next morning after breakfast rodney consulted his companion as to what he should do with the casket do you want to raise money on it asked the agent no i shall not do this unless i am obliged to have you any idea as to the value of the jewels no then i will take you first to a jeweler in maiden lane a friend of mine who will appraise them afterwards i advise you to deposit the casket at a storage warehouse or get tiffany to keep it for you i will do as you suggest maiden lane is a street largely devoted to jewelers wholesale and retail rodney followed mr woods into a store about midway between broadway and nassau street a pleasant looking man of middle age greeted the agent cordially what can i do for you he asked do you wish to buy a diamond ring for the future mrs woods not much i would like to have you appraise some jewelry belonging to my young friend here the casket was opened and the jeweler examined the contents admiringly this is choice jewelry he said does your friend wish to sell not at present answered rodney when you do give me a call i will treat you fairly you wish me to appraise these articles yes sir if you will it will take me perhaps fifteen minutes the jeweler retired to the back part of the store with the casket in about a quarter of an hour he returned of course i can't give exact figures he said but i value the jewelry at about twelve hundred dollars rodney looked surprised i didn't think it so valuable he said i don't mean that you could sell it for so much but if you wish to dispose of it i will venture to give you eleven hundred thank you if i decide to sell i will certainly come to you now said the agent i advise you on the whole to store the casket with tiffany shall i have to pay storage in advance asked rodney anxiously i think not the value of the jewels will be a sufficient guarantee that storage will be paid rodney accompanied adin woods to the great jewelry store on the corner of fifteenth street and union square and soon transacted his business now you won't have any anxiety as to the safety of the casket said the agent your friend of the train will find it difficult to get hold of the jewels now i shall have to leave you as i have some business to attend to we will meet at supper rodney decided to call at the office of his late guardian benjamin fielding it was in the lower part of the city on his way down town he purchased a copy of a morning paper almost the first article he glanced at proved to be of especial interest to him it was headed skipped to canada rumors have been rife for some time affecting the business standing of mr benjamin fielding the well known commission merchant yesterday it was discovered that he had left the city but where he has gone is unknown it is believed that he is very deeply involved and seeing no way out of his embarrassment has skipped to canada or perhaps taken passage to europe probably his creditors will appoint a committee to look into his affairs and report what can be done later an open letter has been found in mr fielding's desk addressed to his creditors it expresses regret for their losses and promises if his life is spared and fortune favors him to do all in his power to make them good no one doubts mr fielding's integrity and regrets are expressed that he did not remain in the city and help unravel the tangle in which his affairs are involved he is a man of ability and as he is still in the prime of life it may be that he will be able to redeem his promises and pay his debts in full if sufficient time is given him i can get no help or advice from mr fielding thought rodney i am thrown upon my own resources and must fight the battle of life as well as i can alone he got out in front of the astor house as he left the car he soiled his shoes with the mud so characteristic of new york streets shine your boots asked a young arab glancing with a business eye at rodney's spattered shoes rodney accepted his offer not so much because he thought the blacking would last as for the opportunity of questioning the free and independent young citizen who was doing what he hoped to do that is making a living for himself is business good with you asked rodney it ought to be with the street in this condition yes me and de street commissioner is in league together he makes business good for me and do you pay him a commission asked rodney smiling i can't tell no official secrets it might be bad for me you are an original genius am i i hope you ain't callin me names oh no i am only paying you a compliment what is your name mike flynn were do you live mike at the lodge i suppose you mean at the newsboys lodge yes how much do you have to pay there six cents for lodgin and six cents for supper and breakfast that is six cents for each yes you ain't comin to live there are you asked mike i don't know i may have to you're jokin what makes you think i am joking because you're a swell look at them clo'es i have a good suit of clothes to be sure but i haven't much money you are better off than i am how's that asked mike incredulously you've got work to do and i am earning nothing if you've got money enough to buy a box and brush you can go in with me i don't think i should like it mike it would spoil my clothes and i am afraid i wouldn't have money enough to buy others i keep my dress suit at home the one i wear to parties haven't you got any father or mother mike how does it happen that you are living in new york alone my farder is dead and me mudder she married a man wot ain't no good he'd bate me till i couldn't stand it so i just run away where does your mother live in albany some time when you earn money enough you can ask her to come here and live with you they don't take women at the lodge no i suppose not said rodney smiling besides she's got two little girls by her new husband and she wouldn't want to leave them by this time the shine was completed and rodney paid mike if i ever come to the lodge i'll ask for you he said where do you live now i'm just staying at a place on fourteenth street but i can't afford to stay there long for they charge a dollar a day geewholliker that would bust me and make me a financial wreck as the papers say how did you lose your fortune and get reduced to blacking boots asked rodney jocosely i got scooped out of it in wall street answered mike jay gould cleaned me out and i suppose now he has added your fortune to his you've hit it boss well good day mike i'll see you again some day all right i'm in my office all de mornin chapter vi an impudent adventurer while rodney was talking with mike flynn he was an object of attention to a man who stood near the corner of barclay street and was ostensibly looking in at the window of the drug store as rodney turned away he recognized him at once as his enterprising fellow traveler who had taken possession of the casket of jewels he did not care to keep up an acquaintance with him and started to cross the street but the other came forward smiling and with a nod said i believe you are the young man i met yesterday in the cars and afterwards at kentville yes sir i just wanted to tell you that i had got back my jewel box the one for which i mistook yours indeed said rodney who did not believe a word the fellow said quite an amusing mistake i made it might have proved serious to me very true as i shouldn't have known where to find you to restore your property i don't think that would have troubled you much thought rodney where did you find your box he asked in the car that is the conductor picked it up and left it at the depot for me where are you staying here in the city at the astor house no i have found a boarding house on west fourteenth street if it is a good place i should like to go there what is the number i can't recall it though i could find it answered rodney with reserve for he had no wish to have his railroad acquaintance in the house is the gentleman who was traveling with you there also yes sir he is a very pleasant gentleman though he misjudged me ha ha my friends will be very much amused when i tell them that i was taken for a thief why i venture to say that my box is more valuable than yours very likely said rodney coldly good morning good morning i hope we may meet again rodney nodded but he could not in sincerity echo the wish he was now confronted by a serious problem he had less than ten dollars in his pocketbook and this would soon be swallowed up by the necessary expenses of life in a large city what would he do when that was gone it was clear that he must go to work as soon as possible if his guardian had remained in the city probably through his influence a situation might have been secured now nothing was to be looked for in that quarter he bought a morning paper and looked over the want column he found two places within a short distance of the astor house and called at each one was in a railroad office my boy said the manager a pleasant looking man the place was taken hours since you don't seem to get up very early in the morning i could get up at any hour that was necessary replied rodney but i have only just made up my mind to apply for a position you won't meet with any luck today it is too late get up bright and early tomorrow morning buy a paper and make early application for any place that strikes you as desirable thank you sir i am sure your advice is good if you had been the first to call here i should have taken you i like your appearance better than that of the boy i have selected thank you sir this boy may not prove satisfactory call in six days just before his week expires and if there is likely to be a vacancy i will let you know thank you sir you are very kind i always sympathize with boys i have two boys of my own this conversation quite encouraged rodney it seemed to promise success in the future if he had probably impressed one man he might be equally fortunate with another it was about half past twelve when he passed through nassau street all at once his arm was grasped and a cheery voice said where are you going rodney mr woods he exclaimed with pleased recognition yes it's your old friend woods you are not the only railroad friend i have met this morning who was the other the gentleman who obligingly took care of my jewel box for a short time you don't mean to say you have met him where did you come across him in front of the astor house almost two hours since did you speak to him he spoke to me you will be glad to hear that he has recovered his own casket of jewels adin woods smiled he must think you are easily imposed upon he said to believe any such story anything more he said his friends would be very much surprised to hear that he had been suspected of theft so he wanted to clear himself with you yes he asked where i was staying i hope you didn't tell him i only said i was at a boarding house on west fourteenth street but didn't mention the number he thinks you have the casket with you and that he may get possession of it it is well that you stored it at tiffany's i think so now i have no anxiety about it do you think he will find out where we live probably as you gave him a clew but rodney it is about lunch time and i confess i have an appetite come and lunch with me but i am afraid mr woods i shall not be able to return the compliment there is no occasion for it i feel in good humor this morning i have sold one lot and have hopes of disposing of another the one lot pays me a commission of twenty dollars i wish i could make twenty dollars in a week sometimes i only sell one lot in a week it isn't like a regular business it is precarious still take the year through and i make a pretty good income come in here we can get a good lunch here and he led the way into a modest restaurant not far from the site of the old post office which will be remembered by those whose residence in new york dates back twenty years or more now we will have a nice lunch said the agent i hope you can do justice to it i generally can responded rodney smiling i am seldom troubled with a poor appetite ditto for me now what have you been doing this morning looking for a place with what success pretty good if i had only been earlier rodney told the story of his application to the manager of the railroad office you will know better next time i think you'll succeed i did when i came to new york at the age of twenty two i had only fifty dollars that small sum had to last me twelve weeks you can judge that i didn't live on the fat of the land during that time i couldn't often eat at delmonico's even beefsteak john's would have been too expensive for me however those old days are over the next day and the two following rodney went about the city making application for positions but every place seemed full on the third day mr woods said i shall have to leave you for a week or more rodney where are you going to philadelphia there's a man there who is a capitalist and likes land investments i am going to visit him and hope to sell him several lots he once lived in this city so he won't object to new york investments i hope you will succeed mr woods i think if you are going away i had better give up the room and find cheaper accommodations i am getting near the end of my money you are right it is best to be prudent that evening rodney found a room which he could rent for two dollars a week he estimated that by economy he could get along for fifty cents a day for his eating and that would be a decided saving he was just leaving the house the next morning gripsack in hand when on the steps he met louis wheeler his acquaintance of the train where are you going asked wheeler i am leaving this house i have hired a room elsewhere wheeler's countenance fell and he looked dismayed why i have just taken a room here for a week he said you will find it a good place but i wouldn't have come here if i hadn't thought i should have company i ought to feel complimented rodney was convinced that wheeler had come in the hopes of stealing the casket of jewels a second time and he felt amused at the fellow's discomfiture you haven't got your jewel box with you no i can take that another time then it's still in the house thought wheeler with satisfaction it won't be my fault if i don't get it in my hands well good morning he said come around and call on me thank you chapter vii at the newsboy's lodging house within a week rodney had spent all his money with the exception of about fifty cents he had made every effort to obtain a place but without success boys born and bred in new york have within my observation tried for months to secure a position in vain so it is not surprising that rodney who was a stranger proved equally unsuccessful though naturally hopeful rodney became despondent there seems to be no place for me he said to himself when i was at boarding school i had no idea how difficult it is for a boy to earn a living he had one resource he could withdraw the box of jewels from tiffany's and sell some article that it contained but this he had a great objection to doing one thing was evident however he must do something his friend the lot agent was out of town and he hardly knew whom to advise with at last mike flynn the friendly bootblack whose acquaintance he had made in front of the astor house occurred to him mike humble as he was was better off than himself moreover he was a new york boy and knew more about hustling than rodney did so he sought out mike in his office good morning mike said rodney as the bootblack was brushing off a customer oh its you rodney said mike smiling with evident pleasure how you're gettin on not at all that's bad can i help you just say the word and i'll draw a check for you on the park bank is that where you keep your money it's one of my banks you don't think i'd put all my spondulics in one bank do you i won't trouble you to draw a check this morning i only want to ask some advice i've got plenty of that i haven't been able to get anything to do and i have only fifty cents left i can't go on like that that's so i've got to give up my room on fourteenth street i can't pay for it any longer do you think i could get in at the lodge yes i'll introduce you to mr o'connor when shall i meet you at five o'clock we'll be in time"
