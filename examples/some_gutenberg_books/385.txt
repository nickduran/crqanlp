"1" "left field fence wehying tried to make him too anxious but it was in vain halloran was implacable with two strikes and three balls he hit straight down to white and was out the ball had been so sharp that neither runner on base had a chance to advance two men out two on base stars wanting three runs to tie scott a weak batter at the plate the situation was disheartening yet there sat delaney shot through and through with some vital compelling force he saw only victory and when the very first ball pitched to scott hit him on the leg giving him his base delaney got to his feet unsteady and hoarse bases full reddie ray up three runs to tie delaney looked at reddie and reddie looked at delaney the manager's face was pale intent with a little smile the player had eyes of fire a lean bulging jaw and the hands he reached for his bat clutched like talons reddie i knew it was waitin for you said delaney his voice ringing break up the game after all this was only a baseball game and perhaps from the fans viewpoint a poor game at that but the moment when that lithe redhaired athlete toed the plate was a beautiful one the long crash from the bleachers the steady cheer from the grand stand proved that it was not so much the game that mattered wehying had shot his bolt he was tired yet he made ready for a final effort it seemed that passing reddie ray on balls would have been a wise play at that juncture but no pitcher probably would have done it with the bases crowded and chances of course against the batter clean and swift reddie leaped at the first pitched ball ping for a second no one saw the hit then it gleamed a terrific drive low along the ground like a bounding bullet straight at babcock in right field it struck his hands and glanced viciously away to roll toward the fence thunder broke loose from the stands reddie ray was turning first base beyond first base he got into his wonderful stride some runners run with a consistent speed the best they can make for a given distance but this trained sprinter gathered speed as he ran he was no short stepping runner his strides were long they gave an impression of strength combined with fleetness he had the speed of a race horse but the trimness the raciness the delicate legs were not characteristic of him like the wind he turned second so powerful that his turn was short all at once there came a difference in his running it was no longer beautiful the grace was gone it was now fierce violent his momentum was running him off his legs he whirled around third base and came hurtling down the homestretch his face was convulsed his eyes were wild his arms and legs worked in a marvelous muscular velocity he seemed a demon a flying streak he overtook and ran down the laboring scott who had almost reached the plate the park seemed full of shrill piercing strife it swelled reached a highest pitch sustained that for a long moment and then declined my gawd exclaimed delaney as he fell back wasn't that a finish didn't i tell you to watch them redheads the rube it was the most critical time i had yet experienced in my career as a baseball manager and there was more than the usual reason why i must pull the team out a chance for a business deal depended upon the good will of the stockholders of the worcester club on the outskirts of the town was a little cottage that i wanted to buy and this depended upon the business deal my whole future happiness depended upon the little girl i hoped to install in that cottage coming to the worcester eastern league team i had found a strong aggregation and an enthusiastic following i really had a team with pennant possibilities providence was a strong rival but i beat them three straight in the opening series set a fast pace and likewise set worcester baseball mad the eastern league clubs were pretty evenly matched still i continued to hold the lead until misfortune overtook me gregg smashed an umpire and had to be laid off mullaney got spiked while sliding and was out of the game ashwell sprained his ankle and hirsch broke a finger radbourne my great pitcher hurt his arm on a cold day and he could not get up his old speed stringer who had batted three hundred and seventy one and led the league the year before struck a bad spell and could not hit a barn door handed up to him then came the slump the team suddenly let down went to pieces played ball that would have disgraced an amateur nine it was a trying time here was a great team strong everywhere a little hard luck had dug up a slump and now day by day the team dropped in the race when we reached the second division the newspapers flayed us worcester would never stand for a second division team baseball admirers reporters fans especially the fans are fickle the admirers quit the reporters grilled us and the fans though they stuck to the games with that barnacle like tenacity peculiar to them made life miserable for all of us i saw the pennant slowly fading and the successful season and the business deal and the cottage and milly but when i thought of her i just could not see failure something must be done but what i was at the end of my wits when jersey city beat us that saturday eleven to two shoving us down to fifth place with only a few percentage points above the fall river team i grew desperate and locking my players in the dressing room i went after them they had lain down on me and needed a jar i told them so straight and flat and being bitter i did not pick and choose my words and fellows i concluded you've got to brace a little more of this and we can't pull out i tell you you're a championship team we had that pennant cinched a few cuts and sprains and hard luck and you all quit you lay down i've been patient i've plugged for you never a man have i fined or thrown down but now i'm at the end of my string i'm out to fine you now and i'll release the first man who shows the least yellow i play no more substitutes crippled or not you guys have got to get in the game i waited to catch my breath and expected some such outburst as managers usually get from criticized players but not a word then i addressed some of them personally gregg your lay off ends today you play monday mullaney you've drawn your salary for two weeks with that spiked foot if you can't run on it well all right but i put it up to your good faith i've played the game and i know it's hard to run on a sore foot but you can do it ashwell your ankle is lame i know now can you run sure i can i'm not a quitter i'm ready to go in replied ashwell raddy how about you i said turning to my star twirler connelly i've seen as fast a team in as bad a rut and yet pull out returned radbourne we're about due for the brace when it comes look out as for me well my arm isn't right but it's acting these warm days in a way that tells me it will be soon it's been worked too hard can't you get another pitcher i'm not knocking herne or cairns they're good for their turn but we need a new man to help out and he must be a crackerjack if we're to get back to the lead where on earth can i find such a pitcher i shouted almost distracted well that's up to you replied radbourne up to me it certainly was and i cudgeled my brains for inspiration after i had given up in hopelessness it came in the shape of a notice i read in one of the papers it was a brief mention of an amateur worcester ball team being shut out in a game with a rickettsville nine rickettsville played sunday ball which gave me an opportunity to look them over it took some train riding and then a journey by coach to get to rickettsville i mingled with the crowd of talking rustics there was only one little bleachers and this was loaded to the danger point with the feminine adherents of the teams most of the crowd centered alongside and back of the catcher's box i edged in and got a position just behind the stone that served as home plate hunting up a player in this way was no new thing to me i was too wise to make myself known before i had sized up the merits of my man so before the players came upon the field i amused myself watching the rustic fans and listening to them then a roar announced the appearance of the rickettsville team and their opponents who wore the name of spatsburg on their canton flannel shirts the uniforms of these country amateurs would have put a philadelphia mummer's parade to the blush at least for bright colors but after one amused glance i got down to the stern business of the day and that was to discover a pitcher and failing that baseball talent of any kind never shall i forget my first glimpse of the rickettsville twirler he was far over six feet tall and as lean as a fence rail he had a great shock of light hair a sunburned sharp featured face wide sloping shoulders and arms enormously long he was about as graceful and had about as much of a baseball walk as a crippled cow he's a rube i ejaculated in disgust and disappointment but when i had seen him throw one ball to his catcher i grew as keen as a fox on a scent what speed he had i got round closer to him and watched him with sharp eager eyes he was a giant to be sure he was lean rawboned as a horse but powerful what won me at once was his natural easy swing he got the ball away with scarcely any effort i wondered what he could do when he brought the motion of his body into play bub what might be the pitcher's name i asked of a boy huh mister his name might be dennis but it ain't huh replied this country youngster evidently my question had thrown some implication upon this particular player i reckon you be a stranger in these parts said a pleasant old fellow his name's hurtle whitaker hurtle whit fer short he hain't lost a gol darned game this summer no sir ee never pitched any before nuther hurtle what a remarkably fitting name rickettsville chose the field and the game began hurtle swung with his easy motion the ball shot across like a white bullet it was a strike and so was the next and the one succeeding he could not throw anything but strikes and it seemed the spatsburg players could not make even a foul outside of hurtle's work the game meant little to me and i was so fascinated by what i saw in him that i could hardly contain myself after the first few innings i no longer tried to i yelled with the rickettsville rooters the man was a wonder a blind baseball manager could have seen that he had a straight ball shoulder high level as a stretched string and fast he had a jump ball which he evidently worked by putting on a little more steam and it was the speediest thing i ever saw in the way of a shoot he had a wide sweeping outcurve wide as the blade of a mowing scythe and he had a drop an unhittable drop he did not use it often for it made his catcher dig too hard into the dirt but whenever he did i glowed all over once or twice he used an underhand motion and sent in a ball that fairly swooped up it could not have been hit with a board and best of all dearest to the manager's heart he had control every ball he threw went over the plate he could not miss it to him that plate was as big as a house what a find already i had visions of the long looked for brace of my team and of the pennant and the little cottage and the happy light of a pair of blue eyes what he meant to me that country pitcher hurtle he shut out the spatsburg team without a run or a hit or even a scratch then i went after him i collared him and his manager and there surrounded by the gaping players i bought him and signed him before any of them knew exactly what i was about i did not haggle i asked the manager what he wanted and produced the cash i asked hurtle what he wanted doubled his ridiculously modest demand paid him in advance and got his name to the contract then i breathed a long deep breath the first one for weeks something told me that with hurtle's signature in my pocket i had the eastern league pennant then i invited all concerned down to the rickettsville hotel we made connections at the railroad junction and reached worcester at midnight in time for a good sleep i took the silent and backward pitcher to my hotel in the morning we had breakfast together i showed him about worcester and then carried him off to the ball grounds i had ordered morning practice and as morning practice is not conducive to the cheerfulness of ball players i wanted to reach the dressing room a little late when we arrived all the players had dressed and were out on the field i had some difficulty in fitting hurtle with a uniform and when i did get him dressed he resembled a two legged giraffe decked out in white shirt gray trousers and maroon stockings spears my veteran first baseman and captain of the team was the first to see us sufferin umpires yelled spears here you micks look at this con's got with him what a yell burst from that sore and disgruntled bunch of ball tossers my players were a grouchy set in practice anyway and today they were in their meanest mood hey beanpole get on to the stilts con where did you find that i cut short their chaffing with a sharp order for batting practice regular line up now no monkey biz i went on take two cracks and a bunt here hurtle i said drawing him toward the pitcher's box don't pay any attention to their talk that's only the fun of ball players go in now and practice a little lam a few over hurtle's big freckled hands closed nervously over the ball i thought it best not to say more to him for he had a rather wild look i remembered my own stage fright upon my first appearance in fast company besides i knew what my amiable players would say to him i had a secret hope and belief that presently they would yell upon the other side of the fence mccall my speedy little left fielder led off at bat he was full of ginger chipper as a squirrel sarcastic as only a tried ball player can be put em over slats put em over he called viciously swinging his ash hurtle stood stiff and awkward in the box and seemed to be rolling something in his mouth then he moved his arm we all saw the ball dart down straight that is all of us except mccall because if he had seen it he might have jumped out of the way crack the ball hit him on the shin mccall shrieked we all groaned that crack hurt all of us any baseball player knows how it hurts to be hit on the shinbone mccall waved his bat madly rube rube rube he yelled then and there hurtle got the name that was to cling to him all his baseball days mccall went back to the plate red in the face mad as a hornet and he sidestepped every time rube pitched a ball he never even ticked one and retired in disgust limping and swearing ashwell was next he did not show much alacrity on rube's first pitch down went ashwell flat in the dust the ball whipped the hair of his head rube was wild and i began to get worried ashwell hit a couple of measly punks but when he assayed a bunt the gang yelled derisively at him what's he got the old familiar cry of batters when facing a new pitcher stringer went up bold and formidable that was what made him the great hitter he was he loved to bat he would have faced anybody he would have faced even a cannon new curves were a fascination to him and speed for him in his own words was apple pie in this instance surprise was in store for stringer rube shot up the straight one then the wide curve then the drop stringer missed them all struck out fell down ignominiously it was the first time he had fanned that season and he looked dazed we had to haul him away i called off the practice somewhat worried about rube's showing and undecided whether or not to try him in the game that day so i went to radbourne who had quietly watched rube while on the field raddy was an old pitcher and had seen the rise of a hundred stars i told him about the game at rickettsville and what i thought of rube and frankly asked his opinion con you've made the find of your life said raddy quietly and deliberately this from radbourne was not only comforting it was relief hope assurance i avoided spears for it would hardly be possible for him to regard the rube favorably and i kept under cover until time to show up at the grounds buffalo was on the ticket for that afternoon and the bisons were leading the race and playing in topnotch form i went into the dressing room while the players were changing suits because there was a little unpleasantness that i wanted to spring on them before we got on the field boys i said curtly hurtle works today cut loose now and back him up i had to grab a bat and pound on the wall to stop the uproar did you mutts hear what i said well it goes not a word now i'm handling this team we're in bad i know but it's my judgment to pitch hurtle rube or no rube and it's up to you to back us that's the baseball of it grumbling and muttering they passed out of the dressing room i knew ball players if hurtle should happen to show good form they would turn in a flash rube tagged reluctantly in their rear he looked like a man in a trance i wanted to speak encouragingly to him but raddy told me to keep quiet it was inspiring to see my team practice that afternoon there had come a subtle change i foresaw one of those baseball climaxes that can be felt and seen but not explained whether it was a hint of the hoped for brace or only another flash of form before the final let down i had no means to tell but i was on edge carter the umpire called out the batteries and i sent my team into the field when that long lanky awkward rustic started for the pitcher's box i thought the bleachers would make him drop in his tracks the fans were sore on any one those days and a new pitcher was bound to hear from them where oh where oh where connelly's found another dead one scarecrow look at his pants pad his legs then the inning began and things happened rube had marvelous speed but he could not find the plate he threw the ball the second he got it he hit men walked men and fell all over himself trying to field bunts the crowd stormed and railed and hissed the bisons pranced round the bases and yelled like indians finally they retired with eight runs eight runs enough to win two games i could not have told how it happened i was sick and all but crushed still i had a blind dogged faith in the big rustic i believed he had not got started right it was a trying situation i called spears and raddy to my side and talked fast it's all off now let the dinged rube take his medicine growled spears don't take him out said raddy he's not shown at all what's in him the blamed hayseed is up in the air he's crazy he doesn't know what he's doing i tell you con he may be scared to death but he's dead in earnest suddenly i recalled the advice of the pleasant old fellow at rickettsville spears you're the captain i said sharply go after the rube wake him up tell him he can't pitch call him pogie that's a name that stirs him up well i'll be dinged he looks it replied spears here rube get off the bench come here rube lurched toward us he seemed to be walking in his sleep his breast was laboring and he was dripping with sweat who ever told you that you could pitch asked spears genially he was master at baseball ridicule i had never yet seen the youngster who could stand his badinage he said a few things then wound up with come now you cross between a hayrack and a wagon tongue get sore and do something pitch if you can show us do you hear you tow headed pogie rube jumped as if he had been struck his face flamed red and his little eyes turned black he shoved his big fist under capt spears nose mister i'll lick you fer thet after the game and i'll show you dog goned well how i can pitch good exclaimed raddy and i echoed his word then i went to the bench and turned my attention to the game some one told me that mccall had made a couple of fouls and after waiting for two strikes and three balls had struck out ashwell had beat out a bunt in his old swift style and stringer was walking up to the plate on the moment it was interesting even in a losing game to see stringer go to bat we all watched him as we had been watching him for weeks expecting him to break his slump with one of the drives that had made him famous stringer stood to the left side of the plate and i could see the bulge of his closely locked jaw he swung on the first pitched ball with the solid rap we all rose to watch that hit the ball lined first then soared and did not begin to drop till it was far beyond the right field fence for an instant we were all still so were the bleachers stringer had broken his slump with the longest drive ever made on the grounds the crowd cheered as he trotted around the bases behind ashwell two runs con how'd you like that drive he asked me with a bright gleam in his eyes o h a beaut i replied incoherently the players on the bench were all as glad as i was henley flew out to left mullaney smashed a two bagger to right then gregg hit safely but mullaney in trying to score on the play was out at the plate four hits i tell you fellows something's coming off said raddy now if only rube what a difference there was in that long rustic he stalked into the box unmindful of the hooting crowd and grimly faced schultz the first batter up for the bisons this time rube was deliberate and where he had not swung before he now got his body and arm into full motion the ball came in like a glint of light schultz looked surprised the umpire called strike wow yelled the buffalo coacher rube sped up the sidewheeler and schultz reached wide to meet it and failed the third was the lightning drop straight over the plate the batter poked weakly at it then carl struck out and manning following did likewise three of the best hitters in the eastern retired on nine strikes that was no fluke i knew what it meant and i sat there hugging myself with the hum of something joyous in my ears gregg had a glow on his sweaty face oh but say boys take a tip from me the rube's a world beater raddy knew it he sized up that swing and now i know it get wise you its when old spears pasted a single through shortstop the buffalo manager took clary out of the box and put in vane their best pitcher bogart advanced the runner to second but was thrown out on the play then rube came up he swung a huge bat and loomed over the bison's twirler rube had the look of a hitter he seemed to be holding himself back from walking right into the ball and he hit one high and far away the fast carl could not get under it though he made a valiant effort spears scored and rube's long strides carried him to third the cold crowd in the stands came to life even the sore bleachers opened up mccall dumped a slow teaser down the line a hit that would easily have scored rube but he ran a little way then stopped tried to get back and was easily touched out ashwell's hard chance gave the bison's shortstop an error and stringer came up with two men on bases stringer hit a foul over the right field fence and the crowd howled then he hit a hard long drive straight into the centerfielder's hands con i don't know what to think but ding me if we ain't hittin the ball said spears then to his players a little more of that and we're back in our old shape all in a minute at em now rube you dinged old pogie pitch rube toed the rubber wrapped his long brown fingers round the ball stepped out as he swung and zing that inning he unloosed a few more kinks in his arm and he tried some new balls upon the bisons but whatever he used and wherever he put them the result was the same they cut the plate and the bisons were powerless that inning marked the change in my team they had come hack the hoodoo had vanished the championship worcester team was itself again the bisons were fighting too but rube had them helpless when they did hit a ball one of my infielders snapped it up no chances went to the outfield i sat there listening to my men and reveled in a moment that i had long prayed for now you're pitching some rube another strike get him a board called ashwell ding em rube ding em came from capt spears speed oh no yelled bogart at third base it's all off rube it's all off all off so with the wonderful pitching of an angry rube the worcester team came into its own again i sat through it all without another word without giving a signal in a way i realized the awakening of the bleachers and heard the pound of feet and the crash but it was the spirit of my team that thrilled me next to that the work of my new find absorbed me i gloated over his easy deceiving swing i rose out of my seat when he threw that straight fast ball swift as a bullet true as a plumb line and when those hard hitting sure bunting bisons chopped in vain at the wonderful drop i choked back a wild yell for rube meant the world to me that day in the eighth the score was 8 to 6 the bisons had one scratch hit to their credit but not a runner had got beyond first base again rube held them safely one man striking out another fouling out and the third going out on a little fly crash crash crash crash the bleachers were making up for many games in which they could not express their riotous feelings it's a cinch we'll win yelled a fan with a voice rube was the first man up in our half of the ninth and his big bat lammed the first ball safe over second base the crowd hungry for victory got to their feet and stayed upon their feet calling cheering for runs it was the moment for me to get in the game and i leaped up strung like a wire and white hot with inspiration i sent spears to the coaching box with orders to make rube run on the"
