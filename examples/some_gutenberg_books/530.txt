"1" "he was likely to have with mrs crawford but he was acting for carl and his feelings of friendship were strong so he walked beside dr crawford till they reached the tasteful dwelling occupied as a residence by carl and his father how happy carl could be here if he had a stepmother like mine gilbert thought they went up to the front door which was opened for them by a servant jane is mrs crawford in asked the doctor no sir not just now she went to the village to do some shopping is peter in no sir then you will have to wait till they return can't i go up to carl's room and be packing his things yes i think you may i don't think mrs crawford would object good heavens hasn't the man a mind of his own thought gilbert jane you may show this young gentleman up to master carl's room and give him the key of his trunk he is going to pack his clothes when is master carl coming back asked jane i i don't know i think he will be away for a time i wish it was peter instead of him said jane in a low voice only audible to gilbert she showed gilbert the way upstairs while the doctor went to his study are you a friend of master carl's asked jane as soon as they were alone yes jane and where is he at my house is he goin to stay there for a short time he wants to go out into the world and make his own living and no wonder poor boy it's hard times he had here didn't mrs crawford treat him well asked gilbert with curiosity is it trate him well she was a jawin an a jawin him from mornin till night ugh but she's an ugly cr'atur how about peter he's just as bad the m'anest bye i iver set eyes on it would do me good to see him flogged she chatted a little longer with gilbert helping him to find carl's clothes when suddenly a shrill voice was heard calling her from below shure it's the madam said jane shrugging her shoulders i expect she's in a temper and she rose from her knees and hurried downstairs chapter v carl's stepmother five minutes later as gilbert was closing the trunk jane reappeared the doctor and mrs crawford would like to see you downstairs she said gilbert followed jane into the library where dr crawford and his wife were seated he looked with interest at the woman who had made home so disagreeable to carl and was instantly prejudiced against her she was light complexioned with very light brown hair cold gray eyes and a disagreeable expression which seemed natural to her my dear said the doctor this is the young man who has come from carl mrs crawford surveyed gilbert with an expression by no means friendly what is your name she asked gilbert vance did carl crawford send you here no i volunteered to come did he tell you that he was disobedient and disrespectful to me no he told me that you treated him so badly that he was unwilling to live in the same house with you answered gilbert boldly well upon my word exclaimed mrs crawford fanning herself vigorously dr crawford did you hear that yes and what do you think of it well i think you may have been too hard upon carl too hard why then did he not treat me respectfully this boy seems inclined to be impertinent i answered your questions madam said gilbert coldly i suppose you side with your friend carl i certainly do mrs crawford bit her lip what is the object of your coming does carl wish to return i thought dr crawford might have told you carl wants his clothes sent to him said the doctor he only carried a few with him i shall not consent to it he deserves no favors at our hands this was too much even for dr crawford you go too far mrs crawford he said i am sensible of the boy's faults but i certainly will not allow his clothes to be withheld from him oh well spoil him if you choose said the lady sullenly take his part against your wife i have never done that but i will not allow him to be defrauded of his clothes i have no more to say said mrs crawford her eyes snapping she was clearly mortified at her failure to carry her point do you wish the trunk to be sent to your house asked the doctor yes sir i have packed the clothes and locked the trunk i should like to examine it before it goes put in mrs crawford spitefully why to make sure that nothing has been put in that does not belong to carl do you mean to accuse me of stealing madam demanded gilbert indignantly mrs crawford tossed her head i don't know anything about you she replied dr crawford am i to open the trunk asked gilbert no answered the doctor with unwonted decision i hate that boy he has twice subjected me to mortification thought mrs crawford you know very well she said turning to her husband that i have grounds for my request i blush to mention it but i have reason to believe that your son took a wallet containing twenty five dollars from my bureau drawer i deny it said gilbert what do you know about it i should like to ask sneered mrs crawford i know that carl is an honorable boy incapable of theft and at this moment has but thirty seven cents in his possession so far as you know if the money has really disappeared madam you had better ask your own boy about it this is insufferable exclaimed mrs crawford her light eyes emitting angry flashes who dares to say that peter took the wallet she went on rising to her feet there was an unexpected reply jane entered the room at this moment to ask a question i say so ma'am she rejoined what ejaculated mrs crawford with startling emphasis i didn't mean to say anything about it till i found you were charging it on master carl i saw peter open your bureau drawer take out the wallet and put it in his pocket it's a lie said mrs crawford hoarsely it's the truth though i suppose you don't want to believe it if you want to know what he did with the money ask him how much he paid for the gold ring he bought of the jeweler down at the village you are a spy a base dishonorable spy cried mrs crawford i won't say what you are ma'am to bring false charges against master carl and i wonder the doctor will believe them leave the house directly you hussy shrieked mrs crawford if i do i wonder who'll get the dinner remarked jane not at all disturbed i won't stay here to be insulted said the angry lady dr crawford you might have spirit enough to defend your wife she flounced out of the room not waiting for a reply leaving the doctor dazed and flurried i hope sir you are convinced now that carl did not take mrs crawford's money said gilbert i told you it was probably peter are you sure of what you said jane asked the doctor yes sir i saw peter take the wallet with my own eyes it is his mother's money and they must settle it between them i am glad carl did not take it really this has been a very unpleasant scene i am sorry for my part in it carl is my friend and i feel that i ought to stand up for his rights remarked gilbert certainly certainly that is right but you see how i am placed i see that this is no place for carl if you will allow me i will send an expressman for the trunk and take it with me to the station yes i see no objection i i would invite you to dinner but mrs crawford seems to be suffering from a nervous attack and it might not be pleasant i agree with you sir just then peter entered the room and looked at gilbert with surprise and wrath remembering his recent discomfiture at the hands of the young visitor my stepson peter announced dr crawford peter and i have met before said gilbert smiling what are you here for asked peter rudely not to see you answered gilbert turning from him my mother'll have something to say to you went on peter significantly she will have something to say to you retorted gilbert she has found out who stole her money peter's face turned scarlet instantly and he left the room hurriedly perhaps i ought not to have said that dr crawford added gilbert apologetically but i dislike that boy very much and couldn't help giving him as good as he sent it is all very unpleasant responded dr crawford peevishly i don't see why i can't live in peace and tranquility i won't intrude upon you any longer said gilbert if you will kindly tell me whether you will consent to make carl a small weekly allowance i can't say now i want time to think give me your address and i will write to carl in your care very well sir gilbert left the house and made arrangements to have carl's trunk called for it accompanied him on the next train to warren chapter vi mrs crawford's letter how did you like my stepmother asked carl when gilbert returned in the afternoon she's a daisy answered gilbert shrugging his shoulders i don't think i ever saw a more disagreeable woman do you blame me for leaving home i only wonder you have been able to stay so long i had a long conversation with your father mrs crawford has made a different man of him i should have no trouble in getting along with him if there was no one to come between us he gave me this for you said gilbert producing the ten dollar bill did my stepmother know of his sending it no she was opposed to sending your trunk but your father said emphatically you should have it i am glad he showed that much spirit i have some hopes that he will make you an allowance of a few dollars a week that would make me all right but i don't expect it you will probably hear from your father to morrow or next day so you will have to make yourself contented a little longer i hope you are not very homesick mr crawford said julia coquettishly i would ask nothing better than to stay here permanently rejoined carl earnestly this is a real home i have met with more kindness here than in six months at my own home you have one staunch friend at home said gilbert you don't allude to peter so far as i can judge he hates you like poison i mean jane yes jane is a real friend she has been in the family for ten years she was a favorite with my own mother and feels an interest in me by the way your stepmother's charge that you took a wallet containing money from her drawer has been disproved by jane she saw peter abstracting the money and so informed mrs crawford i am not at all surprised peter is mean enough to steal or do anything else what did my stepmother say she was very angry and threatened to discharge jane but as no one would be left to attend to the dinner i presume she is likely to stay i ought to be forming some plan said carl thoughtfully wait till you hear from home julia will see that your time is well filled up till then dismiss all care and enjoy yourself while you may this seemed to be sensible advice and carl followed it in the evening some young people were invited in and there was a round of amusements that made carl forget that he was an exile from home with very dubious prospects you are all spoiling me he said as gilbert and he went upstairs to bed i am beginning to understand the charms of home to go out into the world from here will be like taking a cold shower bath never forget carl that you will be welcome back whenever you feel like coming said gilbert laying his band affectionately on carl's shoulder we all like you here thank you old fellow i appreciate the kindness i have received here but i must strike out for myself how do you feel about it carl i hope for the best i am young strong and willing to work there must be an opening for me somewhere the next morning just after breakfast a letter arrived for carl mailed at edgewood center is it from your father asked gilbert no it is in the handwriting of my stepmother i can guess from that that it contains no good news he opened the letter and as he read it his face expressed disgust and annoyance read it gilbert he said handing him the open sheet this was the missive carl crawford as your father has a nervous attack brought on by your misconduct he has authorized me to write to you as you are but sixteen he could send for you and have you forcibly brought back but deems it better for you to follow your own course and suffer the punishment of your obstinate and perverse conduct the boy whom you sent here proved a fitting messenger he seems if possible to be even worse than yourself he was very impertinent to me and made a brutal and unprovoked attack on my poor boy peter whose devotion to your father and myself forms an agreeable contrast to your studied disregard of our wishes your friend had the assurance to ask for a weekly allowance for you while a voluntary exile from the home where you have been only too well treated in other words you want to be paid for your disobedience even if your father were weak enough to think of complying with this extraordinary request i should do my best to dissuade him small doubt of that said carl bitterly in my sorrow for your waywardness i am comforted by the thought that peter is too good and conscientious ever to follow your example while you are away he will do his utmost to make up to your father for his disappointment in you that you may grow wise in time and turn at length from the error of your ways is the earnest hope of your stepmother anastasia crawford it makes me sick to read such a letter as that gilbert said carl and to have that sneak and thief as he turned out to be peter set up as a model for me is a little too much i never knew there were such women in the world returned gilbert i can understand your feelings perfectly after my interview of yesterday she thinks even worse of you than of me said carl with a faint smile i have no doubt peter shares her sentiments i didn't make many friends in your family it must be confessed you did me a service gilbert and i shall not soon forget it where did your stepmother come from asked gilbert thoughtfully i don't know my father met her at some summer resort she was staying in the same boarding house she and the angelic peter she lost no time in setting her cap for my father who was doubtless reported to her as a man of property and she succeeded in capturing him i wonder at that she doesn't seem very fascinating she made herself very agreeable to my father and was even affectionate in her manner to me though i couldn't get to like her the end was that she became mrs crawford once installed in our house she soon threw off the mask and showed herself in her true colors a cold hearted selfish and disagreeable woman i wonder your father doesn't recognize her for what she is she is very artful and is politic enough to treat him well she has lost no opportunity of prejudicing him against me if he were not an invalid she would find her task more difficult did she have any property when your father married her not that i have been able to discover she is scheming to have my father leave the lion's share of his property to her and peter i dare say she will succeed let us hope your father will live till you are a young man at least and better able to cope with her i earnestly hope so your father is not an old man he is fifty one but he is not strong i believe he has liver complaint at any rate i know that when at my stepmother's instigation he applied to an insurance company to insure his life for her benefit the application was rejected you don't know anything of mrs crawford's antecedents no what was her name before she married your father she was a mrs cook that as you know is peter's name perhaps in your travels you may learn something of her history i should like to do so you won't leave us to morrow i must go to day i know now that i must depend wholly upon my own exertions and i must get to work as soon as possible you will write to me carl yes when i have anything agreeable to write let us hope that will be soon chapter vii ends in a tragedy carl obtained permission to leave his trunk at the vance mansion merely taking out what he absolutely needed for a change when i am settled i will send for it he said now i shouldn't know what to do with it there were cordial good bys and carl started once more on the tramp he might indeed have traveled by rail for he had ten dollars and thirty seven cents but it occurred to him that in walking he might meet with some one who would give him employment besides he was not in a hurry to get on nor had he any definite destination the day was fine there was a light breeze and he experienced a hopeful exhilaration as he walked lightly on with the world before him and any number of possibilities in the way of fortunate adventures that might befall him he had walked five miles when to the left he saw an elderly man hard at work in a hay field he was leaning on his rake and looking perplexed and troubled carl paused to rest and as he looked over the rail fence attracted the attention of the farmer i say young feller where are you goin he asked i don't know exactly you don't know where you are goin repeated the farmer in surprise carl laughed i am going out in the world to seek my fortune he said you be would you like a job asked the farmer eagerly what sort of a job i'd like to have you help me hayin my hired man is sick and he's left me in a hole it's goin to rain and going to rain repeated carl in surprise as he looked up at the nearly cloudless sky yes it don't look like it i know but old job hagar say it'll rain before night and what he don't know about the weather ain't worth knowin i want to get the hay on this meadow into the barn and then i'll feel safe rain or shine and you want me to help you yes you look strong and hardy yes i am pretty strong said carl complacently well what do you say all right i'll help you carl gave a spring and cleared the fence landing in the hay field having first thrown his valise over you're pretty spry said the farmer i couldn't do that no you're too heavy said carl smiling as he noted the clumsy figure of his employer now what shall i do take that rake and rake up the hay then we'll go over to the barn and get the hay wagon where is your barn the farmer pointed across the fields to a story and a half farmhouse and standing near it a good sized barn brown from want of paint and exposure to sun and rain the buildings were perhaps twenty five rods distant are you used to hayin asked the farmer well no not exactly though i've handled a rake before carl's experience however had been very limited he had to be sure had a rake in his hand but probably he had not worked more than ten minutes at it however raking is easily learned and his want of experience was not detected he started off with great enthusiasm but after a while thought it best to adopt the more leisurely movements of the farmer after two hours his hands began to blister but still he kept on i have got to make my living by hard work he said to himself and it won't do to let such a little thing as a blister interfere when he had been working a couple of hours he began to feel hungry his walk and the work he had been doing sharpened his appetite till he really felt uncomfortable it was at this time just twelve o'clock that the farmer's wife came to the front door and blew a fish horn so vigorously that it could probably have been heard half a mile the old woman's got dinner ready said the farmer if you don't mind takin your pay in victuals you can go along home with me and take a bite i think i could take two or three sir ho ho that's a good joke money's scarce and i'd rather pay in victuals if it's all the same to you do you generally find people willing to work for their board asked carl who knew that he was being imposed upon well i might pay a leetle more you work for me till sundown and i'll give you dinner and supper and fifteen cents carl wanted to laugh at this rate of compensation he felt that it would take a long time to make a fortune but he was so hungry that he would have accepted board alone if it had been necessary i agree he said shall i leave my rake here yes it'll be all right i'll take along my valise for i can't afford to run any risk of losing it jest as you say five minutes brought them to the farmhouse can i wash my hands asked carl yes you can go right to the sink and wash in the tin basin there's a roll towel behind the door mis perkins that was the way he addressed his wife this is a young chap that i've hired to help me hayin you can set a chair for him at the table all right silas he don't look very old though no ma'am i ain't twenty one yet answered carl who was really sixteen i shouldn't say you was you ain't no signs of a mustache i keep it short ma'am in warm weather said carl it don't dull a razor any to cut it in cold weather does it asked the farmer chuckling at his joke well no sir i can't say it does it was a boiled dinner that the farmer's wife provided corned beef and vegetables but the plebeian meal seemed to carl the best he ever ate afterwards there was apple pudding to which he did equal justice i never knew work improved a fellow's appetite so reflected the young traveler i never ate with so much relish at home after dinner they went back to the field and worked till the supper hour five o'clock by that time all the hay had been put into the barn we've done a good day's work said the farmer in a tone of satisfaction and only just in time do you see that dark cloud yes sir in half an hour there'll be rain or i'm mistaken old job hagar is right after all the farmer proved a true prophet in half an hour while they were at the supper table the rain began to come down in large drops forming pools in the hollows of the ground and drenching all exposed objects with the largesse of the heavens where war you a goin to night asked the farmer i don't know sir i was thinkin that i'd give you a night's lodgin in place of the fifteen cents i agreed to pay you money's very skeerce with me and will be till i've sold off some of the crops i shall be glad to make that arrangement said carl who had been considering how much the farmer would ask for lodging for there seemed small chance of continuing his journey fifteen cents was a lower price than he had calculated on that's a sensible idea said the farmer rubbing his hands with satisfaction at the thought that he had secured valuable help at no money outlay whatever the next morning carl continued his tramp refusing the offer of continued employment on the same terms he was bent on pursuing his journey though he did not know exactly where he would fetch up in the end at twelve o'clock that day he found himself in the outskirts of a town with the same uncomfortable appetite that he had felt the day before but with no hotel or restaurant anywhere near there was however a small house the outer door of which stood conveniently open through the open window carl saw a table spread as if for dinner and he thought it probable that he could arrange to become a boarder for a single meal he knocked at the door but no one came he shouted out is anybody at home and received no answer he went to a small barn just outside and peered in but no one was to be seen what should he do he was terribly hungry and the sight of the food on the table was tantalizing i'll go in as the door is open he decided and sit down to the table and eat somebody will be along before i get through and i'll pay whatever is satisfactory for eat i must he entered seated himself and ate heartily still no one appeared i don't want to go off without paying thought carl i'll see if i can find somebody he opened the door into the kitchen but it was deserted then he opened that of a small bedroom and started back in terror and dismay there suspended from a hook a man of middle age was hanging with his head bent forward his eyes wide open and his tongue protruding from his mouth chapter viii carl falls under suspicion to a person of any age such a sight as that described at the close of the last chapter might well have proved startling to a boy like carl it was simply overwhelming it so happened that he had but twice seen a dead person and never a victim of violence the peculiar circumstances increased the effect upon his mind he placed his hand upon the man's face and found that he was still warm he could have been dead but a short time what shall i do thought carl perplexed this is terrible then it flashed upon him that as he was alone with the dead man suspicion might fall upon him as being concerned in what might be called a murder i had better leave here at once he reflected i shall have to go away without paying for my meal he started to leave the house but had scarcely reached the door when two persons a man and a woman entered both looked at carl with suspicion what are you doing here asked the man i beg your pardon answered carl i was very hungry and seeing no one about took the liberty to sit down at the table and eat i am willing to pay for my dinner if you will tell me how much it amounts to wasn't my husband here asked the woman i i am afraid something has happened to your husband faltered carl what do you mean carl silently pointed to the chamber door the woman opened it and uttered a loud shriek look here walter she cried her companion quickly came to her side my husband is dead cried the woman basely murdered and there pointing fiercely to carl there stands the murderer madam you cannot believe this said carl naturally agitated what have you to say for yourself demanded the man suspiciously i only just saw your husband continued carl addressing himself to the woman i had finished my meal when i began to search for some one whom i could pay and so opened this door into the room beyond when i saw him hanging there don't believe him the red handed murderer broke out the woman fiercely he is probably a thief he killed my poor husband and then sat down like a cold blooded villain that he is and gorged himself things began to"
