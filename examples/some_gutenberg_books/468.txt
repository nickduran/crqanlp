"1" "cruel blow she was at the very time preparing to inflict as to the argument of necessity she replied that we had still abundant means of living for some weeks longer and that she would then find a resource in the kindness of some relations in the country to whom she should write she tempered her opposition by caresses so tender and impassioned that i who lived only for her and who never had the slightest misgiving as to her love applauded at once her arguments and her resolutions to manon i had committed the care of our finances and the house hold arrangements in a short time i observed that our style of living was improved and that she had treated herself to more expensive dresses as i calculated that we could hardly have at this period more than fifteen or twenty crowns remaining i did not conceal my surprise at this mysterious augmentation of our wealth she begged of me with a smile to give myself no trouble on that head did i not promise you said she that i would find resources i loved her too purely to experience the slightest suspicion one day having gone out in the afternoon and told her that i should not be at home so early as usual i was astonished on my return at being detained several minutes at the door our only servant was a young girl about our own age on her letting me in at last i asked why she had detained me so long she replied in an embarrassed tone that she did not hear me knock i only knocked once said i so if you did not hear me why come to open the door at all this query disconcerted her so visibly that losing her presence of mind she began to cry assuring me that it was not her fault and that her mistress had desired her not to open the door until m de b had had time to go down by the back staircase i was so confounded by this information as to be utterly unable to proceed to our apartment and was obliged to leave the house under the pretext of an appointment i desired the girl therefore to let her mistress know that i should return in a few minutes but on no account to say that she had spoken to me of m de b my horror was so great that i shed tears as i went along hardly knowing from what feeling they flowed i entered a coffee house close by and placing myself at a table i buried my face between my hands as though i would turn my eyes inward to ascertain what was passing in my heart still i dared not recall what i had heard the moment before i strove to look upon it as a dream and was more than once on the point of returning to my lodgings determined to attach no importance to what i had heard it appeared to me so impossible that manon could have been unfaithful that i feared even to wrong her by a suspicion i adored her that was too certain i had not on my part given her more proofs of my love than i had received of hers why then should i charge her with being less sincere and constant than myself what reason could she have to deceive me not three hours before she had lavished upon me the most tender caresses and had received mine with transport i knew her heart as thoroughly as my own no no i said it is not possible that manon can have deceived me she well knows that i live but for her that i adore her upon that point i can have no reason to be unhappy notwithstanding these reflections the visit of m de b and his secret departure gave me some uneasiness i remembered too the little purchases she had lately made which seemed beyond our present means this looked like the liberality of a new lover and the confidence with which she had foretold resources which were to me unknown i had some difficulty in solving these mysteries in as favourable a manner as my heart desired on the other hand she had been hardly out of my sight since we entered paris however occupied in our walks in all our amusements she was ever at my side heavens even a momentary separation would have been too painful i could not therefore imagine how manon could to any other person have devoted a single instant at last i thought i had discovered a clue to the mystery m de b said i to myself is a man extensively engaged in commercial affairs and manon's relations have no doubt remitted her money through his house she has probably already received some from him and he is come today to bring her more she wishes perhaps to derive amusement by and by from an agreeable surprise by keeping me at present in the dark she would doubtless have at once told me all if i had gone in as usual instead of coming here to distress myself at all events she will not conceal it from me when i broach the subject myself i cherished this idea so willingly that it considerably lightened my grief i immediately returned to my lodgings and embraced manon as tenderly as ever she received me as usual at first i was tempted to mention my conjectures which i now more than ever looked upon as certain but i restrained myself in the hope that she might render it unnecessary by informing me of all that had passed supper was served assuming an air of gaiety i took my seat at table but by the light of the candles which were between us i fancied i perceived an air of melancholy about the eyes and countenance of my beloved mistress the very thought soon damped my gaiety i remarked that her looks wore an unusual expression and although nothing could be more soft or languishing i was at a loss to discover whether they conveyed more of love than of compassion i gazed at her with equal earnestness and she perhaps had no less difficulty in comprehending from my countenance what was passing in my heart we neither spoke nor ate at length i saw tears starting from her beauteous eyes perfidious tears oh heavens i cried my dearest manon why allow your sorrows to afflict you to this degree without imparting their cause to me she answered me only with sighs which increased my misery i arose trembling from my seat i conjured her with all the urgent earnestness of love to let me know the cause of her grief i wept in endeavouring to soothe her sorrows i was more dead than alive a barbarian would have pitied my sufferings as i stood trembling with grief and apprehension while my attention was thus confined to her i heard people coming upstairs they tapped gently at the door manon gave me a kiss and escaping from my arms quickly entered the boudoir turning the key after her i imagined that not being dressed to receive strangers she was unwilling to meet the persons who had knocked i went to let them in i had hardly opened the door when i found myself seized by three men whom i recognised as my father's servants they offered not the least violence but two of them taking me by the arms the third examined my pockets and took out a small knife the only weapon i had about me they begged pardon for the necessity they were under of treating me with apparent disrespect telling me frankly that they were acting by the orders of my father and that my eldest brother was in a carriage below waiting to receive me my feelings were so overpowered that i allowed myself to be led away without making either reply or resistance i found my brother waiting for me as they had stated they placed me by his side and the coachman immediately drove by his orders towards st denis my brother embraced me most affectionately but during our ride he uttered not a word so that as i was not inclined for conversation i had as much leisure as i could desire to reflect upon my misfortunes iii that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites shakespeare the whole affair was so involved in obscurity that i could not see my way even to a reasonable conjecture i was cruelly betrayed that was certain but by whom tiberge first occurred to me tiberge said i it is as much as thy life is worth if my suspicions turn out to be well founded however i recollected that he could not by possibility know my abode and therefore he could not have furnished the information to accuse manon was more than my heart was capable of the unusual melancholy with which she had lately seemed weighed down her tears the tender kiss she gave me in parting made it all as yet a mystery to me i could only look upon her recent melancholy as a presentiment of our common misfortune and while i was deploring the event which tore me from her i was credulous enough to consider her fate as much deserving of pity as my own the result of my reflections was that i had been seen and followed in the streets of paris by some persons of my acquaintance who had conveyed the information to my father this idea comforted me i made up my mind to encounter some reproaches or perhaps harsh treatment for having outraged the paternal authority i resolved however to suffer with patience and to promise all that might be required of me in order to facilitate my speedy return to paris that i might restore life and happiness to my dear manon we soon arrived at st denis my brother surprised at my long silence thought it the effect of fear he assured me that i had nothing to apprehend from my father's severity provided i showed a disposition to return quietly to the path of duty and prove myself worthy of his affection he made me pass the night at st denis merely taking the precaution of putting the three lackeys to sleep in my room it cost me a pang to find myself in the same inn where i had stopped with manon on our way from amiens to paris the innkeeper and his servants recognised me and guessed at once the truth of my history i overheard them say ah that's the handsome young gentleman who travelled this road about a month ago with the beautiful girl he appeared so much in love with how pretty she was the poor young things how they caressed each other pity if they have been separated i pretended not to hear and kept as much out of sight as possible at st denis my brother had a chariot waiting for us in which we started early the next morning and arrived at home before night he saw my father first in order to make a favourable impression by telling him how quietly i had allowed myself to be brought away so that his reception of me was less austere than i had expected he merely rebuked me in general terms for the offence i had committed by absenting myself without his permission as for my mistress he said i richly deserved what had happened to me for abandoning myself to a person utterly unknown that he had entertained a better opinion of my discretion but that he hoped this little adventure would make me wiser i took the whole lecture only in the sense that accorded with my own notions i thanked my father for his indulgence and promised that i would in future observe a better regulated and more obedient course of conduct i felt that i had secured a triumph for from the present aspect of affairs there was no doubt that i should be free to effect my escape from the house even before the night was over we sat down to supper they rallied me about my amiens conquest and my flight with that paragon of fidelity i took their jokes in good part glad enough at being permitted to revolve in my mind the plans i had meditated but some words which fell from my father made me listen with earnest attention he spoke of perfidy and the not disinterested kindness he had received at the hands of m de b i was almost paralysed on hearing the name and begged of my father to explain himself he turned to my brother to ask if he had not told me the whole story my brother answered that i appeared to him so tranquil upon the road that he did not suppose i required this remedy to cure me of my folly i remarked that my father was doubtful whether he should give me the explanation or not i entreated him so earnestly that he satisfied me or i should rather say tortured me with the following most horrible narration he began by asking me whether i was really simple enough to believe that i had been really loved by the girl i told him confidently that i was perfectly sure of it and that nothing could make me for a moment doubt it ha ha ha said he with a loud laugh that is excellent you are a pretty dupe admirable idea twould be a thousand pities my poor chevalier to make you a knight of malta with all the requisites you possess for a patient and accommodating husband he continued in the same tone to ridicule what he was pleased to call my dullness and credulity he concluded while i maintained a profound silence by saying that according to the nicest calculation he could make of the time since my departure from amiens manon must have been in love with me about twelve days for said he i know that you left amiens on the 28th of last month this is the 29th of the present it is eleven days since m de b wrote to me i suppose he required eight days to establish a perfect understanding with your mistress so that take eight and eleven from thirty one days the time between the 28th of one month and the 29th of the next there remains twelve more or less this joke was followed by shouts of laughter i heard it all with a kind of sinking of the heart that i thought i could not bear up against until he finished you must know then continued my father since you appear as yet ignorant of it that m de b has won the affections of your idol for he can't be serious in pretending that it is his disinterested regard for me that has induced him to take her from you it would be absurd to expect such noble sentiments from a man of his description and one besides who is a perfect stranger to me he knew that you were my son and in order to get rid of you he wrote to inform me of your abode and of the life you led saying at the same time that strong measures would be necessary to secure you he offered to procure me the means of laying hold of you and it was by his direction as well as that of your mistress herself that your brother hit upon the moment for catching you unawares now you may congratulate yourself upon the duration of your triumph you know how to conquer rapid enough but you have yet to learn how to secure your conquests i could no longer endure these remarks every one of which struck a dagger to my heart i arose from the table and had not advanced four steps towards the door when i fell upon the floor perfectly senseless by prompt applications they soon brought me to myself my eyes opened only to shed a torrent of tears and my lips to utter the most sorrowful and heartrending complaints my father who always loved me most affectionately tried every means to console me i listened to him but his words were without effect i threw myself at his feet in the attitude of prayer conjuring him to let me return to paris and destroy the monster b no cried i he has not gained manon's heart he may have seduced her by charms or by drugs he may have even brutally violated her manon loves me do i not know that well he must have terrified her with a poniard to induce her to abandon me what must he not have done to have robbed me of my angelic mistress oh heaven heaven can it be possible that manon deceived me or that she has ceased to love me as i continued to rave about returning at once to paris and was perpetually starting up with that purpose my father clearly saw that while the paroxysm lasted no arguments could pacify me he conducted me to one of the upper rooms and left two servants to keep constant watch over me i was completely bewildered i would have given a thousand lives to be but for one quarter of an hour in paris i had sense enough however to know that having so openly declared my intention they would not easily allow me to quit my chamber i looked at the height of the windows seeing no possibility of escaping that way i addressed the servants in the most tranquil tone i promised with the most solemn vows to make at some future day their fortunes if they would but consent to my escape i entreated them i tried caresses and lastly threats but all were unavailing i gave myself up to despair i resolved to die and threw myself upon the bed with a firm determination to quit it only with my life in this situation i passed the night and the following day i refused the nourishment that was brought to me next morning my father came to see me in the afternoon he tried in the most affectionate manner to soothe my grief he desired me so urgently to take some refreshment that to gratify him i obeyed his wishes several days passed during which i took nothing but in his presence and at his special request he continued to furnish new arguments to restore me to my proper senses and to inspire me with merited contempt for the faithless manon i certainly had lost all esteem for her how could i esteem the most fickle and perfidious of created beings but her image those exquisite features which were engraven on my heart's core were still uneffaced i understood my own feelings i may die said i and i ought to die after so much shame and grief but i might suffer a thousand deaths without being able to forget the ingrate manon my father was surprised at my still continuing so powerfully affected he knew that i was imbued with the principles of honour and not doubting that her infidelity must make me despise her fancied that my obstinacy proceeded less from this particular passion than from a general inclination towards the sex this idea so took possession of his mind that prompted only by his affection for me he came one day to reveal his thoughts chevalier said he to me it has been hitherto my intention to make you bear the cross of malta i now see that your inclinations do not bend that way you are an admirer of beauty i shall be able to find you a wife to your taste let me candidly know how you feel upon the subject i answered that i could never again see the slightest difference amongst women and that after the misfortune i had experienced i detested them all equally i will find you one replied my father smiling who shall resemble manon in beauty but who shall be more faithful ah if you have any mercy said i you will restore my manon to me be assured my dear father that she has not betrayed me she is incapable of such base and cruel treachery it is the perfidious b who deceives both her and me if you could form an idea of her tenderness and her sincerity if you only knew her you yourself would love her you are absolutely a child replied my father how can you so delude yourself after what i have told you about her it was she who actually delivered you up to your brother you ought to obliterate even her name from your memory and take advantage if you are wise of the indulgence i am showing you i very clearly perceived that my father was right it was an involuntary emotion that made me thus take part with the traitor alas replied i after a moment's silence it is but too true that i am the unhappy victim of the vilest perfidy yes i continued while shedding tears of anger i too clearly perceive that i am indeed but a child credulity like mine was easily gulled but i shall be at no loss to revenge myself my father enquired of me my intentions i will go to paris i said set fire to b s house and immolate him and the perfidious manon together this burst made my father laugh and had only the effect of causing me to be more vigilantly watched in my cell i thus passed six long months during the first of which my mind underwent little change my feelings were in a state of perpetual alternation between hate and love between hope and despair according as the tendency of each passing thought brought manon back to my recollection at one time i could see in her the most delightful of women only and sigh for the pleasure of beholding her once more at another i felt she was the most unworthy and perfidious of mistresses and i would on these occasions swear never again to seek her but for the purpose of revenge i was supplied with books which served to restore my peace of mind i read once again all my favourite authors and i became acquainted with new ones all my former taste for study was revived you will see of what use this was to me in the sequel the light i had already derived from love enabled me to comprehend many passages in horace and virgil which had before appeared obscure i wrote an amatory commentary upon the fourth book of the aeneid i intend one day to publish it and i flatter myself it will be popular alas i used to exclaim whilst employed on that work it was for a heart like mine the faithful dido sighed and sighed in vain iv now by the strange enchantment that surrounds thee there's nothing nothing thou shalt ask in vain essex while in my confinement tiberge came one day to see me i was surprised at the affectionate joy with which he saluted me i had never hitherto observed any peculiar warmth in his friendship that could lead me to look upon it as anything more than the partiality common among boys of the same age he was so altered and had grown so manly during the five or six months since i had last seen him that his expressive features and his manner of addressing me inspired me with a feeling of respect he spoke more in the character of a mentor than a schoolfellow lamented the delusion into which i had fallen congratulated me on my reformation which he believed was now sincere and ended by exhorting me to profit by my youthful error and open my eyes to the vanity of worldly pleasures i looked at him with some astonishment which he at once perceived my dear chevalier said he to me you shall hear nothing but the strict truth of which i have assured myself by the most serious examination i had perhaps as strong an inclination for pleasure as you but heaven had at the same time in its mercy blessed me with a taste for virtue i exercised my reason in comparing the consequences of the one with those of the other and the divine aid was graciously vouchsafed to my reflections i conceived for the world a contempt which nothing can equal can you guess what it is retains me in it now he added and that prevents me from embracing a life of solitude simply the sincere friendship i bear towards you i know the excellent qualities of both your heart and head there is no good of which you may not render yourself capable the blandishments of pleasure have momentarily drawn you aside what detriment to the sacred cause of virtue your flight from amiens gave me such intense sorrow that i have not since known a moment's happiness you may judge of this by the steps it induced me to take he then told me how after discovering that i had deceived him and gone off with my mistress he procured horses for the purpose of pursuing me but having the start of him by four or five hours he found it impossible to overtake me that he arrived however at st denis half an hour after i had left it that being very sure that i must have stopped in paris he spent six weeks there in a fruitless endeavour to discover me visiting every place where he thought he should be likely to meet me and that one evening he at length recognised my mistress at the play where she was so gorgeously dressed that he of course set it down to the account of some new lover that he had followed her equipage to her house and had there learned from a servant that she was entertained in this style by m de b i did not stop here continued he i returned next day to the house to learn from her own lips what had become of you she turned abruptly away when she heard the mention of your name and i was obliged to return into the country without further information i there learned the particulars of your adventure and the extreme annoyance she had caused you but i was unwilling to visit you until i could have assurance of your being in a more tranquil state you have seen manon then cried i sighing alas you are happier than i who am doomed never again to behold her he rebuked me for this sigh which still showed my weakness for the perfidious girl he flattered me so adroitly upon the goodness of my mind and disposition that he really inspired me even on this first visit with a strong inclination to renounce as he had done the pleasures of the world and enter at once into holy orders the idea was so suited to my present frame of mind that when alone i thought of nothing else i remembered the words of the bishop of amiens who had given me the same advice and thought only of the happiness which he predicted would result from my adoption of such a course piety itself took part in these suggestions i shall lead a holy and a christian life said i i shall divide my time between study and religion which will allow me no leisure for the perilous pleasures of love i shall despise that which men ordinarily admire and as i am conscious that my heart will desire nothing but what it can esteem my cares will not be greater or more numerous than my wants and wishes i thereupon pictured to myself in anticipation a course of life peaceful and retired i fancied a retreat embosomed in a wood with a limpid stream of running water bounding my garden a library comprising the most select works a limited circle of friends virtuous and intellectual a table neatly served but frugal and temperate to all these agremens i added a literary correspondence with a friend whose residence should be in paris who should give me occasional information upon public affairs less for the gratification of my curiosity than to afford a kind of relaxation by hearing of and lamenting the busy follies of men shall not i be happy added i will not my utmost wishes be thus gratified this project flattered my inclinations extremely but after all the details of this most admirable and prudent plan i felt that my heart still yearned for something and that in order to leave nothing to desire in this most enchanting retirement one ought to be able to share it with manon however tiberge continuing to pay me frequent visits in order to strengthen me in the purpose with which he had inspired me i took an opportunity of opening the subject to my father he declared that his intention ever was to leave his children free to choose a profession and that in whatever manner i should dispose of myself all he wished to reserve was the right of aiding me with his counsel on this occasion he gave me some of the wisest which tended less to divert me from my project than to convince me of my good father's sound judgment and discretion the recommencement of the scholastic year being at hand tiberge and i agreed to"
