"1" "more boarding houses a big square white frame kept by a mrs trent the widow of a hero of two wars her hero had won her with his uniform when he returned from the mexican war his conduct was so irregular and his income so uncertain that it had been a relief to her when he departed for his second war from it he had brought home a broken constitution a maimed body and confirmed habits of shiftlessness and drunkenness his country took his character and his health and paid him in exchange a pension which just about kept him in whisky and tobacco so long as he was alive mrs trent hated him as vigorously as her christianity permitted when he was safely in his grave she canonized him she put his picture and his sword belt and epaulets in the conspicuous place in the parlor she used his record for gallantry to get herself social position and a place of honor at public gatherings her house stood back from the highway in a grove of elms and walnuts its angularity was relieved by a porch with a flat roof that had a railing about it and served as a balcony for the second story lodgers there were broad halls through the middle of the house down stairs and up olivia and pauline had the three large rooms in the second story on the south side they used the front room as a study and pauline's bedroom was next to it late one afternoon she was seated at the study window watching a cherry red sun drop through the purple haze of the autumn she became conscious that some one was on the balcony before the window of the front room across the hall she leaned so that she could see without being seen sharp against the darkening sky was the profile of a young man olivia joined her and followed her glance the profile remained fixed and the two girls watched it fascinated it certainly was a powerful outline proud and stern but with a mouth that was sweet in its kindliness and gentleness i wonder what he's thinking about said olivia in an undertone he was not fifteen feet from them i suppose some scheme for conquering the world most of battle field's youth came from the farms of that western country the young men with bodies and brains that were strong but awkward almost all were working their way through as were not a few of the women they felt that life was a large serious business impatiently waiting for them to come and attend to it in a large serious way better than it had ever been attended to before they studied hard they practised oratory and debating their talk was of history and philosophy religion and politics they slept little they thought or tried to think even more than they talked at a glance this man was one of them a fine type he's handsome isn't he said pauline but she did not finish indeed it was not clear to her what the rest of her protest was he reminded her of dumont there was the same look of superiority of the born to lead but his face seemed to have some quality which dumont's lacked or was it only the idealizing effect of the open sky and the evening light when the bell rang for supper he apparently did not hear it the two girls went down and had talked to the others a few minutes and all had seated themselves before he entered an inch or so above six feet powerful in the chest and shoulders he moved with a large grace until he became self conscious or approached the by comparison frail pieces of furniture he had penetrating candid eyes that looked dark in the gaslight but were steel blue his face now wore the typical western american expression shrewd easy going good humor mrs trent intrenched in state behind a huge silver plated coffee urn with ivory trimmed faucet introduced him mr scarborough to olivia to pauline to sadie mcintosh to pierson and howe and thiebaud pronounced cay bo scarborough sat directly opposite olivia but whenever he lifted his eyes from his plate he looked at pauline who was next to her when she caught him he blushed and stirred in his chair so uneasily that it creaked and crackled and his normal difficulties with his large hands and the small knife and fork were distressingly increased pauline was disappointed in him his clothes were ill fitting and gave him the appearance of being in danger of bursting from them his hair was too long suggesting a shaggy tawny mane though his hands were well shaped they had the recent scars of hard manual labor thus when olivia spoke enthusiastically of him after supper she made no reply she would have been ashamed to acknowledge the reasons for her lack of admiration even had she been conscious of them but the next morning at breakfast she revised her opinion somewhat he talked and he had a remarkable voice clear musical with a quality which made it seem to penetrate through all the nerves instead of through the auditory nerve only further he talked straight to pauline without embarrassment and with a quaint satiric humor she was forgetting for the moment his almost uncouth hair and dress when in making a sweeping gesture he upset a glass of water and sent a plate of hot bread flying from the waitress hand he'd do well in the open air thought she but he's out of place in a house still she found him interesting and original and he persistently sought her his persistence was little short of heroism in view of the never wholly concealed sufferings which the contrast between her grace and style and his lack of both caused him he looks like a king who had been kidnapped as a child and brought up in the wilds said olivia i wonder who he is i'll ask him replied pauline and olivia was slyly amused by her cousin's unconscious pride in her power with this large untamed person iii and scarborough his name was hampden scarborough and he came from a farm about twenty miles east of saint x he was descended from men who had learned to hate kings in holland in the sixteenth century had learned to despise them in england in the seventeenth century had learned to laugh at them in america in the eighteenth century had learned to exalt themselves into kings the kings of the new democracy in the free west in the nineteenth century when any one asked his father bladen scarborough who the family ancestors were bladen usually did not answer at all it was his habit thus to treat a question he did not fancy and if the question was repeated to supplement silence with a piercing look from under his aggressive eyebrows but sometimes he would answer it once for example he looked coldly at the man who with a covert sneer had asked it said you're impudent sir you insinuate i'm not enough by myself to command your consideration and struck him a staggering blow across the mouth again he was in a playful mood that day and the questioner was a woman he replied i'm descended from murderers ma'am murderers and in a sense it was the truth in 1568 the scarboroughs were seated obscurely in an east county of england they were tenant farmers on the estates of the earl of ashford and had been strongly infected with leveling ideas by the refugees then fleeing to england to escape the fury of continental prince and priest john scarborough was trudging along the highway with his sister kate on horseback came aubrey walton youngest son of the earl of ashford he admired the rosy pretty face of kate scarborough he dismounted and without so much as a glance at her brother put his arm round her john snatched her free young walton all amazement and wrath at the hind who did not appreciate the favor he was condescending to bestow upon a humble maiden ripped out an insult and drew his sword john wrenched it from him and ran it through his body that night with four gold pieces in his pocket john scarborough left england in a smuggler and was presently fighting philip of spain in the army of the dutch people in 1653 zachariah scarborough great grandson of the preceding was a soldier in cromwell's army on the night of april twentieth he was in an ale house off fleet street with three brother officers that day cromwell had driven out parliament and had dissolved the council of state three of the officers were of cromwell's party the fourth captain zachariah scarborough was a leveler a hater of kings a dutch bred pioneer of dutch bred democracy the discussion began hot and they poured ale on it he's a tyrant shouted zachariah scarborough bringing his huge fist down on the table and upsetting a mug he has set up for king down with all kings say i his head must come off at this knives were drawn and when zachariah scarborough staggered into the darkness of filthy fleet street with a cut down his cheek from temple to jaw bone his knife was dripping the life of a cousin of ireton's he fled to the virginia plantations and drifted thence to north carolina his great grandson gaston scarborough was one of marion's men in his boyhood a fierce spirit made arrogant by isolated freedom where every man of character owned his land and could conceive of no superior between him and almighty god one autumn day in 1794 gaston was out shooting with his youngest brother john their father's favorite gaston's gun was caught by a creeper was torn from him and his hand reaching for it exploded the charge into his brother's neck his brother fell backward into the swamp and disappeared gaston plunged into the wilderness to tennessee to kentucky to indiana and it's my turn said hampden scarborough as he ended a brief recital of the ancestral murders which pauline had drawn from him they were out for a walk together your turn she inquired yes i'm the great grandson the only one it's always a great grandson you do look dangerous said pauline and the smile and the glance she sent with the words might have been misunderstood by a young man entertaining the ideas which were then filling that young man's brain again he told her how he had been sent to college she was always leading him to talk of himself and her imagination more than supplied that which his unaffected modesty sometimes deliberately more often unconsciously kept out of his stories ever since he could remember his strongest passion had been for books for reading before he was born the wilderness was subdued and the cruel toil of his parents early life was mitigated by the growth of towns the spread of civilization there was a chance for some leisure for the higher gratification of the intense american passion for education a small library had sprung up in one corner of the general room of the old farm house from the seeds of a bible an almanac milton's paradise lost baxter's saint's rest and a government report on cattle but the art collection had stood still for years a facsimile of the declaration of independence another of the emancipation proclamation pictures of washington lincoln and napoleon the last held in that household second only to washington in all history as a leveler the only daughter arabella had been sent to boarding school in cincinnati she married a rich man lived in the city and under the inspiration of english novels and the tutelage of a woman friend who visited in new york and often went abroad was developing ideas of family and class and rank she talked feelingly of the lower classes and of the duty of the upper class toward them her goings on created an acid prejudice against higher education in her father's mind as she was unfolding to him a plan for sending hampden to harvard he interrupted with no more idiots in my family at my expense and started out to feed the pigs the best terms hampden's mother could make were that he should not be disinherited and cast off if he went to battle field and paid his own way he did not tell pauline all of this nor did he repeat to her the conversation between himself and his father a few days before he left home is bella going to pay your way through asked his father looking at him severely but he looked severely at every one except hampden's gentle voiced mother no sir the son's voice was clear is your mother no sir have you got money put by four hundred dollars is that enough it'll give me time for a long look around the old man drew a big rusty pocketbook from the inside pocket of the old fashioned flowered velvet waistcoat he wore even when he fed the pigs he counted out upon his knee ten one hundred dollar bills he held them toward his son that'll have to do you he said that's all you'll get no thank you replied hampden i wish no favors from anybody you've earned it over and above your keep retorted his father it belongs to you if i need it i'll send for it said hampden that being the easiest way quickly to end the matter but he did tell pauline that he purposed to pay his own way through college my father has a notion said he that the things one works for and earns are the only things worth having and i think one can't begin to act on that notion too early if one is trying to get an education why not an all round education instead of only lessons out of books from that moment pauline ceased to regard dress or any other external feature as a factor in her estimate of hampden scarborough but your plan might make a man too late in getting a start some men at least she suggested a start for what he asked for fame or fortune or success of any kind scarborough's eyes fixed on the distance had a curious look in them he was again exactly like that first view she had had of him but suppose one isn't after any of those things he said suppose he thinks of life as simply an opportunity for self development he starts at it when he's born and the more of it he does the more he has to do and he can't possibly fail and every moment is a triumph and he came back from his excursion and smiled apologetically at her but she was evidently interested don't you think a man ought to have ambition she asked she was thinking of her lover and his audacious schemes for making himself powerful oh a man is what he is ambition means so many different things but shouldn't you like to be rich and famous and all that it depends scarborough felt that if he said what was in his mind it might sound like cant so he changed the subject just now my ambition is to get off that zoology condition iv a dumont triumph but in the first week of her second month pauline's interest in her surroundings vanished she was corresponding with jennie atwater and jennie began to write of dumont he had returned to saint x caroline sylvester of cleveland was visiting his mother it was all but certain that jack and caroline would marry her people want it jennie went on she pretended to believe that jack and pauline had given each the other up and jack's father is determined on it they're together morning noon and evening she's really very swell though _i_ don't think she's such a raving beauty following this came the saint x news bulletin with a broad hint that the engagement was about to be announced it's ridiculously false said pauline to herself but she tossed for hours each night trying to soothe the sick pain in her heart and while she scouted the possibility of losing him she was for the first time entertaining it a cloud in the great horizon of her faith in the future a small cloud but black and bold against the blue and she had no suspicion that he had returned from chicago deliberately to raise that cloud a few days later another letter from jennie full of gossip about jack and caroline a news bulletin with a long article about caroline ending with an even broader hint of her approaching marriage and dumont sent pauline a note from the hotel in villeneuve five miles from battle field i must see you do not deny me it means everything to both of us what i want to say to you and he asked her to meet him in the little park in battle field on the bank of the river where no one but the factory hands and their families ever went and they only in the evenings the hour he fixed was ten the next morning and she cut ancient history and was there as he advanced to meet her she thought she had never before appreciated how handsome he was how distinguished looking perfectly her ideal of what a man should be especially in that important and at battle field neglected matter dress she was without practice in indirection but she successfully hid her jealousy and her fears though his manner was making their taunts and threats desperately real he seemed depressed and gloomy he would not look at her he shook hands with her almost coldly though they had not seen each other for weeks had not talked together for months she felt faint and her thoughts were like flocks of circling croaking crows polly he began when they were in the secluded corner of the park father wants me to get married he's in a rage at your father for treating me so harshly he wants me to marry a girl who's visiting us he's always at me about it making all sorts of promises and threats her father's in the same business that we are and he glanced at her to note the effect of his words she had drawn her tall figure to its full height and her cheeks were flushed and her eyes curiously bright he had stabbed straight and deep into the heart of her weakness but also into the heart of her pride the only effect of his thrust that was visible to him put him in a panic don't please don't look that way polly he went on hastily you don't see what i'm driving at yet i didn't mean that i'd marry her or think of it there isn't anybody but you there couldn't be you know that why did you tell me then she asked haughtily because i had to begin somewhere polly i'm going away going abroad and i'm not to see you for for i don't know how long and we must be married she looked at him in a daze we can cross on the ferry at half past ten he went on you see that house the white one he pointed to the other bank of the river where a white cottage shrank among the trees not far from a little church mr barker lives there you must have heard of him he's married scores and hundreds of couples from this side and we can be back here at half past eleven twelve at the latest she shook her head expressed not determination only doubt i can't jack she said they then you aren't certain you're ever going to marry me he interrupted bitterly you don't mean what you promised me you care more for them than you do for me you don't really care for me at all you don't believe that she protested her eyes and her mind on the little white cottage you couldn't you know me too well then there's no reason why we shouldn't get married don't we belong to each other now why should we refuse to stand up and say so that seemed unanswerable a perfect excuse for doing what she wished to do for the little white cottage fascinated her how she did long to be sure of him and she felt so free so absolutely her own mistress in these new surroundings where no one attempted to exercise authority over another i must feel sure of you pauline sometimes everything seems to be against me and i even doubt you and that's when the temptations pull hardest if we were married it'd all be different yes it would be different and he would be securely hers with her mind at rest instead of harassed as it would be if she let him go so far away free and where was the harm in merely repeating before a preacher the promise that now bound them both she looked at him and he at her you don't put any others before me do you dear he asked no jack no one i belong to you come he pleaded and they went down to the boat she seemed to herself to be in a dream in a trance as she walked beside him along the country road on the other shore a voice was ringing in her ears don't don't ask olivia's advice first but she walked on her will suspended substituted for it his will and her jealousy and her fears of his yielding to the urgings of his father and the blandishments of that cleveland girl he said little but kept close to her watching her narrowly touching her tenderly now and then the reverend josiah barker was waiting for them an oily smirk on a face smooth save where a thin fringe of white whiskers dangled from his jaw bone ear to ear fat damp hands rubbing in anticipation of the large fee that was to repay him for celebrating the marriage and for keeping quiet about it afterward at the proper place in the brief ceremony dumont with a sly smile at pauline which she faintly returned produced the ring he had bought it at saint x a week before and so had started a rumor that he and caroline sylvester were to be married in haste he held pauline's hand firmly as he put the ring on her finger he was significantly cool and calm for his age and for the circumstances she was trembling violently was pale and wan the ring burned into her flesh whom god hath joined together let no man put asunder ended barker with pompous solemnity dumont kissed her her cheek was cold and at the touch of his lips she shuddered don't be afraid he said in a low voice that was perfectly steady they went out and along the sunny road in silence whom god hath joined the voice was now dinning into her ears and she was saying to herself has god joined us if so why do i feel as if i had committed a crime she looked guiltily at him she felt no thrill of pride or love at the thought that he was her husband she his wife and into her mind poured all her father's condemnations of him with a vague menacing fear riding the crest of the flood you're sorry you've done it he said sullenly she did not answer well it's done he went on and it can't be undone and i've got you polly in spite of them they might have known better than to try to keep me from getting what i wanted i always did and i always shall she looked at him startled then hastily looked away even more than his words and his tone she disliked his eyes gloating triumphant but not until she was years more experienced did she study that never forgotten expression study it as a whole words tone look then and not until then did she know that she had instinctively shrunk because he had laid bare his base and all but loveless motive in marrying her and he added i'll force father to give me a big interest in the business very soon then we'll announce it announce it announce what why i'm a married woman she thought and she stumbled and almost fell the way danced before her eyes all spotted with black she was just able to walk aboard the boat and drop into a seat he sat beside her took her hand and bent over it as he kissed it a tear fell on it he looked at her and she saw that his eyes were swimming a sob surged into her throat but she choked it back jack she murmured and hid her face in her handkerchief when they looked each at the other both smiled her foreboding had retreated to the background she began to turn the ring round and round upon her finger mrs john dumont she said doesn't it sound queer and she gazed dreamily away toward the ranges of hills between which the river danced and sparkled as it journeyed westward when she again became conscious of her immediate surroundings other than dumont she saw a deck hand looking at her with a friendly grin instantly she covered the ring with her hand and handkerchief but i mustn't wear it she said to dumont no not on your finger he laughed and drew from his pocket a slender gold chain but you might wear it on this round your neck it'll help to remind you that you don't belong to yourself any more but to me she took the chain she was coloring in a most becoming way and hid it and the ring in her bosom then she drew off a narrow hoop of gold with a small setting and pushed it on his big little finger and that sir she said with a bewitching look may help you not to forget that you belong to me she left the ferry in advance of him and faced olivia just in time for them to go down together to the half past twelve o'clock dinner v four friends as mrs trent's was the best board in battle field there were more applicants than she could make places for at her one table in the second week of the term she put a small table in the alcove of the dining room and gave it to her star boarders pierson olivia and pauline they invited scarborough to take the fourth place not only did pierson sit opposite olivia and scarborough opposite pauline three times a day in circumstances which make for intimacy but also olivia and pierson studied together in his sitting room and pauline and scarborough in her sitting room for several hours three or four times a week olivia and pierson were sophomores pauline and scarborough were freshmen also they happened to have the same three senior prep conditions to work off latin zoology and mathematics such intimacies as these were the matter of course at battle field they were usually brief and strenuous a young man and a young woman would be seen together constantly would fall in love would come to know each the other thoroughly then with the mind and character and looks and moods of each fully revealed to the other they would drift or fly in opposite directions wholly disillusioned occasionally they found that they were really congenial and either love remained or a cordial friendship sprang up the modes of thought inconceivable to europeans or europeanized americans made catastrophe all but impossible it was through the girls that scarborough got his invitation to the alcove table there he came to know pierson and to like him one evening he went into pierson's rooms the suite under olivia and pauline's he had never seen but had dreamed of such a luxurious bachelor interior pierson's father had insisted that his son must go to the college where forty years before he had split wood and lighted fires and swept corridors to earn two years of higher education pierson's mother defeated in her wish that her son should go east to college had tried to mitigate the rigors of battle field's primitive simplicity by herself fitting up his quarters and she made them the show rooms of the college now let's see what can be done for you said pierson with the superiority of a whole year's experience where scarborough was a beginner i'll put you in the sigma alpha fraternity for one thing it's the best here i don't know anything about fraternities scarborough said what are they for oh everybody that is anybody belongs to a fraternity there are about a dozen of them here and among them they get all the men with any claim to recognition just now we lean rather toward taking in the fellows who've been well brought up does everybody belong to a fraternity lord no two thirds don't belong the fellows outside are called barbs that is barbarians we on the inside are greeks though i must say very few of us are athenians and most of us are the rankest macedonians but the worst greeks are better than the best barbs they're the rummest lot of scrubs you ever saw stupid drudges who live round in all sorts of holes and don't amount to anything"
