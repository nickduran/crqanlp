"1" "that he took keen pride in striving to outdo the men who worked with him and this spirit despite the suspicion which the captain entertained of billy since the episode of the forecastle went far to making his life more endurable on board the halfmoon for workers such as the mucker developed into are not to be sneezed at and though he had little idea of subordination it was worth putting up with something to keep him in condition to work it was this line of reasoning that saved billy's skull on one or two occasions when his impudence had been sufficient to have provoked the skipper to a personal assault upon him under ordinary conditions and mr ward having tasted of billy's medicine once had no craving for another encounter with him that would entail personal conflict the entire crew was made up of ruffians and unhung murderers but skipper simms had had little experience with seamen of any other ilk so he handled them roughshod using his horny fist and the short heavy stick that he habitually carried in lieu of argument but with the exception of billy the men all had served before the mast in the past so that ship's discipline was to some extent ingrained in them all enjoying his work the life was not an unpleasant one for the mucker the men of the forecastle were of the kind he had always known there was no honor among them no virtue no kindliness no decency with them billy was at home he scarcely missed the old gang he made his friends among them and his enemies he picked quarrels as had been his way since childhood his science and his great strength together with his endless stock of underhand tricks brought him out of each encounter with fresh laurels presently he found it difficult to pick a fight his messmates had had enough of him they left him severely alone these ofttimes bloody battles engendered no deep seated hatred in the hearts of the defeated they were part of the day's work and play of the half brutes that skipper simms had gathered together there was only one man aboard whom billy really hated that was the passenger and billy hated him not because of anything that the man had said or done to billy for he had never even so much as spoken to the mucker but because of the fine clothes and superior air which marked him plainly to billy as one of that loathed element of society a gentleman billy hated everything that was respectable he had hated the smug self satisfied merchants of grand avenue he had writhed in torture at the sight of every shiny purring automobile that had ever passed him with its load of well groomed men and women a clean stiff collar was to billy as a red rag to a bull cleanliness success opulence decency spelled but one thing to billy physical weakness and he hated physical weakness his idea of indicating strength and manliness lay in displaying as much of brutality and uncouthness as possible to assist a woman over a mud hole would have seemed to billy an acknowledgement of pusillanimity to stick out his foot and trip her so that she sprawled full length in it the hall mark of bluff manliness and so he hated with all the strength of a strong nature the immaculate courteous well bred man who paced the deck each day smoking a fragrant cigar after his meals inwardly he wondered what the dude was doing on board such a vessel as the halfmoon and marveled that so weak a thing dared venture among real men billy's contempt caused him to notice the passenger more than he would have been ready to admit he saw that the man's face was handsome but there was an unpleasant shiftiness to his brown eyes and then entirely outside of his former reasons for hating him billy came to loathe him intuitively as one who was not to be trusted finally his dislike for the man became an obsession he haunted when discipline permitted that part of the vessel where he would be most likely to encounter the object of his wrath hoping always hoping that the dude would give him some slight pretext for pushing in his mush as billy would so picturesquely have worded it he was loitering about the deck for this purpose one evening when he overheard part of a low voiced conversation between the object of his wrath and skipper simms just enough to set him to wondering what was doing and to show him that whatever it might be it was crooked and that the immaculate passenger and skipper simms were both in on it he questioned bony sawyer and red sanders but neither had nearly as much information as billy himself and so the halfmoon came to honolulu and lay at anchor some hundred yards from a stanch trim white yacht and none knew other than the halfmoon's officers and her single passenger the real mission of the harmless looking little brigantine chapter iii the conspiracy no shore leave was granted the crew of the halfmoon while the vessel lay off honolulu and deep and ominous were the grumblings of the men only first officer ward and the second mate went ashore skipper simms kept the men busy painting and holystoning as a vent for their pent emotions billy byrne noticed that the passenger had abandoned his daylight strolls on deck in fact he never once left his cabin while the halfmoon lay at anchor until darkness had fallen then he would come on deck often standing for an hour at a time with eyes fastened steadily upon the brave little yacht from the canopied upper deck of which gay laughter and soft music came floating across the still water when mr ward and the second mate came to shore a strange thing happened they entered a third rate hotel near the water front engaged a room for a week paid in advance were in their room for half an hour and emerged clothed in civilian raiment then they hastened to another hostelry a first class one this time and the second mate walked ahead in frock coat and silk hat while mr ward trailed behind in a neat blue serge sack suit carrying both bags at the second hotel the second mate registered as henri theriere count de cadenet and servant france his first act thereafter was to hand a note to the clerk asking that it be dispatched immediately the note was addressed to anthony harding esq on board yacht lotus count de cadenet and his servant repaired immediately to the count's rooms there to await an answer to the note henri theriere the second officer of the halfmoon in frock coat and silk hat looked every inch a nobleman and a gentleman what his past had been only he knew but his polished manners his knowledge of navigation and seamanship and his leaning toward the ways of the martinet in his dealings with the men beneath him had led skipper simms to assume that he had once held a commission in the french navy from which he doubtless had been kicked in disgrace the man was cold cruel of a moody disposition and quick to anger he had been signed as second officer for this cruise through the intervention of divine and clinker he had sailed with simms before but the skipper had found him too hard a customer to deal with and had been on the point of seeking another second when divine and clinker discovered him on board the halfmoon and after ten minutes conversation with him found that he fitted so perfectly into their scheme of action that they would not hear of simms releasing him ward had little use for the frenchman whose haughty manner and condescending airs grated on the sensibilities of the uncouth and boorish first officer the duty which necessitated him acting in the capacity of theriere's servant was about as distasteful to him as anything could be and only served to add to his hatred for the inferior who in the bottom of his heart he knew to be in every way except upon the roster of the halfmoon his superior but money can work wonders and divine's promise that the officers and crew of the halfmoon would have a cool million united states dollars to divide among them in case of the success of the venture had quite effectually overcome any dislike which mr ward had felt for this particular phase of his duty the two officers sat in silence in their room at the hotel awaiting an answer to the note they had dispatched to anthony harding esq the parts they were to act had been carefully rehearsed on board the halfmoon many times each was occupied with his own thoughts and as they had nothing in common outside the present rascality that had brought them together and as that subject was one not well to discuss more than necessary there seemed no call for conversation on board the yacht in the harbor preparations were being made to land a small party that contemplated a motor trip up the nuuanu valley when a small boat drew alongside and a messenger from the hotel handed a sealed note to one of the sailors from the deck of the halfmoon skipper simms witnessed the transaction smiling inwardly billy byrne also saw it but it meant nothing to him he had been lolling upon the deck of the brigantine glaring at the yacht lotus hating her and the gay well dressed men and women he could see laughing and chatting upon her deck they represented to him the concentrated essence of all that was pusillanimous disgusting loathsome in that other world that was as far separated from him as though he had been a grubworm in the manure pile back of brady's livery stable he saw the note handed by the sailor to a gray haired smooth faced man a large sleek well groomed man billy could imagine the white hands and polished nails of him the thought was nauseating the man who took and opened the note was anthony harding esq he read it and then passed it to a young woman who stood near by talking with other young people here barbara he said is something of more interest to you than to me if you wish i'll call upon him and invite him to dinner tonight the girl was reading the note anthony harding esq on board yacht lotus honolulu my dear mr harding this will introduce a very dear friend of mine count de cadenet who expects to be in honolulu about the time that you are there the count is traveling for pleasure and as he is entirely unacquainted upon the islands any courtesies which you may show him will be greatly appreciated cordially l cortwrite divine the girl smiled as she finished perusing the note larry is always picking up titles and making dear friends of them she laughed i wonder where he found this one or where this one found him suggested mr harding well i suppose that the least we can do is to have him aboard for dinner we'll be leaving tomorrow so there won't be much entertaining we can do let's pick him up on our way through town now suggested barbara harding and take him with us for the day that will be settling our debt to friendship and dinner tonight can depend upon what sort of person we find the count to be as you will replied her father and so it came about that two big touring cars drew up before the count de cadenet's hotel half an hour later and anthony harding esq entered and sent up his card the count came down in person to greet his caller harding saw at a glance that the man was a gentleman and when he had introduced him to the other members of the party it was evident that they appraised him quite as had their host barbara harding seemed particularly taken with the count de cadenet insisting that he join those who occupied her car and so it was that the second officer of the halfmoon rode out of honolulu in pleasant conversation with the object of his visit to the island barbara harding found de cadenet an interesting man there was no corner of the globe however remote with which he was not to some degree familiar he was well read and possessed the ability to discuss what he had read intelligently and entertainingly there was no evidence of moodiness in him now he was the personification of affability for was he not monopolizing the society of a very beautiful and very wealthy young lady the day's outing had two significant results it put into the head of the second mate of the halfmoon that which would have caused his skipper and the retiring mr divine acute mental perturbation could they have guessed it and it put de cadenet into possession of information which necessitated his refusing the urgent invitation to dine upon the yacht lotus that evening the information that the party would sail the following morning en route to manila i cannot tell you he said to mr harding how much i regret the circumstance that must rob me of the pleasure of accepting your invitation only absolute necessity i assure you could prevent me being with you as long as possible and though he spoke to the girl's father he looked directly into the eyes of barbara harding a young woman of less experience might have given some outward indication of the effect of this speech upon her but whether she was pleased or otherwise the count de cadenet could not guess for she merely voiced the smiling regrets that courtesy demanded they left de cadenet at his hotel and as he bid them farewell the man turned to barbara harding with a low aside i shall see you again miss harding he said very very soon she could not guess what was in his mind as he voiced this rather under the circumstances unusual statement could she have the girl would have been terror stricken but she saw that in his eyes which she could translate and she wondered many times that evening whether she were pleased or angry with the message it conveyed the moment de cadenet entered the hotel he hurried to the room where the impatient mr ward awaited him quick he cried we must bundle out of here posthaste they sail tomorrow morning your duties as valet have been light and short lived but i can give you an excellent recommendation should you desire to take service with another gentleman that'll be about all of that mr theriere snapped the first officer coldly i did not embark upon this theatrical enterprise for amusement i see nothing funny in it and i wish you to remember that i am still your superior officer theriere shrugged ward did not chance to catch the ugly look in his companion's eye together they gathered up their belongings descended to the office paid their bill and a few moments later were changing back to their sea clothes in the little hotel where they first had engaged accommodations half an hour later they stepped to the deck of the halfmoon billy byrne saw them from where he worked in the vicinity of the cabin when they were not looking he scowled maliciously at them they were the personal representatives of authority and billy hated authority in whatever guise it might be visited upon him he hated law and order and discipline i'd like to meet one of dem guys on green street some night he thought he saw them enter the captain's cabin with the skipper and then he saw mr divine join them billy noted the haste displayed by the four and it set him to wondering the scrap of conversation between divine and simms that he had overheard returned to him he wanted to hear more and as billy was not handicapped by any overly refined notions of the ethics which frown upon eavesdropping he lost no time in transferring the scene of his labors to a point sufficiently close to one of the cabin ports to permit him to note what took place within what the mucker beard of that conversation made him prick up his ears he saw that something after his own heart was doing something crooked and he wondered that so pusillanimous a thing as divine could have a hand in it it almost changed his estimate of the passenger of the halfmoon the meeting broke up so suddenly that billy had to drop to his knees to escape the observation of those within the cabin as it was theriere who had started to leave a second before the others caught a fleeting glimpse of a face that quickly had been withdrawn from the cabin skylight as though its owner were fearful of detection without a word to his companions the frenchman left the cabin but once outside he bounded up the companionway to the deck with the speed of a squirrel nor was he an instant too soon for as he emerged from below he saw the figure of a man disappearing forward hey there you he cried come back here the mucker turned a sulky scowl upon his lowering countenance and the second officer saw that it was the fellow who had given ward such a trimming the first day out oh it's you is it byrne he said in a not unpleasant tone come to my quarters a moment i want to speak with you and so saying he wheeled about and retraced his way below the seaman at his heels my man said theriere once the two were behind the closed door of the officer's cabin i needn't ask how much you overheard of the conversation in the captain's cabin if you hadn't overheard a great deal more than you should you wouldn't have been so keen to escape detection just now what i wanted to say to you is this keep a close tongue in your head and stick by me in what's going to happen in the next few days this bunch he jerked his thumb in the direction of the captain's cabin are fixing their necks for halters an i for one don't intend to poke my head through any noose of another man's making there's more in this thing if it's handled right and handled without too many men in on the whack up than we can get out of it if that man divine has to be counted in i've a plan of my own an it won't take but three or four of us to put it across you don't like ward he continued and you may be almighty sure that mr ward ain't losing any sleep nights over love of you if you stick to that bunch ward will do you out of your share as sure as you are a foot high an the chances are that he'll do you out of a whole lot more besides as a matter of fact byrne you're a mighty poor life insurance risk right now with a life expectancy that's pretty near minus as long as bender ward is on the same ship with you do you understand what i mean aw said billy byrne i ain't afraid o that stiff let him make any funny crack at me an i'll cave in a handful of slats for him the piker that's all right too byrne said theriere of course you can do it if anybody can provided you get the chance but ward isn't the man to give you any chance there may be shooting necessary within the next day or so and there's nothing to prevent ward letting you have it in the back purely by accident and if he don't do it then there'll be all kinds of opportunities for it before any of us ever see a white man's port again he'll get you byrne he's that kind now with my proposition you'll be shut of ward skipper simms and divine there'll be more money in it for you an you won't have to go around expecting a bullet in the small of your back every minute what do you say are you game or shall i have to go back to skipper simms and ward and tell them that i caught you eavesdropping oh i'm game said billy byrne if you'll promise me a square deal on the divvy the frenchman extended his hand let's shake on it he said billy took the proffered palm in his that's a go he said but hadn't you better wise me to wot's doin not now said theriere someone might overhear just as you did wait a bit until i have a better opportunity and i'll tell you all there is to know in the meantime think over who'd be the best men to let into this with us we'll need three or four more besides ourselves now go on deck about your duties as though nothing had happened and if i'm a bit rougher than usual with you you'll understand that it's to avert any possible suspicion later i'm next said billy byrne chapter iv piracy by dusk the trim little brigantine was scudding away toward the west before a wind that could not have suited her better had it been made to order at the special behest of the devil himself to speed his minions upon their devil's work all hands were in the best of humor the crew had forgotten their recent rancor at not having been permitted shore leave at honolulu in the expectancy of adventure in the near future for there was that in the atmosphere of the halfmoon which proclaimed louder than words the proximity of excitement and the goal toward which they had been sailing since they left san francisco skipper simms and divine were elated at the luck which had brought them to honolulu in the nick of time and at the success of theriere's mission at that port they had figured upon a week at least there before the second officer of the halfmoon could ingratiate himself sufficiently into the goodwill of the hardings to learn their plans and now they were congratulating themselves upon their acumen in selecting so fit an agent as the frenchman for the work he had handled so expeditiously and so well ward was pleased that he had not been forced to prolong the galling masquerade of valet to his inferior officer he was hopeful too that coming events would bring to the fore an opportunity to satisfy the vengeance he had inwardly sworn against the sailor who had so roughly manhandled him a few weeks past theriere had not been in error in his estimate of his fellow officer billy byrne the arduous labor of making sail over for the time was devoting his energies to the task of piecing out from what theriere had told him and what he had overheard outside the skipper's cabin some sort of explanation of the work ahead as he pondered theriere's proposition he saw the wisdom of it it would give those interested a larger amount of the booty for their share another feature of it was that it was underhanded and that appealed strongly to the mucker now if he could but devise some scheme for double crossing theriere the pleasure and profit of the adventure would be tripled it was this proposition that was occupying his attention when he caught sight of bony sawyer and red sanders emerging from the forecastle billy byrne hailed them when the mucker had explained the possibilities of profit that were to be had by entering the conspiracy aimed at simms and ward the two seamen were enthusiastically for it bony sawyer suggested that the black cook blanco was about the only other member of the crew upon whom they could depend and at byrne's request bony promised to enlist the cooperation of the giant ethiopian from early morning of the second day out of honolulu keen eyes scanned the eastern horizon through powerful glasses until about two bells of the afternoon watch a slight smudge became visible about two points north of east immediately the course of the halfmoon was altered so that she bore almost directly north by west in an effort to come safely into the course of the steamer which was seen rising rapidly above the horizon the new course of the brigantine was held as long as it seemed reasonably safe without danger of being sighted under full sail by the oncoming vessel then her head was brought into the wind and one by one her sails were lowered and furled as the keen eyes of second officer theriere announced that there was no question but that the white hull in the distance was that of the steam pleasure yacht lotus upon the deck of the unsuspecting vessel a merry party laughed and chatted in happy ignorance of the plotters in their path it was nearly half an hour after the halfmoon had come to rest drifting idly under bare poles that the lookout upon the lotus sighted her sailin vessel lyin to west half south he shouted flyin distress signals in an instant guests and crew had hurried to points of vantage where they might obtain unobstructed view of the stranger and take advantage of this break in the monotony of a long sea voyage anthony harding was on the bridge with the captain and both men had leveled their glasses upon the distant ship can you make her out asked the owner she's a brigantine replied the officer and all that i can make out from here would indicate that everything was shipshape about her her canvas is neatly furled and she is evidently well manned for i can see a number of figures above deck apparently engaged in watching us i'll alter our course and speak to her we'll see what's wrong and give her a hand if we can that's right replied harding do anything you can for them a moment later he joined his daughter and their guests to report the meager information he had how exciting exclaimed barbara harding of course it's not a real shipwreck but maybe it's the next thing to it the poor souls may have been drifting about here in the center of the pacific without food or water for goodness knows how many weeks and now just think how they must be lifting their voices in thanks to god for his infinite mercy in guiding us to them if they've been drifting for any considerable number of weeks without food or water hazarded billy mallory about the only things they'll need'll be what we didn't have the foresight to bring along an undertaker and a preacher don't be horrid billy returned miss harding you know perfectly well that i didn't mean weeks i meant days and anyway they'll be grateful to us for what we can do for them i can scarcely wait to hear their story billy mallory was inspecting the stranger through mr harding's glass suddenly he gave an exclamation of dismay by george he cried it is serious after all that ship's afire look mr harding and he passed the glass over to his host and sure enough as the owner of the lotus found the brigantine again in the center of his lens he saw a thin column of black smoke rising amidships but what he did not see was mr ward upon the opposite side of the halfmoon's cabin superintending the burning by the black cook of a bundle of oily rags in an iron boiler by jove exclaimed mr harding this is terrible the poor devils are panic stricken look at em making for the boats and with that he dashed back to the bridge to confer with his captain yes said that officer i noticed the smoke about the same time you did funny it wasn't apparent before i've already signaled full speed ahead and i've instructed mr foster to have the boats in readiness to lower away if we find that they're short of boats on the brigantine what i can't understand he added after a moment's silence is why they didn't show any signs of excitement about that fire until we came within easy sight of them it looks funny well we'll know in a few minutes more returned mr harding the chances are that the fire is just a recent addition to their predicament whatever it may be and that they have only just discovered it themselves then it can't have gained enough headway insisted the captain to cause them any such immediate terror as would be indicated by the haste with which the whole ship's crew is tumbling into those boats but as you say sir we'll have their story out of them in a few minutes now so it's idle speculating beforehand the officers and men of the halfmoon in so far as those on board the lotus could guess had all entered the boats at last and were pulling frantically away from their own ship toward the rapidly nearing yacht but what they did not guess and could not know was that mr divine paced nervously to and fro in his cabin while second officer theriere tended the smoking rags that ward and blanco had resigned to him that they might take their places"
