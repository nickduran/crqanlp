as elsa was arranging the veil upon her hair fifty carts arrived laden with beautiful things which the lady of the tontlawald had sent to elsa and after the king's death elsa became queen and when she was old she told this story but that was the last that was ever heard of the tontlawald from ehstnische marchen the finest liar in the world at the edge of a wood there lived an old man who had only one son and one day he called the boy to him and said he wanted some corn ground but the youth must be sure never to enter any mill where the miller was beardless the boy took the corn and set out and before he had gone very far he saw a large mill in front of him with a beardless man standing in the doorway good greeting beardless one cried he good greeting sonny replied the man could i grind something here yes certainly i will finish what i am doing and then you can grind as long as you like but suddenly the boy remembered what his father had told him and bade farewell to the man and went further down the river till he came to another mill not knowing that as soon as his back was turned the beardless man had picked up a bag of corn and run hastily to the same mill before him when the boy reached the second mill and saw a second beardless man sitting there he did not stop and walked on till he came to a third mill but this time also the beardless man had been too clever for him and had arrived first by another road when it happened a fourth time the boy grew cross and said to himself it is no good going on there seems to be a beardless man in every mill and he took his sack from his back and made up his mind to grind his corn where he was the beardless man finished grinding his own corn and when he had done he said to the boy who was beginning to grind his suppose sonny we make a cake of what you have there now the boy had been rather uneasy when he recollected his father's words but he thought to himself what is done cannot be undone and answered very well so let it be then the beardless one got up threw the flour into the tub and made a hole in the middle telling the boy to fetch some water from the river in his two hands to mix the cake when the cake was ready for baking they put it on the fire and covered it with hot ashes till it was cooked through then they leaned it up against the wall for it was too big to go into a cupboard and the beardless one said to the boy look here sonny if we share this cake we shall neither of us have enough let us see who can tell the biggest lie and the one who lies the best shall have the whole cake the boy not knowing what else to do answered all right you begin so the beardless one began to lie with all his might and when he was tired of inventing new lies the boy said to him my good fellow if that is all you can do it is not much listen to me and i will tell you a true story in my youth when i was an old man we had a quantity of beehives every morning when i got up i counted them over and it was quite easy to number the bees but i never could reckon the hives properly one day as i was counting the bees i discovered that my best bee was missing and without losing a moment i saddled a cock and went out to look for him i traced him as far as the shore and knew that he had crossed the sea and that i must follow when i had reached the other side i found a man had harnessed my bee to a plough and with his help was sowing millet seed that is my bee i shouted where did you get him from brother replied the man if he is yours take him and he not only gave me back my bee but a sack of millet seed into the bargain because he had made use of my bee then i put the bag on my shoulders took the saddle from the cock and placed it on the back of the bee which i mounted leading the cock by a string so that he should have a rest as we were flying home over the sea one of the strings that held the bag of millet broke in two and the sack dropped straight into the ocean it was quite lost of course and there was no use thinking about it and by the time we were safe back again night had come i then got down from my bee and let him loose that he might get his supper gave the cock some hay and went to sleep myself but when i awoke with the sun what a scene met my eyes during the night wolves had come and had eaten my bee and honey lay ankle deep in the valley and knee deep on the hills then i began to consider how i could best collect some to take home with me now it happened that i had with me a small hatchet and this i took to the wood hoping to meet some animal which i could kill whose skin i might turn into a bag as i entered the forest i saw two roe deer hopping on one foot so i slew them with a single blow and made three bags from their skins all of which i filled with honey and placed on the back of the cock at length i reached home where i was told that my father had just been born and that i must go at once to fetch some holy water to sprinkle him with as i went i turned over in my mind if there was no way for me to get back my millet seed which had dropped into the sea and when i arrived at the place with the holy water i saw the seed had fallen on fruitful soil and was growing before my eyes and more than that it was even cut by an invisible hand and made into a cake so i took the cake as well as the holy water and was flying back with them over the sea when there fell a great rain and the sea was swollen and swept away my millet cake ah how vexed i was at its loss when i was safe on earth again suddenly i remembered that my hair was very long if i stood it touched the ground although if i was sitting it only reached my ears i seized a knife and cut off a large lock which i plaited together and when night came tied it into a knot and prepared to use it for a pillow but what was i to do for a fire a tinder box i had but no wood then it occurred to me that i had stuck a needle in my clothes so i took the needle and split it in pieces and lit it then laid myself down by the fire and went to sleep but ill luck still pursued me while i was sleeping a spark from the fire lighted on the hair which was burnt up in a moment in despair i threw myself on the ground and instantly sank in it as far as my waist i struggled to get out but only fell in further so i ran to the house seized a spade dug myself out and took home the holy water on the way i noticed that the ripe fields were full of reapers and suddenly the air became so frightfully hot that the men dropped down in a faint then i called to them why don't you bring out our mare which is as tall as two days and as broad as half a day and make a shade for yourselves my father heard what i said and jumped quickly on the mare and the reapers worked with a will in the shadow while i snatched up a wooden pail to bring them some water to drink when i got to the well everything was frozen hard so in order to draw some water i had to take off my head and break the ice with it as i drew near them carrying the water the reapers all cried out why what has become of your head i put up my hand and discovered that i really had no head and that i must have left it in the well i ran back to look for it but found that meanwhile a fox which was passing by had pulled my head out of the water and was tearing at my brains i stole cautiously up to him and gave him such a kick that he uttered a loud scream and let fall a parchment on which was written the cake is mine and the beardless one goes empty handed with these words the boy rose took the cake and went home while the beardless one remained behind to swallow his disappointment volksmarchen der serben the story of three wonderful beggars there once lived a merchant whose name was mark and whom people called mark the rich he was a very hard hearted man for he could not bear poor people and if he caught sight of a beggar anywhere near his house he would order the servants to drive him away or would set the dogs at him one day three very poor old men came begging to the door and just as he was going to let the fierce dogs loose on them his little daughter anastasia crept close up to him and said dear daddy let the poor old men sleep here to night do to please me her father could not bear to refuse her and the three beggars were allowed to sleep in a loft and at night when everyone in the house was fast asleep little anastasia got up climbed up to the loft and peeped in the three old men stood in the middle of the loft leaning on their sticks with their long grey beards flowing down over their hands and were talking together in low voices what news is there asked the eldest in the next village the peasant ivan has just had his seventh son what shall we name him and what fortune shall we give him said the second the third whispered call him vassili and give him all the property of the hard hearted man in whose loft we stand and who wanted to drive us from his door after a little more talk the three made themselves ready and crept softly away anastasia who had heard every word ran straight to her father and told him all mark was very much surprised he thought and thought and in the morning he drove to the next village to try and find out if such a child really had been born he went first to the priest and asked him about the children in his parish yesterday said the priest a boy was born in the poorest house in the village i named the unlucky little thing vassili he is the seventh son and the eldest is only seven years old and they hardly have a mouthful amongst them all who can be got to stand godfather to such a little beggar boy the merchant's heart beat fast and his mind was full of bad thoughts about that poor little baby he would be godfather himself he said and he ordered a fine christening feast so the child was brought and christened and mark was very friendly to its father after the ceremony was over he took ivan aside and said look here my friend you are a poor man how can you afford to bring up the boy give him to me and i'll make something of him and i'll give you a present of a thousand crowns is that a bargain ivan scratched his head and thought and thought and then he agreed mark counted out the money wrapped the baby up in a fox skin laid it in the sledge beside him and drove back towards home when he had driven some miles he drew up carried the child to the edge of a steep precipice and threw it over muttering there now try to take my property very soon after this some foreign merchants travelled along that same road on the way to see mark and to pay the twelve thousand crowns which they owed him as they were passing near the precipice they heard a sound of crying and on looking over they saw a little green meadow wedged in between two great heaps of snow and on the meadow lay a baby amongst the flowers the merchants picked up the child wrapped it up carefully and drove on when they saw mark they told him what a strange thing they had found mark guessed at once that the child must be his godson asked to see him and said that's a nice little fellow i should like to keep him if you will make him over to me i will let you off your debt the merchants were very pleased to make so good a bargain left the child with mark and drove off at night mark took the child put it in a barrel fastened the lid tight down and threw it into the sea the barrel floated away to a great distance and at last it floated close up to a monastery the monks were just spreading out their nets to dry on the shore when they heard the sound of crying it seemed to come from the barrel which was bobbing about near the water's edge they drew it to land and opened it and there was a little child when the abbot heard the news he decided to bring up the boy and named him vassili the boy lived on with the monks and grew up to be a clever gentle and handsome young man no one could read write or sing better than he and he did everything so well that the abbot made him wardrobe keeper now it happened about this time that the merchant mark came to the monastery in the course of a journey the monks were very polite to him and showed him their house and church and all they had when he went into the church the choir was singing and one voice was so clear and beautiful that he asked who it belonged to then the abbot told him of the wonderful way in which vassili had come to them and mark saw clearly that this must be his godson whom he had twice tried to kill he said to the abbot i can't tell you how much i enjoy that young man's singing if he could only come to me i would make him overseer of all my business as you say he is so good and clever do spare him to me i will make his fortune and will present your monastery with twenty thousand crowns the abbot hesitated a good deal but he consulted all the other monks and at last they decided that they ought not to stand in the way of vassili's good fortune then mark wrote a letter to his wife and gave it to vassili to take to her and this was what was in the letter when the bearer of this arrives take him into the soap factory and when you pass near the great boiler push him in if you don't obey my orders i shall be very angry for this young man is a bad fellow who is sure to ruin us all if he lives vassili had a good voyage and on landing set off on foot for mark's home on the way he met three beggars who asked him where are you going vassili i am going to the house of mark the merchant and have a letter for his wife replied vassili show us the letter vassili handed them the letter they blew on it and gave it back to him saying now go and give the letter to mark's wife you will not be forsaken vassili reached the house and gave the letter when the mistress read it she could hardly believe her eyes and called for her daughter in the letter was written quite plainly when you receive this letter get ready for a wedding and let the bearer be married next day to my daughter anastasia if you don't obey my orders i shall be very angry anastasia saw the bearer of the letter and he pleased her very much they dressed vassili in fine clothes and next day he was married to anastasia in due time mark returned from his travels his wife daughter and son in law all went out to meet him when mark saw vassili he flew into a terrible rage with his wife how dared you marry my daughter without my consent he asked i only carried out your orders said she here is your letter mark read it it certainly was his handwriting but by no means his wishes well thought he you've escaped me three times but i think i shall get the better of you now and he waited a month and was very kind and pleasant to his daughter and her husband at the end of that time he said to vassili one day i want you to go for me to my friend the serpent king in his beautiful country at the world's end twelve years ago he built a castle on some land of mine i want you to ask for the rent for those twelve years and also to find out from him what has become of my twelve ships which sailed for his country three years ago vassili dared not disobey he said good bye to his young wife who cried bitterly at parting hung a bag of biscuits over his shoulders and set out i really cannot tell you whether the journey was long or short as he tramped along he suddenly heard a voice saying vassili where are you going vassili looked about him and seeing no one called out who spoke to me i did this old wide spreading oak tell me where you are going i am going to the serpent king to receive twelve years rent from him when the time comes remember me and ask the king rotten to the roots half dead but still green stands the old oak is it to stand much longer on the earth vassili went on further he came to a river and got into the ferryboat the old ferryman asked are you going far my friend i am going to the serpent king then think of me and say to the king for thirty years the ferryman has rowed to and fro will the tired old man have to row much longer very well said vassili i'll ask him and he walked on in time he came to a narrow strait of the sea and across it lay a great whale over whose back people walked and drove as if it had been a bridge or a road as he stepped on it the whale said do tell me where you are going i am going to the serpent king and the whale begged think of me and say to the king the poor whale has been lying three years across the strait and men and horses have nearly trampled his back into his ribs is he to lie there much longer i will remember said vassili and he went on he walked and walked and walked till he came to a great green meadow in the meadow stood a large and splendid castle its white marble walls sparkled in the light the roof was covered with mother o pearl which shone like a rainbow and the sun glowed like fire on the crystal windows vassili walked in and went from one room to another astonished at all the splendour he saw when he reached the last room of all he found a beautiful girl sitting on a bed as soon as she saw him she said oh vassili what brings you to this accursed place vassili told her why he had come and all he had seen and heard on the way the girl said you have not been sent here to collect rents but for your own destruction and that the serpent may devour you she had not time to say more when the whole castle shook and a rustling hissing groaning sound was heard the girl quickly pushed vassili into a chest under the bed locked it and whispered listen to what the serpent and i talk about then she rose up to receive the serpent king the monster rushed into the room and threw itself panting on the bed crying i've flown half over the world i'm tired very tired and want to sleep scratch my head the beautiful girl sat down near him stroking his hideous head and said in a sweet coaxing voice you know everything in the world after you left i had such a wonderful dream will you tell me what it means out with it then quick what was it i dreamt i was walking on a wide road and an oak tree said to me ask the king this rotten at the roots half dead and yet green stands the old oak is it to stand much longer on the earth it must stand till some one comes and pushes it down with his foot then it will fall and under its roots will be found more gold and silver than even mark the rich has got then i dreamt i came to a river and the old ferryman said to me for thirty year's the ferryman has rowed to and fro will the tired old man have to row much longer that depends on himself if some one gets into the boat to be ferried across the old man has only to push the boat off and go his way without looking back the man in the boat will then have to take his place and at last i dreamt that i was walking over a bridge made of a whale's back and the living bridge spoke to me and said here have i been stretched out these three years and men and horses have trampled my back down into my ribs must i lie here much longer he will have to lie there till he has thrown up the twelve ships of mark the rich which he swallowed then he may plunge back into the sea and heal his back and the serpent king closed his eyes turned round on his other side and began to snore so loud that the windows rattled in all haste the lovely girl helped vassili out of the chest and showed him part of his way back he thanked her very politely and hurried off when he reached the strait the whale asked have you thought of me yes as soon as i am on the other side i will tell you what you want to know when he was on the other side vassili said to the whale throw up those twelve ships of mark's which you swallowed three years ago the great fish heaved itself up and threw up all the twelve ships and their crews then he shook himself for joy and plunged into the sea vassili went on further till he reached the ferry where the old man asked did you think of me yes and as soon as you have ferried me across i will tell you what you want to know when they had crossed over vassili said let the next man who comes stay in the boat but do you step on shore push the boat off and you will be free and the other man must take your place then vassili went on further still and soon came to the old oak tree pushed it with his foot and it fell over there at the roots was more gold and silver than even mark the rich had and now the twelve ships which the whale had thrown up came sailing along and anchored close by on the deck of the first ship stood the three beggars whom vassili had met formerly and they said heaven has blessed you vassili then they vanished away and he never saw them again the sailors carried all the gold and silver into the ship and then they set sail for home with vassili on board mark was more furious than ever he had his horses harnessed and drove off himself to see the serpent king and to complain of the way in which he had been betrayed when he reached the river he sprang into the ferryboat the ferryman however did not get in but pushed the boat off vassili led a good and happy life with his dear wife and his kind mother in law lived with them he helped the poor and fed and clothed the hungry and naked and all mark's riches became his for many years mark has been ferrying people across the river his face is wrinkled his hair and beard are snow white and his eyes are dim but still he rows on from the serbian schippeitaro it was the custom in old times that as soon as a japanese boy reached manhood he should leave his home and roam through the land in search of adventures sometimes he would meet with a young man bent on the same business as himself and then they would fight in a friendly manner merely to prove which was the stronger but on other occasions the enemy would turn out to be a robber who had become the terror of the neighbourhood and then the battle was in deadly earnest one day a youth started off from his native village resolved never to come back till he had done some great deed that would make his name famous but adventures did not seem very plentiful just then and he wandered about for a long time without meeting either with fierce giants or distressed damsels at last he saw in the distance a wild mountain half covered with a dense forest and thinking that this promised well at once took the road that led to it the difficulties he met with huge rocks to be climbed deep rivers to be crossed and thorny tracts to be avoided only served to make his heart beat quicker for he was really brave all through and not merely when he could not help himself like a great many people but in spite of all his efforts he could not find his way out of the forest and he began to think he should have to pass the night there once more he strained his eyes to see if there was no place in which he could take shelter and this time he caught sight of a small chapel in a little clearing he hastened quickly towards it and curling himself up in a warm corner soon fell asleep not a sound was heard through the whole forest for some hours but at midnight there suddenly arose such a clamour that the young man tired as he was started broad awake in an instant peeping cautiously between the wooden pillars of the chapel he saw a troop of hideous cats dancing furiously making the night horrible with their yells the full moon lighted up the weird scene and the young warrior gazed with astonishment taking great care to keep still lest he should be discovered after some time he thought that in the midst of all their shrieks he could make out the words do not tell schippeitaro keep it hidden and secret do not tell schippeitaro then the midnight hour having passed they all vanished and the youth was left alone exhausted by all that had been going on round him he flung himself on the ground and slept till the sun rose the moment he woke he felt very hungry and began to think how he could get something to eat so he got up and walked on and before he had gone very far was lucky enough to find a little side path where he could trace men's footsteps he followed the track and by and by came on some scattered huts beyond which lay a village delighted at this discovery he was about to hasten to the village when he heard a woman's voice weeping and lamenting and calling on the men to take pity on her and help her the sound of her distress made him forget he was hungry and he strode into the"
