whom we wish to punish through the boy will be gone and he will then be to us only a constant source of danger and embarrassment you see therefore that you may only save the life of your son by saving your own and you can only save your own by giving us the cheque we ask very well replied tarzan for he knew that he could trust them to carry out any sinister threat that paulvitch had made and there was a bare chance that by conceding their demands he might save the boy that they would permit him to live after he had appended his name to the cheque never occurred to him as being within the realms of probability but he was determined to give them such a battle as they would never forget and possibly to take paulvitch with him into eternity he was only sorry that it was not rokoff he took his pocket cheque book and fountain pen from his pocket what is the amount he asked paulvitch named an enormous sum tarzan could scarce restrain a smile their very cupidity was to prove the means of their undoing in the matter of the ransom at least purposely he hesitated and haggled over the amount but paulvitch was obdurate finally the ape man wrote out his cheque for a larger sum than stood to his credit at the bank as he turned to hand the worthless slip of paper to the russian his glance chanced to pass across the starboard bow of the kincaid to his surprise he saw that the ship lay within a few hundred yards of land almost down to the water's edge ran a dense tropical jungle and behind was higher land clothed in forest paulvitch noted the direction of his gaze you are to be set at liberty here he said tarzan's plan for immediate physical revenge upon the russian vanished he thought the land before him the mainland of africa and he knew that should they liberate him here he could doubtless find his way to civilization with comparative ease paulvitch took the cheque remove your clothing he said to the ape man here you will not need it tarzan demurred paulvitch pointed to the armed sailors then the englishman slowly divested himself of his clothing a boat was lowered and still heavily guarded the ape man was rowed ashore half an hour later the sailors had returned to the kincaid and the steamer was slowly getting under way as tarzan stood upon the narrow strip of beach watching the departure of the vessel he saw a figure appear at the rail and call aloud to attract his attention the ape man had been about to read a note that one of the sailors had handed him as the small boat that bore him to the shore was on the point of returning to the steamer but at the hail from the vessel's deck he looked up he saw a black bearded man who laughed at him in derision as he held high above his head the figure of a little child tarzan half started as though to rush through the surf and strike out for the already moving steamer but realizing the futility of so rash an act he halted at the water's edge thus he stood his gaze riveted upon the kincaid until it disappeared beyond a projecting promontory of the coast from the jungle at his back fierce bloodshot eyes glared from beneath shaggy overhanging brows upon him little monkeys in the tree tops chattered and scolded and from the distance of the inland forest came the scream of a leopard but still john clayton lord greystoke stood deaf and unseeing suffering the pangs of keen regret for the opportunity that he had wasted because he had been so gullible as to place credence in a single statement of the first lieutenant of his arch enemy i have at least he thought one consolation the knowledge that jane is safe in london thank heaven she too did not fall into the clutches of those villains behind him the hairy thing whose evil eyes had been watching him as a cat watches a mouse was creeping stealthily toward him where were the trained senses of the savage ape man where the acute hearing where the uncanny sense of scent chapter 3 beasts at bay slowly tarzan unfolded the note the sailor had thrust into his hand and read it at first it made little impression on his sorrow numbed senses but finally the full purport of the hideous plot of revenge unfolded itself before his imagination this will explain to you the note read the exact nature of my intentions relative to your offspring and to you you were born an ape you lived naked in the jungles to your own we have returned you but your son shall rise a step above his sire it is the immutable law of evolution the father was a beast but the son shall be a man he shall take the next ascending step in the scale of progress he shall be no naked beast of the jungle but shall wear a loin cloth and copper anklets and perchance a ring in his nose for he is to be reared by men a tribe of savage cannibals i might have killed you but that would have curtailed the full measure of the punishment you have earned at my hands dead you could not have suffered in the knowledge of your son's plight but living and in a place from which you may not escape to seek or succour your child you shall suffer worse than death for all the years of your life in contemplation of the horrors of your son's existence this then is to be a part of your punishment for having dared to pit yourself against n r p.s the balance of your punishment has to do with what shall presently befall your wife that i shall leave to your imagination as he finished reading a slight sound behind him brought him back with a start to the world of present realities instantly his senses awoke and he was again tarzan of the apes as he wheeled about it was a beast at bay vibrant with the instinct of self preservation that faced a huge bull ape that was already charging down upon him the two years that had elapsed since tarzan had come out of the savage forest with his rescued mate had witnessed slight diminution of the mighty powers that had made him the invincible lord of the jungle his great estates in uziri had claimed much of his time and attention and there he had found ample field for the practical use and retention of his almost superhuman powers but naked and unarmed to do battle with the shaggy bull necked beast that now confronted him was a test that the ape man would scarce have welcomed at any period of his wild existence but there was no alternative other than to meet the rage maddened creature with the weapons with which nature had endowed him over the bull's shoulder tarzan could see now the heads and shoulders of perhaps a dozen more of these mighty fore runners of primitive man he knew however that there was little chance that they would attack him since it is not within the reasoning powers of the anthropoid to be able to weigh or appreciate the value of concentrated action against an enemy otherwise they would long since have become the dominant creatures of their haunts so tremendous a power of destruction lies in their mighty thews and savage fangs with a low snarl the beast now hurled himself at tarzan but the ape man had found among other things in the haunts of civilized man certain methods of scientific warfare that are unknown to the jungle folk whereas a few years since he would have met the brute rush with brute force he now sidestepped his antagonist's headlong charge and as the brute hurtled past him swung a mighty right to the pit of the ape's stomach with a howl of mingled rage and anguish the great anthropoid bent double and sank to the ground though almost instantly he was again struggling to his feet before he could regain them however his white skinned foe had wheeled and pounced upon him and in the act there dropped from the shoulders of the english lord the last shred of his superficial mantle of civilization once again he was the jungle beast revelling in bloody conflict with his kind once again he was tarzan son of kala the she ape his strong white teeth sank into the hairy throat of his enemy as he sought the pulsing jugular powerful fingers held the mighty fangs from his own flesh or clenched and beat with the power of a steam hammer upon the snarling foam flecked face of his adversary in a circle about them the balance of the tribe of apes stood watching and enjoying the struggle they muttered low gutturals of approval as bits of white hide or hairy bloodstained skin were torn from one contestant or the other but they were silent in amazement and expectation when they saw the mighty white ape wriggle upon the back of their king and with steel muscles tensed beneath the armpits of his antagonist bear down mightily with his open palms upon the back of the thick bullneck so that the king ape could but shriek in agony and flounder helplessly about upon the thick mat of jungle grass as tarzan had overcome the huge terkoz that time years before when he had been about to set out upon his quest for human beings of his own kind and colour so now he overcame this other great ape with the same wrestling hold upon which he had stumbled by accident during that other combat the little audience of fierce anthropoids heard the creaking of their king's neck mingling with his agonized shrieks and hideous roaring then there came a sudden crack like the breaking of a stout limb before the fury of the wind the bullet head crumpled forward upon its flaccid neck against the great hairy chest the roaring and the shrieking ceased the little pig eyes of the onlookers wandered from the still form of their leader to that of the white ape that was rising to its feet beside the vanquished then back to their king as though in wonder that he did not arise and slay this presumptuous stranger they saw the new comer place a foot upon the neck of the quiet figure at his feet and throwing back his head give vent to the wild uncanny challenge of the bull ape that has made a kill then they knew that their king was dead across the jungle rolled the horrid notes of the victory cry the little monkeys in the tree tops ceased their chattering the harsh voiced brilliant plumed birds were still from afar came the answering wail of a leopard and the deep roar of a lion it was the old tarzan who turned questioning eyes upon the little knot of apes before him it was the old tarzan who shook his head as though to toss back a heavy mane that had fallen before his face an old habit dating from the days that his great shock of thick black hair had fallen about his shoulders and often tumbled before his eyes when it had meant life or death to him to have his vision unobstructed the ape man knew that he might expect an immediate attack on the part of that particular surviving bull ape who felt himself best fitted to contend for the kingship of the tribe among his own apes he knew that it was not unusual for an entire stranger to enter a community and after having dispatched the king assume the leadership of the tribe himself together with the fallen monarch's mates on the other hand if he made no attempt to follow them they might move slowly away from him later to fight among themselves for the supremacy that he could be king of them if he so chose he was confident but he was not sure he cared to assume the sometimes irksome duties of that position for he could see no particular advantage to be gained thereby one of the younger apes a huge splendidly muscled brute was edging threateningly closer to the ape man through his bared fighting fangs there issued a low sullen growl tarzan watched his every move standing rigid as a statue to have fallen back a step would have been to precipitate an immediate charge to have rushed forward to meet the other might have had the same result or it might have put the bellicose one to flight it all depended upon the young bull's stock of courage to stand perfectly still waiting was the middle course in this event the bull would according to custom approach quite close to the object of his attention growling hideously and baring slavering fangs slowly he would circle about the other as though with a chip upon his shoulder and this he did even as tarzan had foreseen it might be a bluff royal or on the other hand so unstable is the mind of an ape a passing impulse might hurl the hairy mass tearing and rending upon the man without an instant's warning as the brute circled him tarzan turned slowly keeping his eyes ever upon the eyes of his antagonist he had appraised the young bull as one who had never quite felt equal to the task of overthrowing his former king but who one day would have done so tarzan saw that the beast was of wondrous proportions standing over seven feet upon his short bowed legs his great hairy arms reached almost to the ground even when he stood erect and his fighting fangs now quite close to tarzan's face were exceptionally long and sharp like the others of his tribe he differed in several minor essentials from the apes of tarzan's boyhood at first the ape man had experienced a thrill of hope at sight of the shaggy bodies of the anthropoids a hope that by some strange freak of fate he had been again returned to his own tribe but a closer inspection had convinced him that these were another species as the threatening bull continued his stiff and jerky circling of the ape man much after the manner that you have noted among dogs when a strange canine comes among them it occurred to tarzan to discover if the language of his own tribe was identical with that of this other family and so he addressed the brute in the language of the tribe of kerchak who are you he asked who threatens tarzan of the apes the hairy brute looked his surprise i am akut replied the other in the same simple primal tongue which is so low in the scale of spoken languages that as tarzan had surmised it was identical with that of the tribe in which the first twenty years of his life had been spent i am akut said the ape molak is dead i am king go away or i shall kill you you saw how easily i killed molak replied tarzan so i could kill you if i cared to be king but tarzan of the apes would not be king of the tribe of akut all he wishes is to live in peace in this country let us be friends tarzan of the apes can help you and you can help tarzan of the apes you cannot kill akut replied the other none is so great as akut had you not killed molak akut would have done so for akut was ready to be king for answer the ape man hurled himself upon the great brute who during the conversation had slightly relaxed his vigilance in the twinkling of an eye the man had seized the wrist of the great ape and before the other could grapple with him had whirled him about and leaped upon his broad back down they went together but so well had tarzan's plan worked out that before ever they touched the ground he had gained the same hold upon akut that had broken molak's neck slowly he brought the pressure to bear and then as in days gone by he had given kerchak the chance to surrender and live so now he gave to akut in whom he saw a possible ally of great strength and resource the option of living in amity with him or dying as he had just seen his savage and heretofore invincible king die ka goda whispered tarzan to the ape beneath him it was the same question that he had whispered to kerchak and in the language of the apes it means broadly do you surrender akut thought of the creaking sound he had heard just before molak's thick neck had snapped and he shuddered he hated to give up the kingship though so again he struggled to free himself but a sudden torturing pressure upon his vertebra brought an agonized ka goda from his lips tarzan relaxed his grip a trifle you may still be king akut he said tarzan told you that he did not wish to be king if any question your right tarzan of the apes will help you in your battles the ape man rose and akut came slowly to his feet shaking his bullet head and growling angrily he waddled toward his tribe looking first at one and then at another of the larger bulls who might be expected to challenge his leadership but none did so instead they drew away as he approached and presently the whole pack moved off into the jungle and tarzan was left alone once more upon the beach the ape man was sore from the wounds that molak had inflicted upon him but he was inured to physical suffering and endured it with the calm and fortitude of the wild beasts that had taught him to lead the jungle life after the manner of all those that are born to it his first need he realized was for weapons of offence and defence for his encounter with the apes and the distant notes of the savage voices of numa the lion and sheeta the panther warned him that his was to be no life of indolent ease and security it was but a return to the old existence of constant bloodshed and danger to the hunting and the being hunted grim beasts would stalk him as they had stalked him in the past and never would there be a moment by savage day or by cruel night that he might not have instant need of such crude weapons as he could fashion from the materials at hand upon the shore he found an out cropping of brittle igneous rock by dint of much labour he managed to chip off a narrow sliver some twelve inches long by a quarter of an inch thick one edge was quite thin for a few inches near the tip it was the rudiment of a knife with it he went into the jungle searching until he found a fallen tree of a certain species of hardwood with which he was familiar from this he cut a small straight branch which he pointed at one end then he scooped a small round hole in the surface of the prostrate trunk into this he crumbled a few bits of dry bark minutely shredded after which he inserted the tip of his pointed stick and sitting astride the bole of the tree spun the slender rod rapidly between his palms after a time a thin smoke rose from the little mass of tinder and a moment later the whole broke into flame heaping some larger twigs and sticks upon the tiny fire tarzan soon had quite a respectable blaze roaring in the enlarging cavity of the dead tree into this he thrust the blade of his stone knife and as it became superheated he would withdraw it touching a spot near the thin edge with a drop of moisture beneath the wetted area a little flake of the glassy material would crack and scale away thus very slowly the ape man commenced the tedious operation of putting a thin edge upon his primitive hunting knife he did not attempt to accomplish the feat all in one sitting at first he was content to achieve a cutting edge of a couple of inches with which he cut a long pliable bow a handle for his knife a stout cudgel and a goodly supply of arrows these he cached in a tall tree beside a little stream and here also he constructed a platform with a roof of palm leaves above it when all these things had been finished it was growing dusk and tarzan felt a strong desire to eat he had noted during the brief incursion he had made into the forest that a short distance up stream from his tree there was a much used watering place where from the trampled mud of either bank it was evident beasts of all sorts and in great numbers came to drink to this spot the hungry ape man made his silent way through the upper terrace of the tree tops he swung with the grace and ease of a monkey but for the heavy burden upon his heart he would have been happy in this return to the old free life of his boyhood yet even with that burden he fell into the little habits and manners of his early life that were in reality more a part of him than the thin veneer of civilization that the past three years of his association with the white men of the outer world had spread lightly over him a veneer that only hid the crudities of the beast that tarzan of the apes had been could his fellow peers of the house of lords have seen him then they would have held up their noble hands in holy horror silently he crouched in the lower branches of a great forest giant that overhung the trail his keen eyes and sensitive ears strained into the distant jungle from which he knew his dinner would presently emerge nor had he long to wait scarce had he settled himself to a comfortable position his lithe muscular legs drawn well up beneath him as the panther draws his hindquarters in preparation for the spring than bara the deer came daintily down to drink but more than bara was coming behind the graceful buck came another which the deer could neither see nor scent but whose movements were apparent to tarzan of the apes because of the elevated position of the ape man's ambush he knew not yet exactly the nature of the thing that moved so stealthily through the jungle a few hundred yards behind the deer but he was convinced that it was some great beast of prey stalking bara for the selfsame purpose as that which prompted him to await the fleet animal numa perhaps or sheeta the panther in any event tarzan could see his repast slipping from his grasp unless bara moved more rapidly toward the ford than at present even as these thoughts passed through his mind some noise of the stalker in his rear must have come to the buck for with a sudden start he paused for an instant trembling in his tracks and then with a swift bound dashed straight for the river and tarzan it was his intention to flee through the shallow ford and escape upon the opposite side of the river not a hundred yards behind him came numa tarzan could see him quite plainly now below the ape man bara was about to pass could he do it but even as he asked himself the question the hungry man launched himself from his perch full upon the back of the startled buck in another instant numa would be upon them both so if the ape man were to dine that night or ever again he must act quickly scarcely had he touched the sleek hide of the deer with a momentum that sent the animal to its knees than he had grasped a horn in either hand and with a single quick wrench twisted the animal's neck completely round until he felt the vertebrae snap beneath his grip the lion was roaring in rage close behind him as he swung the deer across his shoulder and grasping a foreleg between his strong teeth leaped for the nearest of the lower branches that swung above his head with both hands he grasped the limb and at the instant that numa sprang drew himself and his prey out of reach of the animal's cruel talons there was a thud below him as the baffled cat fell back to earth and then tarzan of the apes drawing his dinner farther up to the safety of a higher limb looked down with grinning face into the gleaming yellow eyes of the other wild beast that glared up at him from beneath and with taunting insults flaunted the tender carcass of his kill in the face of him whom he had cheated of it with his crude stone knife he cut a juicy steak from the hindquarters and while the great lion paced growling back and forth below him lord greystoke filled his savage belly nor ever in the choicest of his exclusive london clubs had a meal tasted more palatable the warm blood of his kill smeared his hands and face and filled his nostrils with the scent that the savage carnivora love best and when he had finished he left the balance of the carcass in a high fork of the tree where he had dined and with numa trailing below him still keen for revenge he made his way back to his tree top shelter where he slept until the sun was high the following morning chapter 4 sheeta the next few days were occupied by tarzan in completing his weapons and exploring the jungle he strung his bow with tendons from the buck upon which he had dined his first evening upon the new shore and though he would have preferred the gut of sheeta for the purpose he was content to wait until opportunity permitted him to kill one of the great cats he also braided a long grass rope such a rope as he had used so many years before to tantalize the ill natured tublat and which later had developed into a wondrous effective weapon in the practised hands of the little ape boy a sheath and handle for his hunting knife he fashioned and a quiver for arrows and from the hide of bara a belt and loin cloth then he set out to learn something of the strange land in which he found himself that it was not his old familiar west coast of the african continent he knew from the fact that it faced east the rising sun came up out of the sea before the threshold of the jungle but that it was not the east coast of africa he was equally positive for he felt satisfied that the kincaid had not passed through the mediterranean the suez canal and the red sea nor had she had time to round the cape of good hope so he was quite at a loss to know where he might be sometimes he wondered if the ship had crossed the broad atlantic to deposit him upon some wild south american shore but the presence of numa the lion decided him that such could not be the case as tarzan made his lonely way through the jungle paralleling the shore he felt strong upon him a desire for companionship so that gradually he commenced to regret that he had not cast his lot with the apes he had seen nothing of them since that first day when the influences of civilization were still paramount within him now he was more nearly returned to the tarzan of old and though he appreciated the fact that there could be little in common between himself and the great anthropoids still they were better than no company at all moving leisurely sometimes upon the ground and again among the lower branches of the trees gathering an occasional fruit or turning over a fallen log in search of the larger bugs which he still found as palatable as of old tarzan had covered a mile or more when his attention was attracted by the scent of sheeta up wind ahead of him now sheeta the panther was one whom tarzan was exceptionally glad to fall in with for he had it in mind not only to utilize the great cat's strong gut for his bow but also to fashion a new quiver and loin cloth from pieces of his hide so whereas the ape man had gone carelessly before he now became the personification of noiseless stealth swiftly and silently he glided through the forest in the wake of the savage cat nor was the pursuer for all his noble birth one whit less savage than the wild fierce thing he stalked as he came closer"
