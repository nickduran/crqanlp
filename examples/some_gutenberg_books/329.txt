"1" "length the rest were like graven images they stared at me dumb and sorrowful with their bright eyes and it came upon me things would look not much different if i were on the platform of the gallows and these good folk had come to see me hanged i felt i was getting daunted and began to be afraid i looked it which would never do up i stood made believe to stretch myself came down the verandah stair and strolled towards the river there went a short buzz from one to the other like what you hear in theatres when the curtain goes up and some of the nearest gave back the matter of a pace i saw a girl lay one hand on a young man and make a gesture upward with the other at the same time she said something in the native with a gasping voice three little boys sat beside my path where i must pass within three feet of them wrapped in their sheets with their shaved heads and bits of top knots and queer faces they looked like figures on a chimney piece awhile they sat their ground solemn as judges i came up hand over fist doing my five knots like a man that meant business and i thought i saw a sort of a wink and gulp in the three faces then one jumped up he was the farthest off and ran for his mammy the other two trying to follow suit got foul came to ground together bawling wriggled right out of their sheets mother naked and in a moment there were all three of them scampering for their lives and singing out like pigs the natives who would never let a joke slip even at a burial laughed and let up as short as a dog’s bark they say it scares a man to be alone no such thing what scares him in the dark or the high bush is that he can’t make sure and there might be an army at his elbow what scares him worst is to be right in the midst of a crowd and have no guess of what they’re driving at when that laugh stopped i stopped too the boys had not yet made their offing they were still on the full stretch going the one way when i had already gone about ship and was sheering off the other like a fool i had come out doing my five knots like a fool i went back again it must have been the funniest thing to see and what knocked me silly this time no one laughed only one old woman gave a kind of pious moan the way you have heard dissenters in their chapels at the sermon i never saw such fools of kanakas as your people here i said once to uma glancing out of the window at the starers savvy nothing says uma with a kind of disgusted air that she was good at and that was all the talk we had upon the matter for i was put out and uma took the thing so much as a matter of course that i was fairly ashamed all day off and on now fewer and now more the fools sat about the west end of my house and across the river waiting for the show whatever that was fire to come down from heaven i suppose and consume me bones and baggage but by evening like real islanders they had wearied of the business and got away and had a dance instead in the big house of the village where i heard them singing and clapping hands till maybe ten at night and the next day it seemed they had forgotten i existed if fire had come down from heaven or the earth opened and swallowed me there would have been nobody to see the sport or take the lesson or whatever you like to call it but i was to find they hadn’t forgot either and kept an eye lifting for phenomena over my way i was hard at it both these days getting my trade in order and taking stock of what vigours had left this was a job that made me pretty sick and kept me from thinking on much else ben had taken stock the trip before i knew i could trust ben but it was plain somebody had been making free in the meantime i found i was out by what might easily cover six months salary and profit and i could have kicked myself all round the village to have been such a blamed ass sitting boozing with that case instead of attending to my own affairs and taking stock however there’s no use crying over spilt milk it was done now and couldn’t be undone all i could do was to get what was left of it and my new stuff my own choice in order to go round and get after the rats and cockroaches and to fix up that store regular sydney style a fine show i made of it and the third morning when i had lit my pipe and stood in the door way and looked in and turned and looked far up the mountain and saw the cocoanuts waving and posted up the tons of copra and over the village green and saw the island dandies and reckoned up the yards of print they wanted for their kilts and dresses i felt as if i was in the right place to make a fortune and go home again and start a public house there was i sitting in that verandah in as handsome a piece of scenery as you could find a splendid sun and a fine fresh healthy trade that stirred up a man’s blood like sea bathing and the whole thing was clean gone from me and i was dreaming england which is after all a nasty cold muddy hole with not enough light to see to read by and dreaming the looks of my public by a cant of a broad high road like an avenue and with the sign on a green tree so much for the morning but the day passed and the devil anyone looked near me and from all i knew of natives in other islands i thought this strange people laughed a little at our firm and their fine stations and at this station of falesá in particular all the copra in the district wouldn’t pay for it i had heard them say in fifty years which i supposed was an exaggeration but when the day went and no business came at all i began to get downhearted and about three in the afternoon i went out for a stroll to cheer me up on the green i saw a white man coming with a cassock on by which and by the face of him i knew he was a priest he was a good natured old soul to look at gone a little grizzled and so dirty you could have written with him on a piece of paper good day sir said i he answered me eagerly in native don’t you speak any english said i french says he well said i i’m sorry but i can’t do anything there he tried me awhile in the french and then again in native which he seemed to think was the best chance i made out he was after more than passing the time of day with me but had something to communicate and i listened the harder i heard the names of adams and case and of randall randall the oftenest and the word poison or something like it and a native word that he said very often i went home repeating it to myself what does fussy ocky mean i asked of uma for that was as near as i could come to it make dead said she the devil it does says i did ever you hear that case had poisoned johnnie adams every man he savvy that says uma scornful like give him white sand bad sand he got the bottle still suppose he give you gin you no take him now i had heard much the same sort of story in other islands and the same white powder always to the front which made me think the less of it for all that i went over to randall’s place to see what i could pick up and found case on the doorstep cleaning a gun good shooting here says i a 1 says he the bush is full of all kinds of birds i wish copra was as plenty says he i thought slyly but there don’t seem anything doing i could see black jack in the store serving a customer that looks like business though said i that’s the first sale we’ve made in three weeks said he you don’t tell me says i three weeks well well if you don’t believe me he cries a little hot you can go and look at the copra house it’s half empty to this blessed hour i shouldn’t be much the better for that you see says i for all i can tell it might have been whole empty yesterday that’s so says he with a bit of a laugh by the bye i said what sort of a party is that priest seems rather a friendly sort at this case laughed right out loud ah says he i see what ails you now galuchet’s been at you _father galoshes_ was the name he went by most but case always gave it the french quirk which was another reason we had for thinking him above the common yes i have seen him i says i made out he didn’t think much of your captain randall that he don’t says case it was the trouble about poor adams the last day when he lay dying there was young buncombe round ever met buncombe i told him no he’s a cure is buncombe laughs case well buncombe took it in his head that as there was no other clergyman about bar kanaka pastors we ought to call in father galuchet and have the old man administered and take the sacrament it was all the same to me you may suppose but i said i thought adams was the fellow to consult he was jawing away about watered copra and a sight of foolery look here i said you’re pretty sick would you like to see galoshes he sat right up on his elbow get the priest says he get the priest don’t let me die here like a dog he spoke kind of fierce and eager but sensible enough there was nothing to say against that so we sent and asked galuchet if he would come you bet he would he jumped in his dirty linen at the thought of it but we had reckoned without papa he’s a hard shell baptist is papa no papists need apply and he took and locked the door buncombe told him he was bigoted and i thought he would have had a fit bigoted he says me bigoted have i lived to hear it from a jackanapes like you and he made for buncombe and i had to hold them apart and there was adams in the middle gone luny again and carrying on about copra like a born fool it was good as the play and i was about knocked out of time with laughing when all of a sudden adams sat up clapped his hands to his chest and went into the horrors he died hard did john adams says case with a kind of a sudden sternness and what became of the priest i asked the priest says case o he was hammering on the door outside and crying on the natives to come and beat it in and singing out it was a soul he wished to save and that he was in a rare taking was the priest but what would you have johnny had slipped his cable no more johnny in the market and the administration racket clean played out next thing word came to randall the priest was praying upon johnny’s grave papa was pretty full and got a club and lit out straight for the place and there was galoshes on his knees and a lot of natives looking on you wouldn’t think papa cared that much about anything unless it was liquor but he and the priest stuck to it two hours slanging each other in native and every time galoshes tried to kneel down papa went for him with the club there never were such larks in falesá the end of it was that captain randall knocked over with some kind of a fit or stroke and the priest got in his goods after all but he was the angriest priest you ever heard of and complained to the chiefs about the outrage as he called it that was no account for our chiefs are protestant here and anyway he had been making trouble about the drum for morning school and they were glad to give him a wipe now he swears old randall gave adams poison or something and when the two meet they grin at each other like baboons he told this story as natural as could be and like a man that enjoyed the fun though now i come to think of it after so long it seems rather a sickening yarn however case never set up to be soft only to be square and hearty and a man all round and to tell the truth he puzzled me entirely i went home and asked uma if she were a popey which i had made out to be the native word for catholics _e le ai_ says she she always used the native when she meant no more than usually strong and indeed there’s more of it no good popey she added then i asked her about adams and the priest and she told me much the same yarn in her own way so that i was left not much farther on but inclined upon the whole to think the bottom of the matter was the row about the sacrament and the poisoning only talk the next day was a sunday when there was no business to be looked for uma asked me in the morning if i was going to pray i told her she bet not and she stopped home herself with no more words i thought this seemed unlike a native and a native woman and a woman that had new clothes to show off however it suited me to the ground and i made the less of it the queer thing was that i came next door to going to church after all a thing i’m little likely to forget i had turned out for a stroll and heard the hymn tune up you know how it is if you hear folk singing it seems to draw you and pretty soon i found myself alongside the church it was a little long low place coral built rounded off at both ends like a whale boat a big native roof on the top of it windows without sashes and doorways without doors i stuck my head into one of the windows and the sight was so new to me for things went quite different in the islands i was acquainted with that i stayed and looked on the congregation sat on the floor on mats the women on one side the men on the other all rigged out to kill the women with dresses and trade hats the men in white jackets and shirts the hymn was over the pastor a big buck kanaka was in the pulpit preaching for his life and by the way he wagged his hand and worked his voice and made his points and seemed to argue with the folk i made out he was a gun at the business well he looked up suddenly and caught my eye and i give you my word he staggered in the pulpit his eyes bulged out of his head his hand rose and pointed at me like as if against his will and the sermon stopped right there it isn’t a fine thing to say for yourself but i ran away and if the same kind of a shock was given me i should run away again to morrow to see that palavering kanaka struck all of a heap at the mere sight of me gave me a feeling as if the bottom had dropped out of the world i went right home and stayed there and said nothing you might think i would tell uma but that was against my system you might have thought i would have gone over and consulted case but the truth was i was ashamed to speak of such a thing i thought everyone would blurt out laughing in my face so i held my tongue and thought all the more and the more i thought the less i liked the business by monday night i got it clearly in my head i must be tabooed a new store to stand open two days in a village and not a man or woman come to see the trade was past believing uma said i i think i’m tabooed i think so said she i thought awhile whether i should ask her more but it’s a bad idea to set natives up with any notion of consulting them so i went to case it was dark and he was sitting alone as he did mostly smoking on the stairs case said i here’s a queer thing i’m tabooed o fudge says he tain’t the practice in these islands that may be or it mayn’t said i it’s the practice where i was before you can bet i know what it’s like and i tell it you for a fact i’m tabooed well said he what have you been doing that’s what i want to find out said i o you can’t be said he it ain’t possible however i’ll tell you what i’ll do just to put your mind at rest i’ll go round and find out for sure just you waltz in and talk to papa thank you i said i’d rather stay right out here on the verandah your house is so close i’ll call papa out here then says he my dear fellow i says i wish you wouldn’t the fact is i don’t take to mr randall case laughed took a lantern from the store and set out into the village he was gone perhaps a quarter of an hour and he looked mighty serious when he came back well said he clapping down the lantern on the verandah steps i would never have believed it i don’t know where the impudence of these kanakas ll go next they seem to have lost all idea of respect for whites what we want is a man of war a german if we could they know how to manage kanakas i _am_ tabooed then i cried something of the sort said he it’s the worst thing of the kind i’ve heard of yet but i’ll stand by you wiltshire man to man you come round here to morrow about nine and we’ll have it out with the chiefs they’re afraid of me or they used to be but their heads are so big by now i don’t know what to think understand me wiltshire i don’t count this your quarrel he went on with a great deal of resolution i count it all of our quarrel i count it the white man’s quarrel and i’ll stand to it through thick and thin and there’s my hand on it have you found out what’s the reason i asked not yet said case but we’ll fix them down to morrow altogether i was pretty well pleased with his attitude and almost more the next day when we met to go before the chiefs to see him so stern and resolved the chiefs awaited us in one of their big oval houses which was marked out to us from a long way off by the crowd about the eaves a hundred strong if there was one men women and children many of the men were on their way to work and wore green wreaths and it put me in thoughts of the 1st of may at home this crowd opened and buzzed about the pair of us as we went in with a sudden angry animation five chiefs were there four mighty stately men the fifth old and puckered they sat on mats in their white kilts and jackets they had fans in their hands like fine ladies and two of the younger ones wore catholic medals which gave me matter of reflection our place was set and the mats laid for us over against these grandees on the near side of the house the midst was empty the crowd close at our backs murmured and craned and jostled to look on and the shadows of them tossed in front of us on the clean pebbles of the floor i was just a hair put out by the excitement of the commons but the quiet civil appearance of the chiefs reassured me all the more when their spokesman began and made a long speech in a low tone of voice sometimes waving his hand towards case sometimes toward me and sometimes knocking with his knuckles on the mat one thing was clear there was no sign of anger in the chiefs what’s he been saying i asked when he had done o just that they’re glad to see you and they understand by me you wish to make some kind of complaint and you’re to fire away and they’ll do the square thing it took a precious long time to say that said i o the rest was sawder and _bonjour_ and that said case you know what kanakas are well they don’t get much _bonjour_ out of me said i you tell them who i am i’m a white man and a british subject and no end of a big chief at home and i’ve come here to do them good and bring them civilisation and no sooner have i got my trade sorted out than they go and taboo me and no one dare come near my place tell them i don’t mean to fly in the face of anything legal and if what they want’s a present i’ll do what’s fair i don’t blame any man looking out for himself tell them for that’s human nature but if they think they’re going to come any of their native ideas over me they’ll find themselves mistaken and tell them plain that i demand the reason of this treatment as a white man and a british subject that was my speech i know how to deal with kanakas give them plain sense and fair dealing and i’ll do them that much justice they knuckle under every time they haven’t any real government or any real law that’s what you’ve got to knock into their heads and even if they had it would be a good joke if it was to apply to a white man it would be a strange thing if we came all this way and couldn’t do what we pleased the mere idea has always put my monkey up and i rapped my speech out pretty big then case translated it or made believe to rather and the first chief replied and then a second and a third all in the same style easy and genteel but solemn underneath once a question was put to case and he answered it and all hands both chiefs and commons laughed out aloud and looked at me last of all the puckered old fellow and the big young chief that spoke first started in to put case through a kind of catechism sometimes i made out that case was trying to fence and they stuck to him like hounds and the sweat ran down his face which was no very pleasant sight to me and at some of his answers the crowd moaned and murmured which was a worse hearing it’s a cruel shame i knew no native for as i now believe they were asking case about my marriage and he must have had a tough job of it to clear his feet but leave case alone he had the brains to run a parliament well is that all i asked when a pause came come along says he mopping his face i’ll tell you outside do you mean they won’t take the taboo off i cried it’s something queer said he i’ll tell you outside better come away i won’t take it at their hands cried i i ain’t that kind of a man you don’t find me turn my back on a parcel of kanakas you’d better said case he looked at me with a signal in his eye and the five chiefs looked at me civilly enough but kind of pointed and the people looked at me and craned and jostled i remembered the folks that watched my house and how the pastor had jumped in his pulpit at the bare sight of me and the whole business seemed so out of the way that i rose and followed case the crowd opened again to let us through but wider than before the children on the skirts running and singing out and as we two white men walked away they all stood and watched us and now said i what is all this about the truth is i can’t rightly make it out myself they have a down on you says case taboo a man because they have a down on him i cried i never heard the like it’s worse than that you see said case you ain’t tabooed i told you that couldn’t be the people won’t go near you wiltshire and there’s where it is they won’t go near me what do you mean by that why won’t they go near me i cried case hesitated seems they’re frightened says he in a low voice i stopped dead short frightened i repeated are you gone crazy case what are they frightened of i wish i could make out case answered shaking his head appears like one of their tomfool superstitions that’s what i don’t cotton to he said it’s like the business about vigours i’d like to know what you mean by that and i’ll trouble you to tell me says i well you know vigours lit out and left all standing said he it was some superstition business i never got the hang of it but it began to look bad before the end i’ve heard a different story about that said i and i had better tell you so i heard he ran away because of you o well i suppose he was ashamed to tell the truth says case i guess he thought it silly and it’s a fact that i packed him off what would you do old man says he get says i and not think twice about it i was the gladdest kind of man to see him clear away it ain’t my notion to turn my back on a mate when he’s in a tight place but there was that much trouble in the village that i couldn’t see where it might likely end i was a fool to be so much about with vigours they cast it up to me to day didn’t you hear maea that’s the young chief the big one ripping out about vika that was him they were after they don’t seem to forget it somehow this is all very well said i but it don’t tell me what’s wrong it don’t tell me what they’re afraid of what their idea is well i wish i knew said case i can’t say fairer than that you might have asked i think says i and so i did says he but you must have seen for yourself unless you’re blind that the asking got the other way i’ll go as far as i dare for another white man but when i find i’m in the scrape myself i think first of my own bacon the loss of me is i’m too good natured and i’ll take the freedom of telling you you show a queer kind of gratitude to a man who’s got into all this mess along of your affairs there’s a thing i am thinking of said i you were a fool to be so much about with vigours one comfort you haven’t been much about with me i notice you’ve never been inside my house own up now you had word of this before it’s a fact i haven’t been said he it was an oversight and i am sorry for it wiltshire but about coming now i’ll be quite plain you mean you won’t i asked awfully sorry old man but that’s the size of it says case in short you’re afraid says i in short i’m afraid says he and i’m still to be tabooed for nothing i asked i tell you you’re not tabooed said he the kanakas won’t go near you that’s all and who’s to make em we traders have a lot of gall i must say we make these poor kanakas take back their laws and take up their taboos and"
