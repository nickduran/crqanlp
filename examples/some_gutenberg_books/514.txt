"1" "to do it so because meg's initials are m.m and i don't want anyone to use these but marmee said beth looking troubled it's all right dear and a very pretty idea quite sensible too for no one can ever mistake now it will please her very much i know said meg with a frown for jo and a smile for beth there's mother hide the basket quick cried jo as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall amy came in hastily and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her where have you been and what are you hiding behind you asked meg surprised to see by her hood and cloak that lazy amy had been out so early don't laugh at me jo i didn't mean anyone should know till the time came i only meant to change the little bottle for a big one and i gave all my money to get it and i'm truly trying not to be selfish any more as she spoke amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that meg hugged her on the spot and jo pronounced her a trump while beth ran to the window and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle you see i felt ashamed of my present after reading and talking about being good this morning so i ran round the corner and changed it the minute i was up and i'm so glad for mine is the handsomest now another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa and the girls to the table eager for breakfast merry christmas marmee many of them thank you for our books we read some and mean to every day they all cried in chorus merry christmas little daughters i'm glad you began at once and hope you will keep on but i want to say one word before we sit down not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing for they have no fire there is nothing to eat over there and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold my girls will you give them your breakfast as a christmas present they were all unusually hungry having waited nearly an hour and for a minute no one spoke only a minute for jo exclaimed impetuously i'm so glad you came before we began may i go and help carry the things to the poor little children asked beth eagerly i shall take the cream and the muffings added amy heroically giving up the article she most liked meg was already covering the buckwheats and piling the bread into one big plate i thought you'd do it said mrs march smiling as if satisfied you shall all go and help me and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast and make it up at dinnertime they were soon ready and the procession set out fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no fire ragged bedclothes a sick mother wailing baby and a group of pale hungry children cuddled under one old quilt trying to keep warm how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in ach mein gott it is good angels come to us said the poor woman crying for joy funny angels in hoods and mittens said jo and set them to laughing in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there hannah who had carried wood made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak mrs march gave the mother tea and gruel and comforted her with promises of help while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birds laughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english das ist gut die engel kinder cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze the girls had never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born that was a very happy breakfast though they didn't get any of it and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning that's loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels not a very splendid show but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles and the tall vase of red roses white chrysanthemums and trailing vines which stood in the middle gave quite an elegant air to the table she's coming strike up beth open the door amy three cheers for marmee cried jo prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor beth played her gayest march amy threw open the door and meg enacted escort with great dignity mrs march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them the slippers went on at once a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket well scented with amy's cologne the rose was fastened in her bosom and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit there was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining in the simple loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time so sweet to remember long afterward and then all fell to work the morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities being still too young to go often to the theater and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances the girls put their wits to work and necessity being the mother of invention made whatever they needed very clever were some of their productions pasteboard guitars antique lamps made of old fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels no gentleman were admitted so jo played male parts to her heart's content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend who knew a lady who knew an actor these boots an old foil and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture were jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions the smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts whisking in and out of various costumes and managing the stage besides it was excellent drill for their memories a harmless amusement and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle lonely or spent in less profitable society on christmas night a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy there was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain a trifle of lamp smoke and an occasional giggle from amy who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment presently a bell sounded the curtains flew apart and the _operatic tragedy_ began a gloomy wood according to the one playbill was represented by a few shrubs in pots green baize on the floor and a cave in the distance this cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof bureaus for walls and in it was a small furnace in full blast with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it the stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside then hugo the villain stalked in with a clanking sword at his side a slouching hat black beard mysterious cloak and the boots after pacing to and fro in much agitation he struck his forehead and burst out in a wild strain singing of his hatred for roderigo his love for zara and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other the gruff tones of hugo's voice with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him were very impressive and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding what ho minion i need thee out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face a red and black robe a staff and cabalistic signs upon her cloak hugo demanded a potion to make zara adore him and one to destroy roderigo hagar in a fine dramatic melody promised both and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter hither hither from thy home airy sprite i bid thee come born of roses fed on dew charms and potions canst thou brew bring me here with elfin speed the fragrant philter which i need make it sweet and swift and strong spirit answer now my song a soft strain of music sounded and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white with glittering wings golden hair and a garland of roses on its head waving a wand it sang hither i come from my airy home afar in the silver moon take the magic spell and use it well or its power will vanish soon and dropping a small gilded bottle at the witch's feet the spirit vanished another chant from hagar produced another apparition not a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she had cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up no one murmured at the delay it was truly superb a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly then came the grand effect of the play roderigo produced a rope ladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on roderigo's shoulder and was about to leap gracefully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her train it caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside don't laugh act as if it was all right and ordering roderigo up banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir this dauntless example fired zara she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the villain's death he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro he wishes her to go into a convent but she won't hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand don pedro refuses because he is not rich they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared the latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he doesn't make them happy the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter this entirely softens the stern sire he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don pedro's blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cot bed on which the dress circle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs march's compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty there was ice cream actually two dishes of it pink and white and cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hot house flowers it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely is it fairies asked amy santa claus said beth mother did it and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration all wrong old mr laurence sent it replied mrs march the laurence boy's grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we don't know him exclaimed meg hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the bread and milk breakfast that boy put it into his head i know he did he's a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted he looks as if he'd like to know us but he's bashful and meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction you mean the people who live in the big house next door don't you asked one of the girls my mother knows old mr laurence but says he's very proud and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors he keeps his grandson shut up when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited him to our party but he didn't come mother says he's very nice though he never speaks to us girls our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitally all about cricket and so on when he saw meg coming and walked off i mean to know him some day for he needs fun i'm sure he does said jo decidedly i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so i've no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own it's a mercy you didn't mother laughed jo looking at her boots but we'll have another play sometime that he can see perhaps he'll help act wouldn't that be jolly i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest they are lovely but beth's roses are sweeter to me said mrs march smelling the half dead posy in her belt beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father i'm afraid he isn't having such a merry christmas as we are chapter three the laurence boy jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old three legged sofa by the sunny window this was jo's favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn't mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new year's eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear what's the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we haven't got anything else answered jo with her mouth full if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when i'm eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait i'm sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i can't take any out you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they aren't as nice as i'd like mine are spoiled with lemonade and i can't get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress you must have gloves or i won't go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you can't dance without them and if you don't i should be so mortified then i'll stay still i don't care much for company dancing it's no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers you can't ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn't get you any more this winter can't you make them do i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are that's all i can do no i'll tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one don't you see your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her then i'll go without i don't care what people say cried jo taking up her book you may have it you may only don't stain it and do behave nicely don't put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you don't worry about me i'll be as prim as i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble on new year's eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the all important business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed it's the dampness drying replied jo what a queer smell it's like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air there now i'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim oh oh oh what have you done i'm spoiled i can't go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead just my luck you shouldn't have asked me to do it i always spoil everything i'm so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so i've made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret it isn't spoiled just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion i've seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly serves me right for trying to be fine i wish i'd let my hair alone cried meg petulantly so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family jo's hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suits meg's in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine meg's high heeled slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk don't eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush no winking isn't ladylike i'll lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and don't shake hands if you are introduced to anyone it isn't the thing how do you learn all the proper ways i never can isn't that music gay down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who didn't care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same"
