"1" "done what do you mean our engagement it's announced i wrote stacks of notes to day and even now there are some left for to morrow and then there's the newspapers bertram right away now _everybody_ will know it her voice was tragic bertram relaxed visibly a tender light came to his eyes well didn't you expect everybody would know it my dear y yes but at her hesitation the tender light changed to a quick fear billy you aren't sorry the pink glory that suffused her face answered him before her words did sorry oh never bertram it's only that it won't be ours any longer that is it won't belong to just our two selves everybody will know it and they'll bow and smile and say how lovely to our faces and did you ever to our backs oh no i'm not sorry bertram but i am afraid _afraid_ billy yes billy sighed and gazed with pensive eyes into the fire across bertram's face swept surprise consternation and dismay bertram had thought he knew billy in all her moods and fancies but he did not know her in this one why billy he breathed billy drew another sigh it seemed to come from the very bottoms of her small satin slippered feet well i am you're _the_ bertram henshaw you know lots and lots of people that i never even saw and they'll come and stand around and stare and lift their lorgnettes and say is that the one dear me bertram gave a relieved laugh nonsense sweetheart i should think you were a picture i'd painted and hung on a wall i shall feel as if i were with all those friends of yours bertram what if they don't like it her voice had grown tragic again _like_ it yes the picture me i mean they can't help liking it he retorted with the prompt certainty of an adoring lover billy shook her head her eyes had gone back to the fire oh yes they can i can hear them what _she_ bertram henshaw's wife a frivolous inconsequential billy like that bertram billy turned fiercely despairing eyes on her lover bertram sometimes i wish my name were clarissa cordelia or arabella maud or hannah jane anything that's feminine and proper bertram's ringing laugh brought a faint smile to billy's lips but the words that followed the laugh and the caressing touch of the man's hands sent a flood of shy color to her face hannah jane indeed as if i'd exchange my billy for her or any clarissa or arabella that ever grew i adore billy flame nature and and naughtiness put in billy herself yes if there be any laughed bertram fondly but see he added taking a tiny box from his pocket see what i've brought for this same billy to wear she'd have had it long ago if she hadn't insisted on waiting for this announcement business oh bertram what a beauty dimpled billy as the flawless diamond in bertram's fingers caught the light and sent it back in a flash of flame and crimson now you are mine really mine sweetheart the man's voice and hand shook as he slipped the ring on billy's outstretched finger billy caught her breath with almost a sob and i'm so glad to be yours dear she murmured brokenly and and i'll make you proud that i am yours even if i am just billy she choked oh i know i'll write such beautiful beautiful songs now the man drew her into a close embrace as if i cared for that he scoffed lovingly billy looked up in quick horror why bertram you don't mean you don't care he laughed lightly and took the dismayed little face between his two hands care darling of course i care you know how i love your music i care about everything that concerns you i meant that i'm proud of you _now_ just you i love _you_ you know there was a moment's pause billy's eyes as they looked at him carried a curious intentness in their dark depths you mean you like the turn of my head and the tilt of my chin she asked a little breathlessly i adore them came the prompt answer to bertram's utter amazement billy drew back with a sharp cry no no not that why _billy billy laughed unexpectedly then she sighed oh it's all right of course she assured him hastily it's only billy stopped and blushed billy was thinking of what hugh calderwell had once said to her that bertram henshaw would never love any girl seriously that it would always be the turn of her head or the tilt of her chin that he loved to paint well only what demanded bertram billy blushed the more deeply but she gave a light laugh nothing only something hugh calderwell said to me once you see bertram i don't think hugh ever thought you would marry oh didn't he bridled bertram well that only goes to show how much he knows about it er did you announce it to him bertram's voice was almost savage now billy smiled no but i did to his sister and she'll tell him oh bertram such a time as i had over those notes went on billy with a chuckle her eyes were dancing and she was seeming more like her usual self bertram thought you see there were such a lot of things i wanted to say about what a dear you were and how much i i liked you and that you had such lovely eyes and a nose billy this time it was bertram who was sitting erect in pale horror billy threw him a roguish glance goosey you are as bad as aunt hannah i said that was what i _wanted_ to say what i really said was quite another matter she finished with a saucy uptilting of her chin bertram relaxed with a laugh you witch his admiring eyes still lingered on her face billy i'm going to paint you sometime in just that pose you're adorable pooh just another face of a girl teased the adorable one bertram gave a sudden exclamation there and i haven't told you yet guess what my next commission is to paint a portrait yes can't who is it j g winthrop's daughter not _the_ j g winthrop the same oh bertram how splendid isn't it and then the girl herself have you seen her but you haven't i know unless you met her abroad she hasn't been in boston for years until now no i haven't seen her is she so _very_ beautiful billy spoke a little soberly yes and no the artist lifted his head alertly what billy called his painting look came to his face it isn't that her features are so regular though her mouth and chin are perfect but her face has so much character and there's an elusive something about her eyes jove if i can only catch it it'll be the best thing yet that i've ever done billy will it i'm so glad and you'll get it i know you will claimed billy clearing her throat a little nervously i wish i felt so sure sighed bertram but it'll be a great thing if i do get it j g winthrop's daughter you know besides the merit of the likeness itself yes yes indeed billy cleared her throat again you've seen her of course lately oh yes i was there half the morning discussing the details sittings and costume and deciding on the pose did you find one to suit find one the artist made a despairing gesture i found a dozen that i wanted the trouble was to tell which i wanted the most billy gave a nervous little laugh isn't that unusual she asked bertram lifted his eyebrows with a quizzical smile well they aren't all marguerite winthrops he reminded her marguerite cried billy oh is her name marguerite i do think marguerite is the dearest name billy's eyes and voice were wistful i don't not the _dearest_ oh it's all well enough of course but it can't be compared for a moment to well say billy billy smiled but she shook her head i'm afraid you're not a good judge of names she objected yes i am though for that matter i should love your name no matter what it was even if twas mary jane eh bantered billy well you'll have a chance to find out how you like that name pretty quick sir we're going to have one here you're going to have a mary jane here do you mean that rosa's going away mercy i hope not shuddered billy you don't find a rosa in every kitchen and never in employment agencies my mary jane is a niece of aunt hannah's or rather a cousin she's coming to boston to study music and i've invited her here we've asked her for a month though i presume we shall keep her right along bertram frowned well of course that's very nice for _mary jane_ he sighed with meaning emphasis billy laughed don't worry dear she won't bother us any oh yes she will sighed bertram she'll be round lots you see if she isn't billy i think sometimes you're almost too kind to other folks never laughed billy besides what would you have me do when a lonesome young girl was coming to boston anyhow _you're_ not the one to talk young man i've known _you_ to take in a lonesome girl and give her a home she flashed merrily bertram chuckled jove what a time that was he exclaimed regarding his companion with fond eyes and spunk too is she going to bring a spunk not that i've heard smiled billy but she _is_ going to wear a pink not really billy of course she is i told her to how do you suppose we could know her when we saw her if she didn't demanded the girl indignantly and what is more sir there will be _two_ pinks worn this time _i_ sha'n't do as uncle william did and leave off my pink only think what long minutes that seemed hours of misery i spent waiting there in that train shed just because i didn't know which man was my uncle william bertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders well your mary jane won't probably turn out to be quite such a bombshell as our billy did unless she should prove to be a boy he added whimsically oh but billy she _can't_ turn out to be such a dear treasure finished the man and at the adoring look in his eyes billy blushed deeply and promptly forgot all about mary jane and her pink chapter iv for mary jane i have a letter here from mary jane my dear announced aunt hannah at the luncheon table one day have you billy raised interested eyes from her own letters what does she say she will be here thursday her train is due at the south station at four thirty she seems to be very grateful to you for your offer to let her come right here for a month but she says she's afraid you don't realize perhaps just what you are doing to take her in like that with her singing and all nonsense she doesn't refuse does she oh no she doesn't refuse but she doesn't accept either exactly as i can see i've read the letter over twice too i'll let you judge for yourself by and by when you have time to read it billy laughed never mind i don't want to read it she's just a little shy about coming that's all she'll stay all right when we come to meet her what time did you say it was thursday half past four south station thursday at half past four let me see that's the day of the carletons at home isn't it oh my grief and conscience yes but i had forgotten it what shall we do oh that will be easy we'll just go to the carletons early and have john wait then take us from there to the south station meanwhile we'll make sure that the little blue room is all ready for her i put in my white enamel work basket yesterday and that pretty little blue case for hairpins and curling tongs that i bought at the fair i want the room to look homey to her you know as if it could look any other way if _you_ had anything to do with it sighed aunt hannah admiringly billy laughed if we get stranded we might ask the henshaw boys to help us out aunt hannah they'd probably suggest guns and swords that's the way they fixed up _my_ room aunt hannah raised shocked hands of protest as if we would mercy what a time that was billy laughed again i never shall forget _never_ my first glimpse of that room when mrs hartwell switched on the lights oh aunt hannah i wish you could have seen it before they took out those guns and spiders as if i didn't see quite enough when i saw william's face that morning he came for me retorted aunt hannah spiritedly dear uncle william what an old saint he has been all the way through mused billy aloud and cyril who would ever have believed that the day would come when cyril would say to me as he did last night that he felt as if marie had been gone a month it's been just seven days you know i know she comes to morrow doesn't she yes and i'm glad i shall tell marie she needn't leave cyril on _my_ hands again bertram says that at home cyril hasn't played a dirge since his engagement but i notice that up here where marie might be but isn't his tunes would never be mistaken for ragtime by the way she added as she rose from the table that's another surprise in store for hugh calderwell he always declared that cyril wasn't a marrying man either any more than bertram you know he said bertram only cared for girls to paint but she stopped and looked inquiringly at rosa who had appeared at that moment in the hall doorway it's the telephone miss neilson mr bertram henshaw wants you a few minutes later aunt hannah heard billy at the piano for fifteen twenty thirty minutes the brilliant scales and arpeggios rippled through the rooms and up the stairs to aunt hannah who knew by the very sound of them that some unusual nervousness was being worked off at the finger tips that played them at the end of forty five minutes aunt hannah went down stairs billy my dear excuse me but have you forgotten what time it is weren't you going out with bertram billy stopped playing at once but she did not turn her head her fingers busied themselves with some music on the piano we aren't going aunt hannah she said bertram can't _can't well he didn't want to so of course i said not to he's been painting this morning on a new portrait and she said he might stay to luncheon and keep right on for a while this afternoon if he liked and he did like so he stayed why how how aunt hannah stopped helplessly oh no not at all interposed billy lightly he told me all about it the other night it's going to be a very wonderful portrait and of course i wouldn't want to interfere with his work and again a brilliant scale rippled from billy's fingers after a crashing chord in the bass slowly aunt hannah turned and went up stairs her eyes were troubled not since billy's engagement had she heard billy play like that bertram did not find a pensive billy awaiting him that evening he found a bright eyed flushed cheeked billy who let herself be kissed once but who did not kiss back a blithe elusive billy who played tripping little melodies and sang jolly little songs instead of sitting before the fire and talking a billy who at last turned and asked tranquilly well how did the picture go bertram rose then crossed the room and took billy very gently into his arms sweetheart you were a dear this noon to let me off like that he began in a voice shaken with emotion you don't know perhaps exactly what you did you see i was nearly wild between wanting to be with you and wanting to go on with my work and i was just at that point where one little word from you one hint that you wanted me to come anyway and i should have come but you didn't say it nor hint it like the brave little bit of inspiration that you are you bade me stay and go on with my work the inspiration's head drooped a little lower but this only brought a wealth of soft bronze hair to just where bertram could lay his cheek against it and bertram promptly took advantage of his opportunity and so i stayed billy and i did good work i know i did good work why billy bertram stepped back now and held billy by the shoulders at arms length billy that's going to be the best work i've ever done i can see it coming even now under my fingers billy lifted her head and looked into her lover's face his eyes were glowing his cheeks were flushed his whole countenance was aflame with the soul of the artist who sees his vision taking shape before him and billy looking at him felt suddenly ashamed oh bertram i'm proud proud _proud_ of you she breathed come let's go over to the fire and talk chapter v marie speaks her mind billy with john and peggy met marie hawthorn at the station peggy was short for pegasus and was what billy always called her luxurious seven seated touring car i simply won't call it automobile she had declared when she bought it in the first place it takes too long to say it and in the second place i don't want to add one more to the nineteen different ways to pronounce it that i hear all around me every day now as for calling it my car or my motor car i should expect to see a pullman or one of those huge black trucks before my door if i ordered it by either of those names neither will i insult the beautiful thing by calling it a machine its name is pegasus i shall call it peggy and peggy she called it john sniffed his disdain and billy's friends made no secret of their amused tolerance but in an astonishingly short time half the automobile owners of her acquaintance were calling their own cars peggy and even the dignified john himself was heard to order some gasoline for peggy quite as a matter of course when marie hawthorn stepped from the train at the north station she greeted billy with affectionate warmth though at once her blue eyes swept the space beyond expectantly and eagerly billy's lips curved in a mischievous smile no he didn't come she said he didn't want to a little bit marie grew actually pale didn't _want_ to she stammered billy gave her a spasmodic hug goosey no he didn't a _little_ bit but he did a great _big_ bit as if you didn't know he was dying to come marie but he simply couldn't something about his concert monday night he told me over the telephone but between his joy that you were coming and his rage that he couldn't see you the first minute you did come i couldn't quite make out what was the trouble but he's coming to dinner to night so he'll doubtless tell you all about it marie sighed her relief oh that's all right then i was afraid he was sick when i didn't see him billy laughed softly no he isn't sick marie but you needn't go away again before the wedding not to leave him on my hands i wouldn't have believed cyril henshaw confirmed old bachelor and avowed woman hater could have acted the part of a love sick boy as he has the last week or two the rose flush on marie's cheek spread to the roots of her fine yellow hair billy dear he he didn't marie dear he he did marie laughed she did not say anything but the rose flush deepened as she occupied herself very busily in getting her trunk check from the little hand bag she carried cyril was not mentioned again until the two girls veils tied and coats buttoned were snugly ensconced in the tonneau and peggy's nose was turned toward home then billy asked have you settled on where you're going to live not quite we're going to talk of that to night but we _do_ know that we aren't going to live at the strata marie marie stirred uneasily at the obvious disappointment and reproach in her friend's voice but dear it wouldn't be wise i'm sure she argued hastily there will be you and bertram we sha'n't be there for a year nearly cut in billy with swift promptness besides i think it would be lovely all together marie smiled but she shook her head lovely but not practical dear billy laughed ruefully i know you're worrying about those puddings of yours you're afraid somebody is going to interfere with your making quite so many as you want to and cyril is worrying for fear there'll be somebody else in the circle of his shaded lamp besides his little marie with the light on her hair and the mending basket by her side billy what are you talking about billy threw a roguish glance into her friend's amazed blue eyes oh just a little picture cyril drew once for me of what home meant for him a room with a table and a shaded lamp and a little woman beside it with the light on her hair and a great basket of sewing by her side marie's eyes softened did he say that yes oh he declared he shouldn't want her to sit under that lamp all the time of course but he hoped she'd like that sort of thing marie threw a quick glance at the stolid back of john beyond the two empty seats in front of them although she knew he could not hear her words instinctively she lowered her voice did you know then about me she asked with heightened color no only that there was a girl somewhere who he hoped would sit under the lamp some day and when i asked him if the girl did like that sort of thing he said yes he thought so for she had told him once that the things she liked best of all to do were to mend stockings and make puddings then i knew of course twas you for i'd heard you say the same thing so i sent him right along out to you in the summer house the pink flush on marie's face grew to a red one her blue eyes turned again to john's broad back then drifted to the long imposing line of windowed walls and doorways on the right the automobile was passing smoothly along beacon street now with the public garden just behind them on the left after a moment marie turned to billy again i'm so glad he wants just puddings and stockings she began a little breathlessly you see for so long i supposed he _wouldn't_ want anything but a very brilliant talented wife who could play and sing beautifully a wife he'd be proud of like you me nonsense laughed billy cyril never wanted me and i never wanted him only once for a few minutes so to speak when i thought i did in spite of our music we aren't a mite congenial i like people around he doesn't i like to go to plays he doesn't he likes rainy days and i abhor them mercy life with me for him would be one long jangling discord my love while with you it'll be one long sweet song marie drew a deep breath her eyes were fixed on a point far ahead up the curveless street i hope it will indeed she breathed not until they were almost home did billy say suddenly oh did cyril write you a young relative of aunt hannah's is coming to morrow to stay a while at the house er yes cyril told me admitted marie billy smiled didn't like it i suppose eh she queried shrewdly n no i'm afraid he didn't very well he said she'd be one more to be around there what did i tell you dimpled billy you can see what you're coming to when you do get that shaded lamp and the mending basket a moment later coming in sight of the house billy saw a tall smooth shaven man standing on the porch the man lifted his hat and waved it gayly baring a slightly bald head to the sun it's uncle william bless his heart cried billy they're all coming to dinner then he and aunt hannah and bertram and i are going down to the hollis street theatre and let you and cyril have a taste of what that shaded lamp is going to be i hope you won't be lonesome she finished mischievously as the car drew up before the door chapter vi at the sign of the pink after a week of beautiful autumn weather thursday dawned raw and cold by noon an east wind had made the temperature still more uncomfortable at two o'clock aunt hannah tapped at billy's chamber door she showed a troubled face to the girl who answered her knock billy _would_ you mind very much if i asked you to go alone to the carletons and to meet mary jane she inquired anxiously why no that is of course i should _mind_ dear because i always like to have you go to places with me but it isn't necessary you aren't sick are you n no not exactly but i have been sneezing all the morning and taking camphor and sugar to break it up if it is a cold but it is so raw and novemberish out that why of course you sha'n't go you poor dear mercy don't get one of those dreadful colds on to you before the wedding have you felt a draft where's another shawl billy turned and cast searching eyes about the room billy always kept shawls everywhere for aunt hannah's shoulders and feet bertram had been known to say indeed that a room according to aunt hannah was not fully furnished unless it contained from one to four shawls assorted as to size and warmth shawls certainly did seem to be a necessity with aunt hannah as she usually wore from one to three at the same time which again caused bertram to declare that he always counted aunt hannah's shawls when he wished to know what the thermometer was no i'm not cold and i haven't felt a draft said aunt hannah now i put on my thickest gray shawl this morning with the little pink one for down stairs and the blue one for breakfast so you see i've been very careful but i _have_ sneezed six times so i think twould be safer not to go out in this east wind you were going to stop for mrs granger anyway weren't you so you'll have her with you for the tea yes dear don't worry i'll take your cards and explain to mrs carleton and her daughters and of course as far as mary jane is concerned i don't know her any more than you do so i couldn't be any help there sighed aunt hannah not a bit smiled billy cheerily don't give it another thought my dear i sha'n't have a bit of trouble all i'll have to do is to look for a girl alone with a pink of course i'll have mine on too and she'll be watching for me so just run along and take your nap dear and be all rested and ready to welcome her when she comes finished billy stooping to give the soft faintly pink cheek a warm kiss well thank you my dear perhaps i will sighed aunt hannah drawing the gray shawl about her as she turned away contentedly mrs carleton's tea that afternoon was for billy not an occasion of unalloyed joy it was the first time she had appeared at a gathering of any size since the announcement of her engagement and as she dolefully told bertram afterwards she had very much the feeling of the picture hung on the wall and they _did_ put up their lorgnettes and say is _that_ the one she declared and i know some of them finished with did you ever too she sighed but billy did not stay long in mrs carleton's softly lighted flower perfumed rooms at ten minutes past four she was saying good by to a group of friends who were vainly urging her to remain longer i can't i really can't she declared i'm due at the south station at half past four to meet a miss arkwright a young cousin of aunt hannah's whom i've never seen before we're to meet at the sign of the pink she explained smilingly just touching the single flower she wore"
