"1" "had been sedulously cared for what lovely hair it has just the wave that yours lacks mother yes was the regretful reply i've never be'n able to git that wave out but her hair's be'n took good care of an there ain't nary gal in town that's got any finer don't worry about the wave mother it's just the fashionable ripple and becomes her immensely i think my little albert favors his aunt rena somewhat your little albert they cried you've got a child oh yes he replied calmly a very fine baby boy they began to purr in proud contentment at this information and made minute inquiries about the age and weight and eyes and nose and other important details of this precious infant they inquired more coldly about the child's mother of whom they spoke with greater warmth when they learned that she was dead they hung breathless on warwick's words as he related briefly the story of his life since he had left years before the house behind the cedars how with a stout heart and an abounding hope he had gone out into a seemingly hostile world and made fortune stand and deliver his story had for the women the charm of an escape from captivity with all the thrill of a pirate's tale with the whole world before him he had remained in the south the land of his fathers where he conceived he had an inalienable birthright by some good chance he had escaped military service in the confederate army and in default of older and more experienced men had undertaken during the rebellion the management of a large estate which had been left in the hands of women and slaves he had filled the place so acceptably and employed his leisure to such advantage that at the close of the war he found himself he was modest enough to think too in default of a better man the husband of the orphan daughter of the gentleman who had owned the plantation and who had lost his life upon the battlefield warwick's wife was of good family and in a more settled condition of society it would not have been easy for a young man of no visible antecedents to win her hand a year or two later he had taken the oath of allegiance and had been admitted to the south carolina bar rich in his wife's right he had been able to practice his profession upon a high plane without the worry of sordid cares and with marked success for one of his age i suppose he concluded that i have got along at the bar as elsewhere owing to the lack of better men many of the good lawyers were killed in the war and most of the remainder were disqualified while i had the advantage of being alive and of never having been in arms against the government people had to have lawyers and they gave me their business in preference to the carpet baggers fortune you know favors the available man his mother drank in with parted lips and glistening eyes the story of his adventures and the record of his successes as rena listened the narrow walls that hemmed her in seemed to draw closer and closer as though they must crush her her brother watched her keenly he had been talking not only to inform the women but with a deeper purpose conceived since his morning walk and deepened as he had followed during his narrative the changing expression of rena's face and noted her intense interest in his story her pride in his successes and the occasional wistful look that indexed her self pity so completely an i s'pose you're happy john asked his mother well mother happiness is a relative term and depends i imagine upon how nearly we think we get what we think we want i have had my chance and haven't thrown it away and i suppose i ought to be happy but then i have lost my wife whom i loved very dearly and who loved me just as much and i'm troubled about my child why they demanded is there anything the matter with him no not exactly he's well enough as babies go and has a good enough nurse as nurses go but the nurse is ignorant and not always careful a child needs some woman of its own blood to love it and look after it intelligently mis molly's eyes were filled with tearful yearning she would have given all the world to warm her son's child upon her bosom but she knew this could not be did your wife leave any kin she asked with an effort no near kin she was an only child you'll be gettin married again suggested his mother no he replied i think not warwick was still reading his sister's face and saw the spark of hope that gleamed in her expressive eye if i had some relation of my own that i could take into the house with me he said reflectively the child might be healthier and happier and i should be much more at ease about him the mother looked from son to daughter with a dawning apprehension and a sudden pallor when she saw the yearning in rena's eyes she threw herself at her son's feet oh john she cried despairingly don't take her away from me don't take her john darlin for it'd break my heart to lose her rena's arms were round her mother's neck and rena's voice was sounding in her ears there there mamma never mind i won't leave you mamma dear old mamma your rena'll stay with you always and never never leave you john smoothed his mother's hair with a comforting touch patted her withered cheek soothingly lifted her tenderly to her place by his side and put his arm about her you love your children mother they're all i've got she sobbed an they cos me all i had when the las one's gone i'll want to go too for i'll be all alone in the world don't take rena john for if you do i'll never see her again an i can't bear to think of it how would you like to lose yo'r one child well well mother we'll say no more about it and now tell me all about yourself and about the neighbors and how you got through the war and who's dead and who's married and everything the change of subject restored in some degree mis molly's equanimity and with returning calmness came a sense of other responsibilities good gracious rena she exclaimed john s be'n in the house an hour and ain't had nothin to eat yet go in the kitchen an spread a clean tablecloth an git out that tater pone an a pitcher o that las kag o persimmon beer an let john take a bite an a sip warwick smiled at the mention of these homely dainties i thought of your sweet potato pone at the hotel to day when i was at dinner and wondered if you'd have some in the house there was never any like yours and i've forgotten the taste of persimmon beer entirely rena left the room to carry out her hospitable commission warwick taking advantage of her absence returned after a while to the former subject of course mother he said calmly i wouldn't think of taking rena away against your wishes a mother's claim upon her child is a high and holy one of course she will have no chance here where our story is known the war has wrought great changes has put the bottom rail on top and all that but it hasn't wiped that out nothing but death can remove that stain if it does not follow us even beyond the grave here she must forever be nobody with me she might have got out into the world with her beauty she might have made a good marriage and if i mistake not she has sense as well as beauty yes sighed the mother she's got good sense she ain't as quick as you was an don't read as many books but she's keerful an painstakin an always tries to do what's right she's be'n thinkin about goin away somewhere an tryin to git a school to teach er somethin sence the yankees have started em everywhere for po white folks an niggers too but i don't like fer her to go too fur with such beauty and brains continued warwick she could leave this town and make a place for herself the place is already made she has only to step into my carriage after perhaps a little preparation and ride up the hill which i have had to climb so painfully it would be a great pleasure to me to see her at the top but of course it is impossible a mere idle dream your claim comes first her duty chains her here it would be so lonely without her murmured the mother weakly an i love her so my las one no doubt no doubt returned warwick with a sympathetic sigh of course you love her it's not to be thought of for a moment it's a pity that she couldn't have a chance here but how could she i had thought she might marry a gentleman but i dare say she'll do as well as the rest of her friends as well as mary b for instance who married homer pettifoot did you say or maybe billy oxendine might do for her as long as she has never known any better she'll probably be as well satisfied as though she married a rich man and lived in a fine house and kept a carriage and servants and moved with the best in the land the tortured mother could endure no more the one thing she desired above all others was her daughter's happiness her own life had not been governed by the highest standards but about her love for her beautiful daughter there was no taint of selfishness the life her son had described had been to her always the ideal but unattainable life circumstances some beyond her control and others for which she was herself in a measure responsible had put it forever and inconceivably beyond her reach it had been conquered by her son it beckoned to her daughter the comparison of this free and noble life with the sordid existence of those around her broke down the last barrier of opposition o lord she moaned what shall i do with out her it'll be lonely john so lonely you'll have your home mother said warwick tenderly accepting the implied surrender you'll have your friends and relatives and the knowledge that your children are happy i'll let you hear from us often and no doubt you can see rena now and then but you must let her go mother it would be a sin against her to refuse she may go replied the mother brokenly i'll not stand in her way i've got sins enough to answer for already warwick watched her pityingly he had stirred her feelings to unwonted depths and his sympathy went out to her if she had sinned she had been more sinned against than sinning and it was not his part to judge her he had yielded to a sentimental weakness in deciding upon this trip to patesville a matter of business had brought him within a day's journey of the town and an over mastering impulse had compelled him to seek the mother who had given him birth and the old town where he had spent the earlier years of his life no one would have acknowledged sooner than he the folly of this visit men who have elected to govern their lives by principles of abstract right and reason which happen perhaps to be at variance with what society considers equally right and reasonable should for fear of complications be careful about descending from the lofty heights of logic to the common level of impulse and affection many years before warwick when a lad of eighteen had shaken the dust of the town from his feet and with it he fondly thought the blight of his inheritance and had achieved elsewhere a worthy career but during all these years of absence he had cherished a tender feeling for his mother and now again found himself in her house amid the familiar surroundings of his childhood his visit had brought joy to his mother's heart and was now to bring its shrouded companion sorrow his mother had lived her life for good or ill a wider door was open to his sister her mother must not bar the entrance she may go the mother repeated sadly drying her tears i'll give her up for her good the table s ready mamma said rena coming to the door the lunch was spread in the kitchen a large unplastered room at the rear with a wide fireplace at one end only yesterday it seemed to warwick he had sprawled upon the hearth turning sweet potatoes before the fire or roasting groundpeas in the ashes or more often reading by the light of a blazing pine knot or lump of resin some volume from the bookcase in the hall from bulwer's novel he had read the story of warwick the kingmaker and upon leaving home had chosen it for his own he was a new man but he had the blood of an old race and he would select for his own one of its worthy names overhead loomed the same smoky beams decorated with what might have been from all appearances the same bunches of dried herbs the same strings of onions and red peppers over in the same corner stood the same spinning wheel and through the open door of an adjoining room he saw the old loom where in childhood he had more than once thrown the shuttle the kitchen was different from the stately dining room of the old colonial mansion where he now lived but it was homelike and it was familiar the sight of it moved his heart and he felt for the moment a sort of a blind anger against the fate which made it necessary that he should visit the home of his childhood if at all like a thief in the night but he realized after a moment that the thought was pure sentiment and that one who had gained so much ought not to complain if he must give up a little he who would climb the heights of life must leave even the pleasantest valleys behind rena asked her mother how'd you like to go an pay yo'r brother john a visit i guess i might spare you for a little while the girl's eyes lighted up she would not have gone if her mother had wished her to stay but she would always have regarded this as the lost opportunity of her life are you sure you don't care mamma she asked hoping and yet doubting oh i'll manage to git along somehow or other you can go an stay till you git homesick an then john'll let you come back home but mis molly believed that she would never come back except like her brother under cover of the night she must lose her daughter as well as her son and this should be the penance for her sin that her children must expiate as well the sins of their fathers who had sinned so lightly after the manner of men neither she nor they could foresee since they could not read the future the next boat by which warwick could take his sister away left early in the morning of the next day but one he went back to his hotel with the understanding that the morrow should be devoted to getting rena ready for her departure and that warwick would visit the household again the following evening for as has been intimated there were several reasons why there should be no open relations between the fine gentleman at the hotel and the women in the house behind the cedars who while superior in blood and breeding to the people of the neighborhood in which they lived were yet under the shadow of some cloud which clearly shut them out from the better society of the town almost any resident could have given one or more of these reasons of which any one would have been sufficient to most of them and to some of them warwick's mere presence in the town would have seemed a bold and daring thing iii the old judge on the morning following the visit to his mother warwick visited the old judge's office the judge was not in but the door stood open and warwick entered to await his return there had been fewer changes in the office where he had spent many many hours than in the town itself the dust was a little thicker the papers in the pigeon holes of the walnut desk were a little yellower the cobwebs in the corners a little more aggressive the flies droned as drowsily and the murmur of the brook below was just as audible warwick stood at the rear window and looked out over a familiar view directly across the creek on the low ground beyond might be seen the dilapidated stone foundation of the house where once had lived flora macdonald the jacobite refugee the most romantic character of north carolina history old judge straight had had a tree cut away from the creek side opposite his window so that this historic ruin might be visible from his office for the judge could trace the ties of blood that connected him collaterally with this famous personage his pamphlet on flora macdonald printed for private circulation was highly prized by those of his friends who were fortunate enough to obtain a copy to the left of the window a placid mill pond spread its wide expanse and to the right the creek disappeared under a canopy of overhanging trees a footstep sounded in the doorway and warwick turning faced the old judge time had left greater marks upon the lawyer than upon his office his hair was whiter his stoop more pronounced when he spoke to warwick his voice had some of the shrillness of old age and in his hand upon which the veins stood out prominently a decided tremor was perceptible good morning judge straight said the young man removing his hat with the graceful southern deference of the young for the old good morning sir replied the judge with equal courtesy you don't remember me i imagine suggested warwick your face seems familiar returned the judge cautiously but i cannot for the moment recall your name i shall be glad to have you refresh my memory i was john walden sir when you knew me the judge's face still gave no answering light of recognition your old office boy continued the younger man ah indeed so you were rejoined the judge warmly extending his hand with great cordiality and inspecting warwick more closely through his spectacles let me see you went away a few years before the war wasn't it yes sir to south carolina yes yes i remember now i had been thinking it was to the north so many things have happened since then that it taxes an old man's memory to keep track of them all well well and how have you been getting along warwick told his story in outline much as he had given it to his mother and sister and the judge seemed very much interested and you married into a good family he asked yes sir and have children one and you are visiting your mother not exactly i have seen her but i am stopping at a hotel h'm are you staying long i leave to morrow it's well enough i wouldn't stay too long the people of a small town are inquisitive about strangers and some of them have long memories i remember we went over the law which was in your favor but custom is stronger than law in these matters custom is law it was a great pity that your father did not make a will well my boy i wish you continued good luck i imagined you would make your way warwick went away and the old judge sat for a moment absorbed in reflection right and wrong he mused must be eternal verities but our standards for measuring them vary with our latitude and our epoch we make our customs lightly once made like our sins they grip us in bands of steel we become the creatures of our creations by one standard my old office boy should never have been born yet he is a son of adam and came into existence in the way ordained by god from the beginning of the world in equity he would seem to be entitled to his chance in life it might have been wiser though for him to seek it farther afield than south carolina it was too near home even though the laws were with him iv down the river neither mother nor daughter slept a great deal during the night of warwick's first visit mis molly anointed her sacrifice with tears and cried herself to sleep rena's emotions were more conflicting she was sorry to leave her mother but glad to go with her brother the mere journey she was about to make was a great event for the two women to contemplate to say nothing of the golden vision that lay beyond for neither of them had ever been out of the town or its vicinity the next day was devoted to preparations for the journey rena's slender wardrobe was made ready and packed in a large valise towards sunset mis molly took off her apron put on her slat bonnet she was ever the pink of neatness picked her way across the street which was muddy from a rain during the day traversed the foot bridge that spanned the ditch in front of the cooper shop and spoke first to the elder of the two men working there good evenin peter good evenin ma'm responded the man briefly and not relaxing at all the energy with which he was trimming a barrel stave mis molly then accosted the younger workman a dark brown young man small in stature but with a well shaped head an expressive forehead and features indicative of kindness intelligence humor and imagination frank she asked can i git you to do somethin fer me soon in the mo'nin yas m i reckon so replied the young man resting his hatchet on the chopping block w'at is it mis molly my daughter s goin away on the boat an i lowed you would n min totin her kyarpet bag down to the w'arf onless you'd ruther haul it down on yo'r kyart it ain't very heavy of co'se i'll pay you fer yo'r trouble thank y ma'm he replied he knew that she would not pay him for the simple reason that he would not accept pay for such a service is she gwine fur he asked with a sorrowful look which he could not entirely disguise as fur as wilmin'ton an beyon she'll be visitin her brother john who lives in another state an wants her to come an see him yas m i'll come i won need de kyart i'll tote de bag bout w'at time shill i come over well long bout seven o'clock or half pas she's goin on the old north state an it leaves at eight frank stood looking after mis molly as she picked her way across the street until he was recalled to his duty by a sharp word from his father ten ter yo wuk boy ten ter yo wuk you re wastin yo time wastin yo time yes he was wasting his time the beautiful young girl across the street could never be anything to him but he had saved her life once and had dreamed that he might render her again some signal service that might win her friendship and convince her of his humble devotion for frank was not proud a smile which peter would have regarded as condescending to a free man who since the war was as good as anybody else a kind word which peter would have considered offensively patronizing a piece of mis molly's famous potato pone from rena's hands a bone to a dog peter called it once were ample rewards for the thousand and one small services frank had rendered the two women who lived in the house behind the cedars frank went over in the morning a little ahead of the appointed time and waited on the back piazza until his services were required you ain't gwine ter be gone long is you miss rena he inquired when rena came out dressed for the journey in her best frock with broad white collar and cuffs rena did not know she had been asking herself the same question all sorts of vague dreams had floated through her mind during the last few hours as to what the future might bring forth but she detected the anxious note in frank's voice and had no wish to give this faithful friend of the family unnecessary pain oh no frank i reckon not i'm supposed to be just going on a short visit my brother has lost his wife and wishes me to come and stay with him awhile and look after his little boy i'm feared you'll lack it better dere miss rena replied frank sorrowfully dropping his mask of unconcern an den you won't come back an none er yo frien's won't never see you no mo you don't think frank asked rena severely that i would leave my mother and my home and all my friends and never come back again why no ndeed interposed mis molly wistfully as she hovered around her daughter giving her hair or her gown a touch here and there she'll be so homesick in a month that she'll be willin to walk home you would n never hafter do dat miss rena returned frank with a disconsolate smile ef you ever wanter come home an can't git back no other way jes let me know an i'll take my mule an my kyart an fetch you back ef it's from de een er de worl thank you frank i believe you would said the girl kindly you're a true friend frank and i'll not forget you while i'm gone the idea of her beautiful daughter riding home from the end of the world with frank in a cart behind a one eyed mule struck mis molly as the height of the ridiculous she was in a state of excitement where tears or laughter would have come with equal ease and she turned away to hide her merriment her daughter was going to live in a fine house and marry a rich man and ride in her carriage of course a negro would drive the carriage but that was different from riding with one in a cart when it was time to go mis molly and rena set out on foot for the river which was only a short distance away frank followed with the valise there was no gathering of friends to see rena off as might have been the case under different circumstances her departure had some of the characteristics of a secret flight it was as important that her destination should not be known as it had been that her brother should conceal his presence in the town mis molly and rena remained on the bank until the steamer announced with a raucous whistle its readiness to depart warwick was seen for a moment on the upper deck from which he greeted them with a smile and a slight nod he had bidden his mother an affectionate farewell the evening before rena gave her hand to frank good by frank she said with a kind smile i hope you and mamma will be good friends while i'm gone the whistle blew a second warning blast and the deck hands prepared to draw in the gang plank rena flew into her mother's arms and then breaking away hurried on board and retired to her state room from which she did not emerge during the journey the window blinds were closed darkening the room and the stewardess who came to ask if she should bring her some dinner could not see her face distinctly but perceived enough to make her surmise that the young lady had been weeping po chile murmured the sympathetic colored woman i reckon some er her folks is dead er her sweetheart s gone back on her er e'se she's had some kin er bad luck er nuther w'ite folks has deir troubles jes ez well ez black folks an sometimes feels em mo cause dey ain't ez use ter em mis molly went back in sadness to the lonely house behind the cedars henceforth to be peopled for her with only the memory of those she had loved she had paid with her heart's blood another installment on the shylock's bond exacted by society for her own happiness of the past and her children's prospects for the future the journey down the sluggish river to the seaboard in the flat bottomed stern wheel steamer lasted all day and most of the night during the first half day the boat grounded now"
