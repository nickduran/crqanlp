"1" "following a protector and forerunner but _driven_ impelled by force and resistless will the same will which once went before without force they are all trimmed as much as possible to one pattern and all make the same sad plaint it is a day on which to thank god for the unknown tongue the drover and his lad in dusty blue coats plod along stolidly deaf and blind to all but the way before them no longer wielding the crook instrument of deliverance or at most of gentle compulsion but armed with a heavy stick and mechanically dealing blows on the short thick fleeces without evil intent because without thought it is the ritual of the trade of all the poor dumb pilgrims of the road the bullocks are the most terrible to see they are not patient but go most unwillingly with lowered head and furtive sideways motion in their eyes a horror of great fear the sleek cattle knee deep in pasture massed at the gate and stared mild eyed and with inquiring bellow at the retreating drove but these passed without answer on to the unknown and for them it spelt death behind a squadron of sleek well fed cart horses formed in fours with straw braid in mane and tail came the ponies for the most part a merry company long strings of rusty shaggy two year olds unbroken unkempt the short down grass still sweet on their tongues full of fun frolic and wickedness biting and pulling casting longing eyes at the hedgerows the boys appear to recognise them as kindred spirits and are curiously forbearing and patient soon both ponies and boys vanish in a white whirl and a long line of carts which had evidently waited for the dust to subside comes slowly up the incline for the most part they carry the pigs and fowls carriage folk of the road the latter are hot crowded and dusty under the open netting the former for the most part cheerfully remonstrative i drew a breath of relief as the noise of wheels died away and my road sank into silence the hedgerows are no longer green but white and choked with dust a sight to move good sister rain to welcome tears the birds seem to have fled before the noisy confusion i wonder whether my snake has seen and smiled at the clumsy ruling of the lord he so little heeds i turned aside through the gate to plunge face and hands into the cool of the sheltered grass that side the hedge and then rested my eyes on the stretch of green i had lacked all day the rabbits had apparently played and browsed unmindful of the stir and were still flirting their white tails along the hedgerows a lark rose another and another and i went back to my road peace still reigned for the shadows were lengthening and there would be little more traffic for the fair i turned to my work grateful for the stillness and saw on the white stretch of road a lone old man and a pig surely i knew that tall figure in the quaint grey smock surely i knew the face furrowed like nature’s face in springtime and crowned by a round soft hat and the pig the black pig walking decorously free ay i knew them in the early spring i took a whole holiday and a long tramp and towards afternoon tired and thirsty sought water at a little lonely cottage whose windows peered and blinked under overhanging brows of thatch i had not the water i asked for but milk and a bowl of sweet porridge for which i paid only thanks and stayed for a chat with my kindly hosts they were a quaint old couple of the kind rarely met with nowadays they enjoyed a little pension from the squire and a garden in which vegetables and flowers lived side by side in friendliest fashion bees worked and sang over the thyme and marjoram blooming early in a sunny nook and in a homely sty lived a solemn black pig a pig with a history it was no common utilitarian pig but the honoured guest of the old couple and it knew it a year before their youngest and only surviving child then a man of five and twenty had brought his mother the result of his savings in the shape of a fine young pig a week later he lay dead of the typhoid that scourged maidstone hence the pig was sacred cared for and loved by this darby and joan ee be mos like a child to me and the mother an mos as sensible as a christian ee be the old man had said and i could hardly credit my eyes when i saw the tall bent figure side by side with the black pig coming along my road on such a day i hailed the old man and both turned aside but he gazed at me without remembrance i spoke of the pig and its history he nodded wearily ay ay lad you’ve got it tis poor dick’s pig right enow but you’re never going to take it to e ay but i be and comin back alone if the lord be marciful the missus has been terrible bad this two mouths and more squire’s in foreign parts and food stuffs such as the old woman wants is hard buying for poor folks the stocking’s empty now tis the pig must go and i believe he’d be glad for to do the missus a turn she were terrible good to him were the missus and fond too i dursn’t tell her he was to go she’d sooner starve than lose poor dick’s pig well we’d best be movin tis a fairish step the pig followed comprehending and docile and as the quaint couple passed from sight i thought i heard brother death stir in the shadow he is a strong angel and of great pity chapter v there is always a little fire of wood on the open hearth in the kitchen when i get home at night the old lady says it is company for her and sits in the lonely twilight her knotted hands lying quiet on her lap her listening eyes fixed on the burning sticks i wonder sometimes whether she hears music in the leap and lick of the fiery tongues music such as he of bayreuth draws from the violins till the hot energy of the fire spirit is on us embodied in sound surely she hears some voice that lonely old woman on whom is set the seal of great silence it is a great truth tenderly said that god builds the nest for the blind bird and may it not be that he opens closed eyes and unstops deaf ears to sights and sounds from which others by these very senses are debarred here the best of us see through a mist of tears men as trees walking it is only in the land which is very far off and yet very near that we shall have fulness of sight and see the king in his beauty and i cannot think that any listening ears listen in vain the coppice at our back is full of birds for it is far from the road and they nest there undisturbed year after year through the still night i heard the nightingales calling calling until i could bear it no longer and went softly out into the luminous dark the little wood was manifold with sound i heard my little brothers who move by night rustling in grass and tree a hedgehog crossed my path with a dull squeak the bats shrilled high to the stars a white owl swept past me crying his hunting note a beetle boomed suddenly in my face and above and through it all the nightingales sang and sang the night wind bent the listening trees and the stars yearned earthward to hear the song of deathless love louder and louder the wonderful notes rose and fell in a passion of melody and then sank to rest on that low thrilling call which it is said death once heard and stayed his hand they will scarcely sing again this year these nightingales for they are late on the wing as it is it seems as if on such nights they sang as the swan sings knowing it to be the last time with the lavish note of one who bids an eternal farewell at last there was silence sitting under the big beech tree the giant of the coppice i rested my tired self in the lap of mother earth breathed of her breath and listened to her voice in the quickening silence until my flesh came again as the flesh of a little child for it is true recreation to sit at the footstool of god wrapped in a fold of his living robe the while night smoothes our tired face with her healing hands the grey dawn awoke and stole with trailing robes across earth’s floor at her footsteps the birds roused from sleep and cried a greeting the sky flushed and paled conscious of coming splendour and overhead a file of swans passed with broad strong flight to the reeded waters of the sequestered pool another hour of silence while the light throbbed and flamed in the east then the larks rose harmonious from a neighbouring field the rabbits scurried with ears alert to their morning meal the day had begun i passed through the coppice and out into the fields beyond the dew lay heavy on leaf and blade and gossamer a cool fresh wind swept clear over dale and down from the sea and the clover field rippled like a silvery lake in the breeze there is something inexpressibly beautiful in the unused day something beautiful in the fact that it is still untouched unsoiled and town and country share alike in this loveliness at half past three on a june morning even london has not assumed her responsibilities but smiles and glows lighthearted and smokeless under the caresses of the morning sun five o’clock the bell rings out crisp and clear from the monastery where the bedesmen of st hugh watch and pray for the souls on this labouring forgetful earth every hour the note of comfort and warning cries across the land tells the sanctus the angelus and the hours of the passion and calls to remembrance and prayer when the wind is north the sound carries as far as my road and companies me through the day and if to his dumb children god in his mercy reckons work as prayer most certainly those who have forged through the ages an unbroken chain of supplication and thanksgiving will be counted among the stalwart labourers of the house of the lord sun and bell together are my only clock it is time for my water drawing and gathering a pile of mushrooms children of the night i hasten home the cottage is dear to me in its quaint untidiness and want of rectitude dear because we are to be its last denizens last of the long line of toilers who have sweated and sown that others might reap and have passed away leaving no trace i once saw a tall cross in a seaboard churchyard inscribed to the memory of the unknown dead who have perished in these waters there might be one in every village sleeping place to the unhonoured many who made fruitful the land with sweat and tears it is a consolation to think that when we look back on this stretch of life’s road from beyond the first milestone which it is instructive to remember is always a grave we may hope to see the work of this world with open eyes and to judge of it with a due sense of proportion a bee with laden honey bag hummed and buzzed in the hedge as i got ready for work importuning the flowers for that which he could not carry and finally giving up the attempt in despair fell asleep on a buttercup the best place for his weary little velvet body in five minutes they may have been five hours to him he awoke a new bee sensible and clear sighted and flew blithely away to the hive with his sufficiency an example this weary world would be wise to follow my road has been lonely to day a parson came by in the afternoon a stranger in the neighbourhood for he asked his way he talked awhile and with kindly rebuke said it was sad to see a man of my education brought so low which shows how the outside appearance may mislead the prejudiced observer was it misfortune nay the best of good luck i answered gaily the good man with beautiful readiness sat down on a heap of stones and bade me say on read me a sermon in stone he said simply and i stayed my hand to read he listened with courteous intelligence you hold a roadmender has a vocation he asked as the monk or the artist for like both he is universal the world is his home he serves all men alike ay and for him the beasts have equal honour with the men his soul is bound up in the bundle of life with all other souls he sees his father his mother his brethren in the children of the road for him there is nothing unclean nothing common the very stones cry out that they serve parson nodded his head it is all true he said beautifully true but need such a view of life necessitate the work of roadmending surely all men should be roadmenders o wise parson so to read the lesson of the road it is true i answered but some of us find our salvation in the actual work and earn our bread better in this than in any other way no man is dependent on our earning all men on our work we are rich beyond the dreams of avarice because we have all that we need and yet we taste the life and poverty of the very poor we are if you will uncloistered monks preaching friars who speak not with the tongue disciples who hear the wise words of a silent master robert louis stevenson was a roadmender said the wise parson ay and with more than his pen i answered i wonder was he ever so truly great so entirely the man we know and love as when he inspired the chiefs to make a highway in the wilderness surely no more fitting monument could exist to his memory than the road of gratitude cut laid and kept by the pure blooded tribe kings of samoa parson nodded he knew that the people who make no roads are ruled out from intelligent participation in the world’s brotherhood he filled his pipe thinking the while then he held out his pouch to me try some of this baccy he said sherwood of magdalen sent it me from some outlandish place i accepted gratefully it was such tobacco as falls to the lot of few roadmenders he rose to go i wish i could come and break stones he said a little wistfully nay said i few men have such weary roadmending as yours and perhaps you need my road less than most men and less than most parsons we shook hands and he went down the road and out of my life he little guessed that i knew sherwood ay and knew him too for had not sherwood told me of the man he delighted to honour ah well i am no browning junior and sherwood’s name is not sherwood chapter vi awhile ago i took a holiday mouched played truant from my road jem the waggoner hailed me as he passed he was going to the mill would i ride with him and come back atop of the full sacks i hid my hammer in the hedge climbed into the great waggon white and fragrant with the clean sweet meal and flung myself down on the empty flour bags the looped back tarpaulin framed the long vista of my road with the downs beyond and i lay in the cool dark caressed by the fresh breeze in its thoroughfare soothed by the strong monotonous tramp of the great grey team and the music of the jangling harness jem walked at the leaders heads it is his rule when the waggon is empty a rule no company will make him break at first i regretted it but soon discovered i learnt to know him better so as he plodded along his thickset figure slightly bent his hands in his pockets his whip under one arm whistling hymn tunes in a low minor while the great horses answered to his voice without touch of lash or guiding rein i lay as in a blissful dream and watched my road unfold the sun set the pine boles aflare where the hedge is sparse and stretched the long shadows of the besom poplars in slanting bars across the white highway the roadside gardens smiled friendly with their trim cut laurels and rows of stately sunflowers a seemly proximity this daphne and clytie sisters in experience wrapped in the warm caress of the god whose wooing they need no longer fear here and there we passed little groups of women and children off to work in the early cornfields and jem paused in his fond repetition of the lord my pasture shall prepare to give them good day it is like life this travelling backwards that which has been alone visible like life which is after all retrospective with a steady moving on into the unknown unseen until faith is lost in sight and experience is no longer the touchstone of humanity the face of the son of adam is set on the road his brothers have travelled marking their landmarks tracing their journeyings but with the eyes of a child of god he looks forward straining to catch a glimpse of the jewelled walls of his future home the city eternal in the heavens presently we left my road for the deep shade of a narrow country way where the great oaks and beeches meet overhead and no hedge clipper sets his hand to stay nature’s profusion and so by pleasant lanes scarce the waggon’s width across now shady now sunny here bordered by thickset coverts there giving on fruitful fields we came at length to the mill i left jem to his business with the miller and wandered down the flowery meadow to listen to the merry clack of the stream and the voice of the waters on the weir the great wheel was at rest as i love best to see it in the later afternoon the splash and churn of the water belong rather to the morning hours it is the chief mistake we make in portioning out our day that we banish rest to the night time which is for sleep and recreating instead of setting apart the later afternoon and quiet twilight hours for the stretching of weary limbs and repose of tired mind after a day’s toil that should begin and end at five the little stone bridge over the mill stream is almost on a level with the clear running water and i lay there and gazed at the huge wheel which under multitudinous forms and uses is one of the world’s wonders because one of the few things we imitative children have not learnt from nature is it perchance a memory out of that past when adam walked clear eyed in paradise and talked with the lord in the cool of the day did he see then the flaming wheels instinct with service wondrous messengers of the most high vouchsafed in vision to the later prophets maybe he did and going forth from before the avenging sword of his own forging to the bitterness of an accursed earth took with him this bright memory of perfect ceaseless service and so fashioned our labouring wheel pathetic link with the time of his innocency it is one of many unanswered questions good to ask because it has no answer only the suggestion of a train of thought perhaps we are never so receptive as when with folded hands we say simply this is a great mystery i watched and wondered until jem called and i had to leave the rippling weir and the water’s side and the wheel with its untold secret the miller’s wife gave me tea and a crust of home made bread and the miller’s little maid sat on my knee while i told the sad tale of a little pink cloud separated from its parents and teazed and hunted by mischievous little airs to morrow if i mistake not her garden will be wet with its tears and let us hope point a moral for the tale had its origin in a frenzied chicken driven from the side of an anxious mother and pursued by a sturdy relentless figure in a white sun bonnet the little maid trotted off greatly sobered to look somewhat prematurely for the cloud’s tears and i climbed to my place at the top of the piled up sacks and thence watched twilight pass to starlight through my narrow peep and so watching slept until jem’s voice hailed me from dreamland and i went only half awake across the dark fields home autumn is here and it is already late he has painted the hedges russet and gold scarlet and black and a tangle of grey now he has damp brown leaves in his hair and frost in his finger tips it is a season of contrasts at first all is stir and bustle the ingathering of man and beast barn and rickyard stand filled with golden treasure at the farm the sound of threshing in wood and copse the squirrels busied twixt tree and storehouse while the ripe nuts fall with thud of thunder rain when the harvesting is over the fruit gathered the last rick thatched there comes a pause earth strips off her bright colours and shows a bare and furrowed face the dead leaves fall gently and sadly through the calm sweet air grey mists drape the fields and hedges the migratory birds have left save a few late swallows and as i sit at work in the soft still rain i can hear the blackbird’s melancholy trill and the thin pipe of the redbreast’s winter song the air is full of the sound of farewell forethought and preparation for the future which shall be farewell because of the future which may never be for us man thou hast goods laid up for many years and it is well but remember this night _thy_ soul may be required is the unvoiced lesson of autumn there is growing up among us a great fear it stares at us white wide eyed from the faces of men and women alike the fear of pain mental and bodily pain for the last twenty years we have waged war with suffering a noble war when fought in the interest of the many but fraught with great danger to each individual man it is the fear which should not be rather than the hope which is in us that leads men in these days to drape death in a flowery mantle to lay stress on the shortness of parting the speedy reunion to postpone their good byes until the last moment or avoid saying them altogether and this fear is a poor ignoble thing unworthy of those who are as gods knowing good and evil we are still paying the price of that knowledge suffering in both kinds is a substantial part of it and brings its own healing let us pay like men our face to the open heaven neither whimpering like children in the dark nor lulled to unnecessary oblivion by some lethal drug for it is manly not morbid to dare to taste the pungent savour of pain the lingering sadness of farewell which emphasises the aftermath of life it should have its place in all our preparation as a part of our inheritance we dare not be without there is an old couple in our village who are past work the married daughter has made shift to take her mother and the parish half crown but there is neither room nor food for the father and he must go to n if husband and wife went together they would be separated at the workhouse door the parting had to come it came yesterday i saw them stumbling lamely down the road on their last journey together walking side by side without touch or speech seeing and heeding nothing but a blank future as they passed me the old man said gruffly tis far eno better be gettin back but the woman shook her head and they breasted the hill together at the top they paused shook hands and separated one went on the other turned back and as the old woman limped blindly by i turned away for there are sights a man dare not look upon she passed and i heard a child’s shrill voice say i come to look for you gran and i thanked god that there need be no utter loneliness in the world while it holds a little child now it is my turn and i must leave the wayside to serve in the sheepfolds during the winter months it is scarcely a farewell for my road is ubiquitous eternal there are green ways in paradise and golden streets in the beautiful city of god nevertheless my heart is heavy for viewed by the light of the waning year roadmending seems a great and wonderful work which i have poorly conceived of and meanly performed yet i have learnt to understand dimly the truths of three great paradoxes the blessing of a curse the voice of silence the companionship of solitude and so take my leave of this stretch of road and of you who have fared along the white highway through the medium of a printed page farewell it is a roadmender’s word i cry you godspeed to the next milestone and beyond out of the shadow chapter i i am no longer a roadmender the stretch of white highway which leads to the end of the world will know me no more the fields and hedgerows grass and leaf stiff with the crisp rime of winter’s breath lie beyond my horizon the ewes in the folding their mysterious eyes quick with the consciousness of coming motherhood answer another’s voice and hand while i lie here not in the lonely companionship of my expectations but where the shadow is bright with kindly faces and gentle hands until one kinder and gentler still carries me down the stairway into the larger room but now the veil was held aside and one went by crowned with the majesty of years wearing the ermine of an unstained rule the purple of her people’s loyalty nations stood with bated breath to see her pass in the starlit mist of her children’s tears a monarch greatest of her time an empress conquered men called mother a woman englishmen cried queen still the crowned captive of her people’s heart the prisoner of love the night goers passed under my window in silence neither song nor shout broke the welcome dark next morning the workmen who went by were strangely quiet victoria dei gratia britanniarum regina did they think of how that legend would disappear and of all it meant as they paid their pennies at the coffee stall the feet rarely know the true value and work of the head but all englishmen have been and will be quick to acknowledge and revere victoria by the grace of god a wise woman a great and loving mother years ago i standing at a level crossing saw her pass the train slowed down and she caught sight of the gatekeeper’s little girl who had climbed the barrier such a smile as she gave her and then i caught a quick startled gesture as she slipped from my vision i thought afterwards it was that she feared the child might fall mother first then queen even so rest came to her not in one of the royal palaces but in her own home surrounded by the immediate circle of her nearest and dearest while the world kept watch and ward i a shy lover of the fields and woods longed always should a painless passing be vouchsafed me to make my bed on the fragrant pine needles in the aloneness of a great forest to lie once again as i had lain many a time bathed in the bitter sweetness of the sun blessed pines lapped in the manifold silence my ear attuned to the wind of heaven with its call from the cities of peace in sterner mood when love’s hand held a scourge i craved rather the stress of the moorland with its bleaker mind imperative of sacrifice to rest again under the lee of rippon tor swept by the strong peat smelling breeze to stare untired at the long cloud shadowed reaches and watch the mist wraiths huddle and shrink round the stones of blood until my sacrifice too was accomplished and my soul had fled a wild waste moor a vast void sky and naught between heaven and earth but man his sin glazed eyes seeking afar the distant light of"
