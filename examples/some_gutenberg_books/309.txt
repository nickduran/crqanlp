"1" "a sigh and a cheer but better be living than dead a joy and a pain a loss and a gain there's honey and may be some gall yet still i declare foul weather or fair it's a mighty good world after all for look lass at night when i break from the fight my kingdom's awaiting for me there's comfort and rest and the warmth of your breast and little ones climbing my knee there's fire light and song oh the world may be wrong its empires may topple and fall my home is my care if gladness be there it's a mighty good world after all o heart of pure gold i have made you a fold it's sheltered sun fondled and warm o little ones rest i have fashioned a nest sleep on you are safe from the storm for there's no foe like fear and there's no friend like cheer and sunshine will flash at our call so crown love as king and let us all sing it's a mighty good world after all the return they turned him loose he bowed his head a felon bent and grey his face was even as the dead he had no word to say he sought the home of his old love to look on her once more and where her roses breathed above he cowered beside the door she sat there in the shining room her hair was silver grey he stared and stared from out the gloom he turned to go away her roses rustled overhead she saw with sudden start i knew that you would come she said and held him to her heart her face was rapt and angel sweet she touched his hair of grey _but he sob shaken at her feet could only pray and pray_ the junior god the junior god looked from his place in the conning towers of heaven and he saw the world through the span of space like a giant golf ball driven and because he was bored as some gods are with high celestial mirth he clutched the reins of a shooting star and he steered it down to earth the junior god mid leaf and bud passed on with a weary air till lo he came to a pool of mud and some hogs were rolling there then in he plunged with gleeful cries and down he lay supine for they had no mud in paradise and they likewise had no swine the junior god forgot himself he squelched mud through his toes with the careless joy of a wanton boy his reckless laughter rose till tired at last in a brook close by he washed off every stain then softly up to the radiant sky he rose a god again the junior god now heads the roll in the list of heaven's peers he sits in the house of high control and he regulates the spheres yet does he wonder do you suppose if even in gods divine the best and wisest may not be those who have wallowed awhile with the swine the nostomaniac _on the ragged edge of the world i'll roam and the home of the wolf shall be my home and a bunch of bones on the boundless snows the end of my trail who knows who knows i'm dreaming to night in the fire glow alone in my study tower my books battalioned around me my kipling flat on my knee but i'm not in the mood for reading i haven't moved for an hour body and brain i'm weary weary the heart of me weary of crushing a longing it's little i understand for i thought that my trail was ended i thought i had earned my rest but oh it's stronger than life is the call of the hearthless land and i turn to the north in my trouble as a child to the mother breast here in my den it's quiet the sea wind taps on the pane there's comfort and ease and plenty the smile of the south is sweet all that a man might long for fight for and seek in vain pictures and books and music pleasure my last retreat peace i thought i had gained it i swore that my tale was told by my hair that is grey i swore it by my eyes that are slow to see yet what does it all avail me to night to night as of old out of the dark i hear it the northland calling to me and i'm daring a rampageous river that runs the devil knows where my hand is athrill on the paddle the birch bark bounds like a bird hark to the rumble of rapids here in my morris chair eager and tense i'm straining isn't it most absurd now in the churn and the lather foam that hisses and stings leap i keyed for the struggle fury and fume and roar rocks are spitting like hell cats oh it's a sport for kings life on a twist of the paddle there's my kim on the floor how i thrill and i vision then my camp of a night red and gold of the fire glow net afloat in the stream scent of the pines and silence little pal pipe alight body a purr with pleasure sleep untroubled of dream banquet of paystreak bacon moment of joy divine when the bannock is hot and gluey and the teapot's nearing the boil never was wolf so hungry stomach cleaving to spine ha there's my servant calling says that dinner will spoil what do i want with dinner can i eat any more can i sleep as i used to oh i abhor this life give me the great uncertain the barren land for a floor the milky way for a roof beam splendour and space and strife something to fight and die for the limpid lake of the bear the empire of empty bellies the dunes where the dogribs dwell big things real things live things here on my morris chair how i ache for the northland dinner and servants hell am i too old i wonder can i take one trip more go to the granite ribbed valleys flooded with sunset wine peaks that pierce the aurora rivers i must explore lakes of a thousand islands millioning hordes of the pine do they not miss me i wonder valley and peak and plain whispering each to the other many a moon has passed where has he gone our lover will he come back again star with his fires our tundra leave us his bones at last yes i'll go back to the northland back to the way of the bear back to the muskeg and mountain back to the ice leaguered sea old am i what does it matter nothing i would not dare give me a trail to conquer oh it is meat to me i will go back to the northland feeble and blind and lame sup with the sunny eyed husky eat moose nose with the cree play with the yellow knife bastards boasting my blood and my name i will go back to the northland for the northland is calling to me then give to me paddle and whiplash and give to me tumpline and gun give to me salt and tobacco flour and a gunny of tea take me up over the circle under the flamboyant sun turn me foot loose like a savage that is the finish of me i know the trail i am seeking it's up by the lake of the bear it's down by the arctic barrens it's over to hudson's bay maybe i'll get there maybe death is set by a hair hark it's the northland calling now must i go away _go to the wild that waits for me go where the moose and the musk ox be go to the wolf and the secret snows go to my fate who knows who knows ambition they brought the mighty chief to town they showed him strange unwonted sights yet as he wandered up and down he seemed to scorn their vain delights his face was grim his eye lacked fire as one who mourns a glory dead and when they sought his heart's desire me like'um tooth same gold he said a dental place they quickly found he neither moaned nor moved his head they pulled his teeth so white and sound they put in teeth of gold instead oh never saw i man so gay his very being seemed to swell ha ha he cried now injun say me heap big chief _me look like hell_ to sunnydale there lies the trail to sunnydale amid the lure of laughter oh how can we unhappy be beneath its leafy rafter each perfect hour is like a flower each day is like a posy how can you say the skies are grey you're wrong my friend they're rosy with right good will let's climb the hill and leave behind all sorrow oh we'll be gay a bright to day will make a bright to morrow oh we'll be strong the way is long that never has a turning the hill is high but there's the sky and how the west is burning and if through chance of circumstance we have to go bare foot sir we'll not repine a friend of mine has got no feet to boot sir this happiness a habit is and life is what we make it see there's the trail to sunnydale up friend and let us take it the blind and the dead she lay like a saint on her copper couch like an angel asleep she lay in the stare of the ghoulish folks that slouch past the dead and sneak away then came old jules of the sightless gaze who begged in the streets for bread each day he had come for a year of days and groped his way to the dead what's the devil's harvest to day he cried a wanton with eyes of blue i've known too many a such he sighed maybe i know this mon dieu he raised the head of the heedless dead he fingered the frozen face then a deathly spell on the watchers fell god it was still that place he raised the head of the careless dead he fumbled a vagrant curl and then with his sightless smile he said it's only my little girl dear my dear did they hurt you so come to your daddy's heart aye and he held so tight you know they were hard to force apart no paris isn't always gay and the morgue has its stories too you are a writer of tales you say then there is a tale for you the atavist what are you doing here tom thorne on the white top knot o the world where the wind has the cut of a naked knife and the stars are rapier keen hugging a smudgy willow fire deep in a lynx robe curled you that's a lord's own son tom thorne what does your madness mean go home go home to your clubs tom thorne home to your evening dress home to your place of power and pride and the feast that waits for you why do you linger all alone in the splendid emptiness scouring the land of the little sticks on the trail of the caribou why did you fall off the earth tom thorne out of our social ken what did your deep damnation prove what was your dark despair oh with the width of a world between and years to the count of ten if they cut out your heart to night tom thorne _her_ name would be graven there and you fled afar for the thing called peace and you thought you would find it here in the purple tundras vastly spread and the mountains whitely piled it's a weary quest and a dreary quest but i think that the end is near for they say that the lord has hidden it in the secret heart of the wild and you know that heart as few men know and your eyes are fey and deep with a something lost come welling back from the raw red dawn of life with woe and pain have you greatly lain till out of abysmal sleep the soul of the stone age leaps in you alert for the ancient strife and if you came to our feast again with its pomp and glee and glow i think you would sit stone still tom thorne and see in a daze of dream a mad sun goading to frenzied flame the glittering gems of the snow and a monster musk ox bulking black against the blood red gleam i think you would see berg battling shores and stammer and halt and stare with a sudden sense of the frozen void serene and vast and still and the aching gleam and the hush of dream and the track of a great white bear and the primal lust that surged in you as you sprang to make your kill i think you would hear the bull moose call and the glutted river roar and spy the hosts of the caribou shadow the shining plain and feel the pulse of the silences and stand elate once more on the verge of the yawning vastitudes that call to you in vain for i think you are one with the stars and the sun and the wind and the wave and the dew and the peaks untrod that yearn to god and the valleys undefiled men soar with wings and they bridle kings but what is it all to you wise in the ways of the wilderness and strong with the strength of the wild you have spent your life you have waged your strife where never we play a part you have held the throne of the great unknown you have ruled a kingdom vast _but to night there's a strange new trail for you and you go o weary heart to the peace and rest of the great unguessed at last tom thorne at last the sceptic my father christmas passed away when i was barely seven at twenty one alack a day i lost my hope of heaven yet not in either lies the curse the hell of it's because i don't know which loss hurt the worse my god or santa claus the rover i oh how good it is to be foot loose and heart free just my dog and pipe and i underneath the vast sky trail to try and goal to win white road and cool inn fields to lure a lad afar clear spring and still star lilting feet that never tire green dingle fagot fire none to hurry none to hold heather hill and hushed fold nature like a picture book laughing leaf and bright brook every day a jewel bright set serenely in the night every night a holy shrine radiant for a day divine weathered cheek and kindly eye let the wanderer go by woman love and wistful heart let the gipsy one depart for the farness and the road are his glory and his goad oh the lilt of youth and spring eyes laugh and lips sing yea but it is good to be foot loose and heart free ii yet how good it is to come home at last home home on the clover swings the bee overhead's the hale tree sky of turquoise gleams through yonder glints the lake's blue in a hammock let's swing weary of wandering tired of wild uncertain lands strange faces faint hands has the wondrous world gone cold am i growing old old grey and weary let me dream glide on the tranquil stream oh what joyous days i've had full fervid gay glad yet there comes a subtile change let the stripling rove range from sweet roving comes sweet rest after all home's best and if there's a little bit of woman love with it i will count my life content god blest and well spent _oh but it is good to be foot loose and heart free yet how good it is to come home at last home home barb wire bill at dawn of day the white land lay all gruesome like and grim when bill mc'gee he says to me we've _got_ to do it jim we've got to make fort liard quick i know the river's bad but oh the little woman's sick why don't you savvy lad and me well yes i must confess it wasn't hard to see their little family group of two would soon be one of three and so i answered careless like why bill you don't suppose i'm scared of that there babbling brook whatever you say goes a real live man was barb wire bill with insides copper lined for barb wire was the brand of hooch to which he most inclined they knew him far his igloos are on kittiegazuit strand they knew him well the tribes who dwell within the barren land from koyokuk to kuskoquim his fame was everywhere and he did love all life above that little julie claire the lithe white slave girl he had bought for seven hundred skins and taken to his wickiup to make his moccasins we crawled down to the river bank and feeble folk were we that julie claire from god knows where and barb wire bill and me from shore to shore we heard the roar the heaving ice floes make and loud we laughed and launched our raft and followed in their wake the river swept and seethed and leapt and caught us in its stride and on we hurled amid a world that crashed on every side with sullen din the banks caved in the shore ice lanced the stream the naked floes like spooks arose all jiggling and agleam black anchor ice of strange device shot upward from its bed as night and day we cleft our way and arrow like we sped but faster still cried barb wire bill and looked the live long day in dull despair at julie claire as white like death she lay and sometimes he would seem to pray and sometimes seem to curse and bent above with eyes of love yet ever she grew worse and as we plunged and leapt and lunged her face was plucked with pain and i could feel his nerves of steel a quiver at the strain and in the night he gripped me tight as i lay fast asleep the river's kicking like a steer run out the forward sweep that's hell gate canyon right ahead i know of old its roar and i'll be damned _the ice is jammed we've _got_ to make the shore with one wild leap i gripped the sweep the night was black as sin the float ice crashed and ripped and smashed and stunned us with its din and near and near and clear and clear i heard the canyon boom and swift and strong we swept along to meet our awful doom and as with dread i glimpsed ahead the death that waited there my only thought was of the girl the little julie claire and so like demon mad with fear i panted at the oar and foot by foot and inch by inch we worked the raft ashore the bank was staked with grinding ice and as we scraped and crashed i only knew one thing to do and through my mind it flashed yet while i groped to find the rope i heard bill's savage cry that's my job lad it's me that jumps i'll snub this raft or die i saw him leap i saw him creep i saw him gain the land i saw him crawl i saw him fall then run with rope in hand and then the darkness gulped him up and down we dashed once more and nearer nearer drew the jam and thunder like its roar oh god all's lost from julie claire there came a wail of pain and then the rope grew sudden taut and quivered at the strain it slacked and slipped it whined and gripped and oh i held my breath and there we hung and there we swung right in the jaws of death a little strand of hempen rope and how i watched it there with all around a hell of sound and darkness and despair a little strand of hempen rope i watched it all alone and somewhere in the dark behind i heard a woman moan and somewhere in the dark ahead i heard a man cry out then silence silence silence fell and mocked my hollow shout and yet once more from out the shore i heard that cry of pain a moan of mortal agony then all was still again that night was hell with all the frills and when the dawn broke dim i saw a lean and level land but never sign of him i saw a flat and frozen shore of hideous device i saw a long drawn strand of rope that vanished through the ice and on that treeless rockless shore i found my partner dead no place was there to snub the raft so _he had served instead_ and with the rope lashed round his waist in last defiant fight he'd thrown himself beneath the ice that closed and gripped him tight and there he'd held us back from death as fast in death he lay say boys i'm not the pious brand but i just tried to pray and then i looked to julie claire and sore abashed was i for from the robes that covered her _i heard a baby cry_ thus was love conqueror of death and life for life was given and though no saint on earth d'ye think bill's squared hisself with heaven if you had the choice of two women to wed though of course the idea is quite absurd and the first from her heels to her dainty head was charming in every sense of the word and yet in the past i grieve to state she never had been exactly straight and the second she was beyond all cavil a model of virtue i must confess and yet alas she was dull as the devil and rather a dowd in the way of dress though what she was lacking in wit and beauty she more than made up for in sense of duty now suppose you must wed and make no blunder and either would love you and let you win her which of the two would you choose i wonder the stolid saint or the sparkling sinner just think just think some night the stars will gleam upon a cold grey stone and trace a name with silver beam and lo twill be your own that night is speeding on to greet your epitaphic rhyme your life is but a little beat within the heart of time a little gain a little pain a laugh lest you may moan a little blame a little fame a star gleam on a stone the lunger jack would laugh an joke all day never saw a lad so gay singin like a medder lark loaded to the plimsoll mark with god's sunshine was that boy had a strangle holt on joy held his head way up in air left no callin cards on care breezy buoyant brave and true sent his sunshine out to you cheerfulest when clouds was black happy jack oh happy jack sittin in my shack alone i could hear him in his own singin far into the night till it didn't seem just right one man should corral the fun live his life so in the sun didn't seem quite natural not to have a grouch at all not a trouble not a lack happy jack oh happy jack he was plumbful of good cheer till he struck that low down year got so thin so little to him you could most see day light through him never was his eye so bright never was his cheek so white seemed as if somethin was wrong sort o quaver in his song same old smile same hearty voice bless you boys let's all rejoice but old doctor shook his head half a lung was all he said yet that half was surely right for i heard him every night singin singin in his shack happy jack oh happy jack then one day a letter came endin with a female name seemed to get him in the neck sort o pile driver effect paled his lip and plucked his breath left him starin still as death somethin had gone awful wrong yet that night he sang his song oh but it was good to hear for there clutched my heart a fear so that i quaked listenin every night to hear him sing but each day he laughed with me an his smile was full of glee nothin seemed to set him back happy jack oh happy jack then one night the singin stopped seemed as if my heart just flopped for i'd learned to love the boy with his gilt edged line of joy with his glorious gift of bluff with his splendid fightin stuff sing on lad and play the game o dear god no singin came but there surged to me instead silence silence deep and dread till i shuddered tried to pray said he's maybe gone away oh yes he had gone away gone forever and a day but he'd left behind him there in his cabin pinched and bare his poor body skin and bone his sharp face cold as a stone an his stiffened fingers pressed somethin bright upon his breast locket with a silken curl poor sweet portrait of a girl yet i reckon at the last how defiant like he passed for there sat upon his lips smile that death could not eclipse an within his eyes lived still joy that dyin could not kill an now when the nights are long how i miss his cheery song how i sigh an wish him back happy jack oh happy jack the mountain and the lake i know a mountain thrilling to the stars peerless and pure and pinnacled with snow glimpsing the golden dawn o'er coral bars flaunting the vanisht sunset's garnet glow proudly patrician passionless serene soaring in silvered steeps where cloud surfs break virgin and vestal oh a very queen and at her feet there dreams a quiet lake my lake adores my mountain well i know for i have watched it from its dawn dream start stilling its mirror to her splendid snow framing her image in its trembling heart glassing her graciousness of greening wood kissing her throne melodiously mad thrilling responsive to her every mood gloomed with her sadness gay when she is glad my lake has dreamed and loved since time was born will love and dream till time shall cease to be gazing to her in worship half forlorn who looks towards the stars and will not see my peerless mountain splendid in her scorn alas poor little lake alas poor me the headliner and the breadliner moko the educated ape is here the pet of vaudeville so the posters say and every night the gaping people pay to see him in his panoply appear to see him pad his paunch with dainty cheer puff his perfecto swill champagne and sway just like a gentleman yet all in play then bow himself off stage with brutish leer and as to night with noble knowledge crammed i mid this human compost take my place i once a poet now so dead and damned the woeful tears half freezing on my face o god i cry let me but take his shape moko's the blest the educated ape death in the arctic i i took the clock down from the shelf at eight said i i shoot myself it lacked a _minute_ of the hour and as i waited all a cower a skinful of black boding pain bits of my life came back again mother there's nothing more to eat why don't you go out on the street always you sit and cry and cry here at my play i wonder why mother when you dress up at night red are your cheeks your eyes are bright twining a ribband in your hair kissing good bye you go down stair then i'm as lonely as can be oh how i wish you were with me yet when you go out on the street mother there's always lots to eat ii for days the igloo has been dark but now the rag wick sends a spark that glitters in the icy air and wakes frost sapphires everywhere bright bitter flames that adder like dart here and there yet fear to strike the gruesome gloom wherein _they_ lie my comrades oh so keen to die and i the last well here i wait the clock to strike the hour of eight boy it is bitter to be hurled nameless and naked on the world frozen by night and starved by day curses and kicks and clouts your pay but you must fight boy look on me anarch of all earth misery beggar and tramp and shameless sot emblem of ill in rags that rot would you be foul and base as i oh it is better far to die swear to me now you'll fight and fight boy or i'll kill you here to night iii curse this silence soft"
