"1" "at eleven o'clock and we told each other what we had to be thankful for but they gave such queer answers that papa had to run away for fear of laughing and i couldn't understand them very well susan was thankful for trunks of all things in the world cornelius for horse cars kitty for pork steak while clem who is very quiet brightened up when i came to him and said he was thankful for his lame puppy wasn't that pretty it might teach some of us a lesson mightn't it little girl that's what mama said now i'm going to give this whole christmas to the ruggleses and uncle jack i earned part of the money myself you my bird how well you see it could not be my own own christmas if papa gave me all the money and i thought to really keep christ's birthday i ought to do something of my very own and so i talked with mama of course she thought of something lovely she always does mama's head is just brimming over with lovely thoughts and all i have to do is ask and out pops the very one i want this thought was to let her write down just as i told her a description of how a little girl lived in her own room three years and what she did to amuse herself and we sent it to a magazine and got twenty five dollars for it just think well well cried uncle jack my little girl a real author and what are you going to do with this wonderful own money of yours i shall give the nine ruggleses a grand christmas dinner here in this very room that will be papa's contribution and afterwards a beautiful christmas tree fairly blooming with presents that will be my part for i have another way of adding to my twenty five dollars so that i can buy everything i like i should like it very much if you would sit at the head of the table uncle jack for nobody could ever be frightened of you you dearest dearest dearest thing that ever was mama is going to help us but papa and the boys are going to eat together down stairs for fear of making the little ruggleses shy and after we've had a merry time with the tree we can open my window and all listen together to the music at the evening church service if it comes before the children go i have written a letter to the organist and asked him if i might have the two songs i like best will you see if it is all right birds nest dec 21st 188 dear mr wilkie i am the little sick girl who lives next door to the church and as i seldom go out the music on practice days and sundays is one of my greatest pleasures i want to know if you can let the boys sing carol brothers carol on christmas night and if the one who sings my ain countree so beautifully may please sing that too i think it is the loveliest song in the world but it always makes me cry doesn't it you if it isn't too much trouble i hope they can sing them both quite early as after ten o'clock i may be asleep yours respectfully carol bird p.s the reason i like carol brothers carol is because the choir boys sang it eleven years ago the morning i was born and put it into mama's head to call me carol she didn't remember then that my other name would be bird because she was half asleep and couldn't think of but one thing at a time donald says if i had been born on the fourth of july they would have named me independence or if on the twenty second of february georgina or even cherry like cherry in martin chuzzlewit but i like my own name and birthday best yours truly carol bird uncle jack thought the letter quite right and did not even smile at her telling the organist so many family items the days flew by as they always fly in holiday time and it was christmas eve before anybody knew it the family festival was quiet and very pleasant but quite swallowed up in the grander preparations for next day carol and elfrida her pretty german nurse had ransacked books and introduced so many plans and plays and customs and merry makings from germany and holland and england and a dozen other places that you would scarcely have known how or where you were keeping christmas the dog and the cat had enjoyed their celebration under carol's direction each had a tiny table with a lighted candle in the center and a bit of bologna sausage placed very near it and everybody laughed till the tears stood in their eyes to see villikins and dinah struggle to nibble the sausages and at the same time evade the candle flame villikins barked and sniffed and howled in impatience and after many vain attempts succeeded in dragging off the prize though he singed his nose in doing it dinah meanwhile watched him placidly her delicate nostrils quivering with expectation and after all excitement had subsided walked with dignity to the table her beautiful gray satin tail sweeping behind her and calmly putting up one velvet paw drew the sausage gently down and walked out of the room without turning a hair so to speak elfrida had scattered handfuls of seeds over the snow in the garden that the wild birds might have a comfortable breakfast next morning and had stuffed bundles of dried grasses in the fireplaces so that the reindeer of santa claus could refresh themselves after their long gallops across country this was really only done for fun but it pleased carol and when after dinner the whole family had gone to church to see the christmas decorations carol limped wearily out on her little crutches and with elfrida's help placed all the family boots in a row in the upper hall that was to keep the dear ones from quarreling all through the year there were papa's stout top boots mama's pretty buttoned shoes next then uncle jack's donald's paul's and hugh's and at the end of the line her own little white worsted slippers last and sweetest of all like the little children in austria she put a lighted candle in her window to guide the dear christ child lest he should stumble in the dark night as he passed up the deserted street this done she dropped into bed a rather tired but very happy christmas fairy v some other birds are taught to fly before the earliest ruggles could wake and toot his five cent tin horn mrs ruggles was up and stirring about the house for it was a gala day in the family gala day i should think so were not her nine childern invited to a dinner party at the great house and weren't they going to sit down free and equal with the mightiest in the land she had been preparing for this grand occasion ever since the receipt of the invitation which by the way had been speedily enshrined in an old photograph frame and hung under the looking glass in the most prominent place in the kitchen where it stared the occasional visitor directly in the eye and made him pale with envy birds nest dec 17th 188 dear mrs ruggles i am going to have a dinner party on christmas day and would like to have all your children come i want them every one please from sarah maud to baby larry mama says dinner will be at half past five and the christmas tree at seven so you may expect them home at nine o'clock wishing you a merry christmas and a happy new year i am yours truly carol bird breakfast was on the table promptly at seven o'clock and there was very little of it too for it was an excellent day for short rations though mrs ruggles heaved a sigh as she reflected that even the boys with their india rubber stomachs would be just as hungry the day after the dinner party as if they had never had any at all as soon as the scanty meal was over she announced the plan of the campaign now susan you an kitty wash up the dishes an peter can't you spread up the beds so't i can git ter cuttin out larry's new suit i ain't satisfied with his close an i thought in the night of a way to make him a dress out of my old plaid shawl kind o scotch style yer know you other boys clear out from under foot clem you and con hop into bed with larry while i wash yer underflannins twont take long to dry em sarah maud i think twould be perfeckly han'som if you ripped them brass buttons off yer uncle's policeman's coat an

run out and ask mis cullen ter lend me a pair o stockin's for peory an tell her if she will peory'll give jim half her candy when she gets home won't yer peory peoria was young and greedy and thought the remedy so much worse than the disease that she set up a deafening howl at the projected bargain a howl so rebellious and so out of all season that her mother started in her direction with flashing eye and uplifted hand but she let it fall suddenly saying no i won't lick ye christmas day if yer drive me crazy but speak up smart now n say whether yer'd ruther give tim cullen half yer candy or go bare legged ter the party the matter being put so plainly peoria collected her faculties dried her tears and chose the lesser evil clem having hastened the decision by an affectionate wink that meant he'd go halves with her on his candy that's a lady cried her mother now you young ones that ain't doin nothin play all yer want ter before noontime for after ye git through eatin at twelve o'clock me n sarah maud's goin ter give yer such a washin an combin an dressin as yer never had before an never will agin an then i'm goin to set yer down an give yer two solid hours trainin in manners an twon't be no foolin neither all we've got ter do s go eat grumbled peter well that's enough responded his mother there's more n one way of eatin let me tell yer an you've got a heap ter learn about it peter ruggles lord sakes i wish you childern could see the way i was fetched up to eat never took a meal o vittles in the kitchen before i married ruggles but yer can't keep up that style with nine young ones n yer pa always off ter sea the big ruggleses worked so well and the little ruggleses kept from under foot so successfully that by one o'clock nine complete toilets were laid out in solemn grandeur on the beds i say complete but i do not know whether they would be called so in the best society the law of compensation had been well applied he that had necktie had no cuffs she that had sash had no handkerchief and vice versa but they all had boots and a certain amount of clothing such as it was the outside layer being in every case quite above criticism now sarah maud said mrs ruggles her face shining with excitement everything is red up an we can begin i've got a boiler n a kettle n a pot o hot water peter you go into the back bedroom an i'll take susan kitty peory an cornelius an sarah maud you take clem n eily n larry one to a time an git as fur as you can with em an then i'll finish em off while you do yerself sarah maud couldn't have scrubbed with any more decision and force if she had been doing floors and the little ruggleses bore it bravely not from natural heroism but for the joy that was set before them not being satisfied however with the tone of their complexions she wound up operations by applying a little bristol brick from the knife board which served as the proverbial last straw from under which the little ruggleses issued rather red and raw and out of temper when the clock struck three they were all clothed and most of them in their right minds ready for those last touches that always take the most time kitty's red hair was curled in thirty four ringlets sarah maud's was braided in one pig tail and susan's and eily's in two braids apiece while peoria's resisted all advances in the shape of hair oils and stuck out straight on all sides like that of the circassian girl of the circus so clem said and he was sent into the bed room for it too from whence he was dragged out forgivingly by peoria herself five minutes later then exciting moment came linen collars for some and neckties and bows for others and eureka the ruggleses were dressed and solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these a row of seats was formed directly through the middle of the kitchen there were not quite chairs enough for ten since the family had rarely all wanted to sit down at once somebody always being out or in bed but the wood box and the coal hod finished out the line nicely the children took their places according to age sarah maud at the head and larry on the coal hod and mrs ruggles seated herself in front surveying them proudly as she wiped the sweat of honest toil from her brow well she exclaimed if i do say so as shouldn't i never see a cleaner more stylish mess o childern in my life i do wish ruggles could look at ye for a minute now i've of en told ye what kind of a family the mcgrills was i've got some reason to be proud your uncle is on the po lice force o new york city you can take up the newspaper most any day an see his name printed right out james mcgrill and i can't have my childern fetched up common like some folks when they go out they've got to have close and learn ter act decent now i want ter see how yer goin to behave when yer git there to night let's start in at the beginnin n act out the whole business pile into the bed room there every last one of ye an show me how yer goin ter go in't the parlor this'll be the parlor n i'll be mis bird the youngsters hustled into the next room in high glee and mrs ruggles drew herself up in her chair with an infinitely haughty and purse proud expression that much better suited a descendant of the mcgrills than modest mrs bird the bed room was small and there presently ensued such a clatter that you would have thought a herd of wild cattle had broken loose the door opened and they straggled in all the little ones giggling with sarah maud at the head looking as if she had been caught in the act of stealing sheep while larry being last in line seemed to think the door a sort of gate of heaven which would be shut in his face if he didn't get there in time accordingly he struggled ahead of his elders and disgraced himself by tumbling in head foremost mrs ruggles looked severe there i knew yer'd do it in some sech fool way try it agin n if larry can't come in on two legs he can stay ter home the matter began to assume a graver aspect the little ruggleses stopped giggling and backed into the bed room issuing presently with lock step indian file a scared and hunted expression in every countenance no no no cried mrs ruggles in despair yer look for all the world like a gang o pris'ners there ain't no style ter that spread out more can't yer an act kind o careless like nobody's goin ter kill ye the third time brought deserved success and the pupils took their seats in the row now yer know said mrs ruggles there ain't enough decent hats to go round an if there was i don know s i'd let yer wear em for the boys would never think to take em off when they got inside but anyhow there ain't enough good ones now look me in the eye you needn't wear no hats none of yer en when yer get int the parlor n they ask yer ter lay off yer hats sarah maud must speak up an say it was sech a pleasant evenin an sech a short walk that you left yer hats to home to save trouble now can you remember all the little ruggleses shouted yes marm in chorus what have you got ter do with it demanded their mother did i tell you to say it wasn't i talkin ter sarah maud the little ruggleses hung their diminished heads yes marm they piped more feebly now git up all of ye an try it speak up sarah maud sarah maud's tongue clove to the roof of her mouth quick ma thought it was sech a pleasant hat that we'd we'd better leave our short walk to home recited sarah maud in an agony of mental effort this was too much for the boys oh whatever shall i do with ye moaned the unhappy mother i suppose i've got to learn it to yer which she did word for word until sarah maud thought she could stand on her head and say it backwards now cornelius what are you goin ter say ter make yerself good comp'ny dunno said cornelius turning pale well ye ain't goin to set there like a bump on a log thout sayin a word ter pay for yer vittles air ye ask mis bird how she's feelin this evenin or if mr bird's havin a busy season or somethin like that now we'll make b'lieve we've got ter the dinner that won't be so hard cause yer'll have somethin to do it's awful bothersome ter stan round an act stylish if they have napkins sarah maud down to peory may put em in their laps n the rest of ye can tuck em in yer necks don't eat with yer fingers don't grab no vittles off one nother's plates don't reach out for nothin but wait till yer asked n if yer never git asked don't git up and grab it don't spill nothin on the table cloth or like's not mis bird ll send yer away from the table now we'll try a few things ter see how they'll go mr clement do you eat cramb'ry sarse bet yer life cried clem who not having taken in the idea exactly had mistaken this for an ordinary family question clement ruggles do you mean to tell me that you'd say that to a dinner party i'll give ye one more chance mr clement will you take some of the cramb'ry yes marm thank ye kindly if you happen ter have any handy very good indeed mr peter do you speak for white or dark meat i ain't particler as ter color anything that nobody else wants will suit me answered peter with his best air first rate nobody could speak more genteel than that miss kitty will you have hard or soft sarse with your pudden a little of both if you please an i'm much obliged said kitty with decided ease and grace at which all the other ruggleses pointed the finger of shame at her and peter grunted expressively that their meaning might not be mistaken you just stop your gruntin peter ruggles that was all right i wish i could git it inter your heads that it ain't so much what yer say as the way yer say it eily you an larry's too little to train so you just look at the rest an do s they do an the lord have mercy on ye an help ye to act decent now is there anything more ye'd like to practice if yer tell me one more thing i can't set up an eat said peter gloomily i'm so cram full o manners now i'm ready ter bust thout no dinner at all me too chimed in cornelius well i'm sorry for yer both rejoined mrs ruggles sarcastically if the mount o manners yer've got on hand now troubles ye you're dreadful easy hurt now sarah maud after dinner about once in so often you must say i guess we'd better be goin an if they say oh no set a while longer yer can stay but if they don't say nothin you've got ter get up an go can you remember about once in so often could any words in the language be fraught with more terrible and wearing uncertainty well answered sarah maud mournfully seems as if this whole dinner party set right square on top o me maybe i could manage my own manners but ter manage nine mannerses is worse n staying to home oh don't fret said her mother good naturedly i guess you'll git along i wouldn't mind if folks would only say oh childern will be childern but they won't they'll say land o goodness who fetched them childern up now it's quarter past five you can go an whatever yer do don't forget your mother was a mcgrill vi when the pie was opened the birds began to sing the children went out the back door quietly and were presently lost to sight sarah maud slipping and stumbling along absent mindedly as she recited under her breath it was such a pleasant evenin an sech a short walk we thought we'd leave our hats to home peter rang the door bell and presently a servant admitted them and whispering something in sarah's ear drew her downstairs into the kitchen the other ruggleses stood in horror stricken groups as the door closed behind their commanding officer but there was no time for reflection for a voice from above was heard saying come right up stairs please theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why theirs but to do or die accordingly they walked upstairs and elfrida the nurse ushered them into a room more splendid than anything they had ever seen but oh woe where was sarah maud and was it fate that mrs bird should say at once did you lay your hats in the hall peter felt himself elected by circumstance the head of the family and casting one imploring look at tongue tied susan standing next him said huskily it was so very pleasant that that that we hadn't good hats enough to go round put in little susan bravely to help him out and then froze with horror that the ill fated words had slipped off her tongue however mrs bird said pleasantly of course you wouldn't wear hats such a short distance i forgot when i asked now will you come right in to miss carol's room she is so anxious to see you just then sarah maud came up the back stairs so radiant with joy from her secret interview with the cook that peter could have pinched her with a clear conscience and carol gave them a joyful welcome but where is baby larry she cried looking over the group with searching eye didn't he come larry larry good gracious where was larry they were all sure that he had come in with them for susan remembered scolding him for tripping over the door mat uncle jack went into convulsions of laughter are you sure there were nine of you he asked merrily i think so sir said peoria timidly but anyhow there was larry and she showed signs of weeping oh well cheer up cried uncle jack i guess he's not lost only mislaid i'll go and find him before you can say jack robinson i'll go too if you please sir said sarah maud for it was my place to mind him an if he's lost i can't relish my vittles the other ruggleses stood rooted to the floor was this a dinner party forsooth and if so why were such things ever spoken of as festive occasions sarah maud went out through the hall calling larry larry and without any interval of suspense a thin voice piped up from below here i be the truth was that larry being deserted by his natural guardian dropped behind the rest and wriggled into the hat tree to wait for her having no notion of walking unprotected into the jaws of a dinner party finding that she did not come he tried to crawl from his refuge and call somebody when dark and dreadful ending to a tragic day he found that he was too much intertwined with umbrellas and canes to move a single step he was afraid to yell when i have said this of larry ruggles i have pictured a state of helpless terror that ought to wring tears from every eye and the sound of sarah maud's beloved voice some seconds later was like a strain of angel music in his ears uncle jack dried his tears carried him upstairs and soon had him in breathless fits of laughter while carol so made the other ruggleses forget themselves that they were soon talking like accomplished diners out carol's bed had been moved into the farthest corner of the room and she was lying on the outside dressed in a wonderful soft white wrapper her golden hair fell in soft fluffy curls over her white forehead and neck her cheeks flushed delicately her eyes beamed with joy and the children told their mother afterwards that she looked as beautiful as the pictures of the blessed virgin there was great bustle behind a huge screen in another part of the room and at half past five this was taken away and the christmas dinner table stood revealed what a wonderful sight it was to the poor little ruggles children who ate their sometimes scanty meals on the kitchen table it blazed with tall colored candles it gleamed with glass and silver it blushed with flowers it groaned with good things to eat so it was not strange that the ruggleses forgetting that their mother was a mcgrill shrieked in admiration of the fairy spectacle but larry's behavior was the most disgraceful for he stood not upon the order of his going but went at once for a high chair that pointed unmistakably to him climbed up like a squirrel gave a comprehensive look at the turkey clapped his hands in ecstacy rested his fat arms on the table and cried with joy i beat the hull lot o yer carol laughed until she cried giving orders meanwhile uncle jack please sit at the head sarah maud at the foot and that will leave four on each side mama is going to help elfrida so that the children need not look after each other but just have a good time a sprig of holly lay by each plate and nothing would do but each little ruggles must leave his seat and have it pinned on by carol and as each course was served one of them pleaded to take something to her there was hurrying to and fro i can assure you for it is quite a difficult matter to serve a christmas dinner on the third floor of a great city house but if every dish had had to be carried up a rope ladder the servants would gladly have done so there was turkey and chicken with delicious gravy and stuffing and there were half a dozen vegetables with cranberry jelly and celery and pickles and as for the way these delicacies were served the ruggleses never forgot it as long as they lived peter nudged kitty who sat next him and said look will yer ev'ry feller's got his own partic'lar butter i suppose that's to show yer can eat that much n no more no it ain't neither for that pig of a peory's just gittin another helpin yes whispered kitty an the napkins is marked with big red letters i wonder if that's so nobody ll nip em an oh peter look at the pictures painted right on ter the dishes did yer ever the plums is all took out o my cramb'ry sarse an it's friz to a stiff jell shouted peoria in wild excitement hi yah i got a wish bone sung larry regardless of sarah maud's frown after which she asked to have his seat changed giving as excuse that he gen'ally set beside her an would feel strange the true reason being that she desired"
