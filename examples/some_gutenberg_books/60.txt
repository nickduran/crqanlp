"1" "do and e not satisfied see what you'll get that's all reluctantly sally obeyed is you xpecting special guests then to night mr jellyband asked jimmy pitkin in a loyal attempt to divert his host's attention from the circumstances connected with sally's exit from the room aye that i be replied jellyband friends of my lord tony hisself dukes and duchesses from over the water yonder whom the young lord and his friend sir andrew ffoulkes and other young noblemen have helped out of the clutches of them murderin devils but this was too much for mr hempseed's querulous philosophy lud he said what do they do that for i wonder i don't old not with interferin in other folks ways as the scriptures say maybe mr empseed interrupted jellyband with biting sarcasm as you're a personal friend of mr pitt and as you says along with mr fox let em murder says you pardon me mr jellyband feebly protested mr hempseed i dunno as i ever did but mr jellyband had at last succeeded in getting upon his favourite hobby horse and had no intention of dismounting in any hurry or maybe you've made friends with some of them french chaps oo they do say have come over here o purpose to make us englishmen agree with their murderin ways i dunno what you mean mr jellyband suggested mr hempseed all i know is all _i_ know is loudly asserted mine host that there was my friend peppercorn oo owns the blue faced boar an as true and loyal an englishman as you'd see in the land and now look at im e made friends with some o them frog eaters obnobbed with them just as if they was englishmen and not just a lot of immoral godforsaking furrin spies well and what happened peppercorn e now ups and talks of revolutions and liberty and down with the aristocrats just like mr empseed over ere pardon me mr jellyband again interposed mr hempseed feebly i dunno as i ever did mr jellyband had appealed to the company in general who were listening awe struck and open mouthed at the recital of mr peppercorn's defalcations at one table two customers gentlemen apparently by their clothes had pushed aside their half finished game of dominoes and had been listening for some time and evidently with much amusement at mr jellyband's international opinions one of them now with a quiet sarcastic smile still lurking round the corners of his mobile mouth turned towards the centre of the room where mr jellyband was standing you seem to think mine honest friend he said quietly that these frenchmen spies i think you called them are mighty clever fellows to have made mincemeat so to speak of your friend mr peppercorn's opinions how did they accomplish that now think you lud sir i suppose they talked im over those frenchies i've eard it said ave got the gift of gab and mr empseed ere will tell you ow it is that they just twist some people round their little finger like indeed and is that so mr hempseed inquired the stranger politely nay sir replied mr hempseed much irritated i dunno as i can give you the information you require faith then said the stranger let us hope my worthy host that these clever spies will not succeed in upsetting your extremely loyal opinions but this was too much for mr jellyband's pleasant equanimity he burst into an uproarious fit of laughter which was soon echoed by those who happened to be in his debt hahaha hohoho hehehe he laughed in every key did my worthy host and laughed until his sides ached and his eyes streamed at me hark at that did ye ear im say that they'd be upsettin my opinions eh lud love you sir but you do say some queer things well mr jellyband said mr hempseed sententiously you know what the scriptures say let im oo stands take eed lest e fall but then hark'ee mr empseed retorted jellyband still holding his sides with laughter the scriptures didn't know me why i wouldn't so much as drink a glass of ale with one o them murderin frenchmen and nothin d make me change my opinions why i've eard it said that them frog eaters can't even speak the king's english so of course if any of em tried to speak their god forsaken lingo to me why i should spot them directly see and forewarned is forearmed as the saying goes aye my honest friend assented the stranger cheerfully i see that you are much too sharp and a match for any twenty frenchmen and here's to your very good health my worthy host if you'll do me the honour to finish this bottle of mine with me i am sure you're very polite sir said mr jellyband wiping his eyes which were still streaming with the abundance of his laughter and i don't mind if i do the stranger poured out a couple of tankards full of wine and having offered one to mine host he took the other himself loyal englishmen as we all are he said whilst the same humorous smile played round the corners of his thin lips loyal as we are we must admit that this at least is one good thing which comes to us from france aye we'll none of us deny that sir assented mine host and here's to the best landlord in england our worthy host mr jellyband said the stranger in a loud tone of voice hi hip hurrah retorted the whole company present then there was a loud clapping of hands and mugs and tankards made a rattling music upon the tables to the accompaniment of loud laughter at nothing in particular and of mr jellyband's muttered exclamations just fancy me bein talked over by any god forsaken furriner what lud love you sir but you do say some queer things to which obvious fact the stranger heartily assented it was certainly a preposterous suggestion that anyone could ever upset mr jellyband's firmly rooted opinions anent the utter worthlessness of the inhabitants of the whole continent of europe chapter iii the refugees feeling in every part of england certainly ran very high at this time against the french and their doings smugglers and legitimate traders between the french and the english coasts brought snatches of news from over the water which made every honest englishman's blood boil and made him long to have a good go at those murderers who had imprisoned their king and all his family subjected the queen and the royal children to every species of indignity and were even now loudly demanding the blood of the whole bourbon family and of every one of its adherents the execution of the princesse de lamballe marie antoinette's young and charming friend had filled every one in england with unspeakable horror the daily execution of scores of royalists of good family whose only sin was their aristocratic name seemed to cry for vengeance to the whole of civilised europe yet with all that no one dared to interfere burke had exhausted all his eloquence in trying to induce the british government to fight the revolutionary government of france but mr pitt with characteristic prudence did not feel that this country was fit yet to embark on another arduous and costly war it was for austria to take the initiative austria whose fairest daughter was even now a dethroned queen imprisoned and insulted by a howling mob surely twas not so argued mr fox for the whole of england to take up arms because one set of frenchmen chose to murder another as for mr jellyband and his fellow john bulls though they looked upon all foreigners with withering contempt they were royalist and anti revolutionists to a man and at this present moment were furious with pitt for his caution and moderation although they naturally understood nothing of the diplomatic reasons which guided that great man's policy by now sally came running back very excited and very eager the joyous company in the coffee room had heard nothing of the noise outside but she had spied a dripping horse and rider who had stopped at the door of the fisherman's rest and while the stable boy ran forward to take charge of the horse pretty miss sally went to the front door to greet the welcome visitor i think i see'd my lord antony's horse out in the yard father she said as she ran across the coffee room but already the door had been thrown open from outside and the next moment an arm covered in drab cloth and dripping with the heavy rain was round pretty sally's waist while a hearty voice echoed along the polished rafters of the coffee room aye and bless your brown eyes for being so sharp my pretty sally said the man who had just entered whilst worthy mr jellyband came bustling forward eager alert and fussy as became the advent of one of the most favoured guests of his hostel lud i protest sally added lord antony as he deposited a kiss on miss sally's blooming cheeks but you are growing prettier and prettier every time i see you and my honest friend jellyband here have hard work to keep the fellows off that slim waist of yours what say you mr waite mr waite torn between his respect for my lord and his dislike of that particular type of joke only replied with a doubtful grunt lord antony dewhurst one of the sons of the duke of exeter was in those days a very perfect type of a young english gentlemen tall well set up broad of shoulders and merry of face his laughter rang loudly wherever he went a good sportsman a lively companion a courteous well bred man of the world with not too much brains to spoil his temper he was a universal favourite in london drawing rooms or in the coffee rooms of village inns at the fisherman's rest everyone knew him for he was fond of a trip across to france and always spent a night under worthy mr jellyband's roof on his way there or back he nodded to waite pitkin and the others as he at last released sally's waist and crossed over to the hearth to warm and dry himself as he did so he cast a quick somewhat suspicious glance at the two strangers who had quietly resumed their game of dominoes and for a moment a look of deep earnestness even of anxiety clouded his jovial young face but only for a moment the next he turned to mr hempseed who was respectfully touching his forelock well mr hempseed and how is the fruit badly my lord badly replied mr hempseed dolefully but what can you xpect with this ere government favourin them rascals over in france who would murder their king and all their nobility odd's life retorted lord antony so they would honest hempseed at least those they can get hold of worse luck but we have got some friends coming here to night who at any rate have evaded their clutches it almost seemed when the young man said these words as if he threw a defiant look towards the quiet strangers in the corner thanks to you my lord and to your friends so i've heard it said said mr jellyband but in a moment lord antony's hand fell warningly on mine host's arm hush he said peremptorily and instinctively once again looked towards the strangers oh lud love you they are all right my lord retorted jellyband don't you be afraid i wouldn't have spoken only i knew we were among friends that gentleman over there is as true and loyal a subject of king george as you are yourself my lord saving your presence he is but lately arrived in dover and is setting down in business in these parts in business faith then it must be as an undertaker for i vow i never beheld a more rueful countenance nay my lord i believe that the gentleman is a widower which no doubt would account for the melancholy of his bearing but he is a friend nevertheless i'll vouch for that and you will own my lord that who should judge of a face better than the landlord of a popular inn oh that's all right then if we are among friends said lord antony who evidently did not care to discuss the subject with his host but tell me you have no one else staying here have you no one my lord and no one coming either leastways leastways no one your lordship would object to i know who is it well my lord sir percy blakeney and his lady will be here presently but they ain't a goin to stay lady blakeney queried lord antony in some astonishment aye my lord sir percy's skipper was here just now he says that my lady's brother is crossing over to france to day in the day dream which is sir percy's yacht and sir percy and my lady will come with him as far as here to see the last of him it don't put you out do it my lord no no it doesn't put me out friend nothing will put me out unless that supper is not the very best which miss sally can cook and which has ever been served in the fisherman's rest you need have no fear of that my lord said sally who all this while had been busy setting the table for supper and very gay and inviting it looked with a large bunch of brilliantly coloured dahlias in the centre and the bright pewter goblets and blue china about how many shall i lay for my lord five places pretty sally but let the supper be enough for ten at least our friends will be tired and i hope hungry as for me i vow i could demolish a baron of beef to night here they are i do believe said sally excitedly as a distant clatter of horses and wheels could now be distinctly heard drawing rapidly nearer there was a general commotion in the coffee room everyone was curious to see my lord antony's swell friends from over the water miss sally cast one or two quick glances at the little bit of mirror which hung on the wall and worthy mr jellyband bustled out in order to give the first welcome himself to his distinguished guests only the two strangers in the corner did not participate in the general excitement they were calmly finishing their game of dominoes and did not even look once towards the door straight ahead comtesse the door on your right said a pleasant voice outside aye there they are all right enough said lord antony joyfully off with you my pretty sally and see how quick you can dish up the soup the door was thrown wide open and preceded by mr jellyband who was profuse in his bows and welcomes a party of four two ladies and two gentlemen entered the coffee room welcome welcome to old england said lord antony effusively as he came eagerly forward with both hands outstretched towards the newcomers ah you are lord antony dewhurst i think said one of the ladies speaking with a strong foreign accent at your service madame he replied as he ceremoniously kissed the hands of both the ladies then turned to the men and shook them both warmly by the hand sally was already helping the ladies to take off their travelling cloaks and both turned with a shiver towards the brightly blazing hearth there was a general movement among the company in the coffee room sally had bustled off to her kitchen whilst jellyband still profuse with his respectful salutations arranged one or two chairs around the fire mr hempseed touching his forelock was quietly vacating the seat in the hearth everyone was staring curiously yet deferentially at the foreigners ah messieurs what can i say said the elder of the two ladies as she stretched a pair of fine aristocratic hands to the warmth of the blaze and looked with unspeakable gratitude first at lord antony then at one of the young men who had accompanied her party and who was busy divesting himself of his heavy caped coat only that you are glad to be in england comtesse replied lord antony and that you have not suffered too much from your trying voyage indeed indeed we are glad to be in england she said while her eyes filled with tears and we have already forgotten all that we have suffered her voice was musical and low and there was a great deal of calm dignity and of many sufferings nobly endured marked in the handsome aristocratic face with its wealth of snowy white hair dressed high above the forehead after the fashion of the times i hope my friend sir andrew ffoulkes proved an entertaining travelling companion madame ah indeed sir andrew was kindness itself how could my children and i ever show enough gratitude to you all messieurs her companion a dainty girlish figure childlike and pathetic in its look of fatigue and of sorrow had said nothing as yet but her eyes large brown and full of tears looked up from the fire and sought those of sir andrew ffoulkes who had drawn near to the hearth and to her then as they met his which were fixed with unconcealed admiration upon the sweet face before him a thought of warmer colour rushed up to her pale cheeks so this is england she said as she looked round with childlike curiosity at the great hearth the oak rafters and the yokels with their elaborate smocks and jovial rubicund british countenances a bit of it mademoiselle replied sir andrew smiling but all of it at your service the young girl blushed again but this time a bright smile fleet and sweet illumined her dainty face she said nothing and sir andrew too was silent yet those two young people understood one another as young people have a way of doing all the world over and have done since the world began but i say supper here broke in lord antony's jovial voice supper honest jellyband where is that pretty wench of yours and the dish of soup zooks man while you stand there gaping at the ladies they will faint with hunger one moment one moment my lord said jellyband as he threw open the door that led to the kitchen and shouted lustily sally hey sally there are ye ready my girl sally was ready and the next moment she appeared in the doorway carrying a gigantic tureen from which rose a cloud of steam and an abundance of savoury odour odd's life supper at last ejaculated lord antony merrily as he gallantly offered his arm to the comtesse may i have the honour he added ceremoniously as he led her towards the supper table there was a general bustle in the coffee room mr hempseed and most of the yokels and fisher folk had gone to make way for the quality and to finish smoking their pipes elsewhere only the two strangers stayed on quietly and unconcernedly playing their game of dominoes and sipping their wine whilst at another table harry waite who was fast losing his temper watched pretty sally bustling round the table she looked a very dainty picture of english rural life and no wonder that the susceptible young frenchman could scarce take his eyes off her pretty face the vicomte de tournay was scarce nineteen a beardless boy on whom terrible tragedies which were being enacted in his own country had made but little impression he was elegantly and even foppishly dressed and once safely landed in england he was evidently ready to forget the horrors of the revolution in the delights of english life pardi if zis is england he said as he continued to ogle sally with marked satisfaction i am of it satisfied it would be impossible at this point to record the exact exclamation which escaped through mr harry waite's clenched teeth only respect for the quality and notably for my lord antony kept his marked disapproval of the young foreigner in check nay but this is england you abandoned young reprobate interposed lord antony with a laugh and do not i pray bring your loose foreign ways into this most moral country lord antony had already sat down at the head of the table with the comtesse on his right jellyband was bustling round filling glasses and putting chairs straight sally waited ready to hand round the soup mr harry waite's friends had at last succeeded in taking him out of the room for his temper was growing more and more violent under the vicomte's obvious admiration for sally suzanne came in stern commanding accents from the rigid comtesse suzanne blushed again she had lost count of time and of place whilst she had stood beside the fire allowing the handsome young englishman's eyes to dwell upon her sweet face and his hand as if unconsciously to rest upon hers her mother's voice brought her back to reality once more and with a submissive yes mama she took her place at the supper table chapter iv the league of the scarlet pimpernel they all looked a merry even a happy party as they sat round the table sir andrew ffoulkes and lord antony dewhurst two typical good looking well born and well bred englishmen of that year of grace 1792 and the aristocratic french comtesse with her two children who had just escaped from such dire perils and found a safe retreat at last on the shores of protecting england in the corner the two strangers had apparently finished their game one of them arose and standing with his back to the merry company at the table he adjusted with much deliberation his large triple caped coat as he did so he gave one quick glance all around him everyone was busy laughing and chatting and he murmured the words all safe his companion then with the alertness borne of long practice slipped on to his knees in a moment and the next had crept noiselessly under the oak bench the stranger then with a loud good night quietly walked out of the coffee room not one of those at the supper table had noticed this curious and silent manoeuvre but when the stranger finally closed the door of the coffee room behind him they all instinctively sighed a sigh of relief alone at last said lord antony jovially then the young vicomte de tournay rose glass in hand and with the graceful affection peculiar to the times he raised it aloft and said in broken english to his majesty george three of england god bless him for his hospitality to us all poor exiles from france his majesty the king echoed lord antony and sir andrew as they drank loyally to the toast to his majesty king louis of france added sir andrew with solemnity may god protect him and give him victory over his enemies everyone rose and drank this toast in silence the fate of the unfortunate king of france then a prisoner of his own people seemed to cast a gloom even over mr jellyband's pleasant countenance and to m le comte de tournay de basserive said lord antony merrily may we welcome him in england before many days are over ah monsieur said the comtesse as with a slightly trembling hand she conveyed her glass to her lips i scarcely dare to hope but already lord antony had served out the soup and for the next few moments all conversation ceased while jellyband and sally handed round the plates and everyone began to eat faith madame said lord antony after a while mine was no idle toast seeing yourself mademoiselle suzanne and my friend the vicomte safely in england now surely you must feel reasurred as to the fate of monsieur le comte ah monsieur replied the comtesse with a heavy sigh i trust in god i can but pray and hope aye madame here interposed sir andrew ffoulkes trust in god by all means but believe also a little in your english friends who have sworn to bring the count safely across the channel even as they have brought you to day indeed indeed monsieur she replied i have the fullest confidence in you and your friends your fame i assure you has spread throughout the whole of france the way some of my own friends have escaped from the clutches of that awful revolutionary tribunal was nothing short of a miracle and all done by you and your friends we were but the hands madame la comtesse but my husband monsieur said the comtesse whilst unshed tears seemed to veil her voice he is in such deadly peril i would never have left him only there were my children i was torn between my duty to him and to them they refused to go without me and you and your friends assured me so solemnly that my husband would be safe but oh now that i am here amongst you all in this beautiful free england i think of him flying for his life hunted like a poor beast in such peril ah i should not have left him i should not have left him the poor woman had completely broken down fatigue sorrow and emotion had overmastered her rigid aristocratic bearing she was crying gently to herself whilst suzanne ran up to her and tried to kiss away her tears lord antony and sir andrew had said nothing to interrupt the comtesse whilst she was speaking there was no doubt that they felt deeply for her their very silence testified to that but in every century and ever since england has been what it is an englishman has always felt somewhat ashamed of his own emotion and of his own sympathy and so the two young men said nothing and busied themselves in trying to hide their feelings only succeeding in looking immeasurably sheepish as for me monsieur said suzanne suddenly as she looked through a wealth of brown curls across at sir andrew i trust you absolutely and i know that you will bring my dear father safely to england just as you brought us to day this was said with so much confidence such unuttered hope and belief that it seemed as if by magic to dry the mother's eyes and to bring a smile upon everybody's lips nay you shame me mademoiselle replied sir andrew though my life is at your service i have been but a humble tool in the hands of our great leader who organised and effected your escape he had spoken with so much warmth and vehemence that suzanne's eyes fastened upon him in undisguised wonder your leader monsieur said the comtesse eagerly ah of course you must have a leader and i did not think of that before but tell me where is he i must go to him at once and i and my children must throw ourselves at his feet and thank him for all that he has done for us alas madame said lord antony that is impossible impossible why because the scarlet pimpernel works in the dark and his identity is only known under the solemn oath of secrecy to his immediate followers the scarlet pimpernel said suzanne with a merry laugh why what a droll name what is the scarlet pimpernel monsieur she looked at sir andrew with eager curiosity the young man's face had become almost transfigured his eyes shone with enthusiasm hero worship love admiration for his leader seemed literally to glow upon his face the scarlet pimpernel mademoiselle he said at last is the name of a humble english wayside flower but it is also the name chosen to hide the identity of the best and bravest man in all the world so that he may better succeed in accomplishing the noble task he has set himself to do ah yes here interposed the young vicomte i have heard speak of this scarlet pimpernel a little flower red yes they say in paris that every time a royalist escapes to england that devil foucquier tinville the public prosecutor receives a paper with that little flower designated in red upon it yes yes that is so assented lord antony then he will have received one such paper to day undoubtedly oh i wonder what he will say said suzanne merrily i have heard that the picture of that little red flower is the only thing that frightens him faith then said sir andrew he will have many more opportunities of studying the shape of that small scarlet flower ah monsieur sighed the comtesse it all sounds like a romance and i cannot understand it all why should you try madame but tell me why should your leader why should you all spend your money and risk your lives for it is your lives you risk messieurs when you set foot in france and all for us french men and women who are nothing to you sport madame la comtesse sport asserted lord antony with his jovial loud and pleasant voice we are a nation of sportsmen you know and just now it is the fashion to pull the hare from between the teeth of the hound ah no no not sport only monsieur you have a more noble motive i am sure for the good work you"
