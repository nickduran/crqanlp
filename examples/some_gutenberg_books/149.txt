"1" "had been a third set which only alvarez had known was aboard the coldwater we waited impatiently for the sun that we might determine our exact location and upon the fourth day our vigil was rewarded a few minutes before noon every officer and man aboard was tense with nervous excitement as we awaited the result of the reading the crew had known almost as soon as i that we were doomed to cross thirty and i am inclined to believe that every man jack of them was tickled to death for the spirits of adventure and romance still live in the hearts of men of the twenty second century even though there be little for them to feed upon between thirty and one hundred seventy five the men carried none of the burdens of responsibility they might cross thirty with impunity and doubtless they would return to be heroes at home but how different the home coming of their commanding officer the wind had dropped to a steady blow still from west by north and the sea had gone down correspondingly the crew with the exception of those whose duties kept them below were ranged on deck below the bridge when our position was definitely fixed i personally announced it to the eager waiting men men i said stepping forward to the handrail and looking down into their upturned bronzed faces you are anxiously awaiting information as to the ship's position it has been determined at latitude fifty degrees seven minutes north longitude twenty degrees sixteen minutes west i paused and a buzz of animated comment ran through the massed men beneath me beyond thirty but there will be no change in commanding officers in routine or in discipline until after we have docked again in new york as i ceased speaking and stepped back from the rail there was a roar of applause from the deck such as i never before had heard aboard a ship of peace it recalled to my mind tales that i had read of the good old days when naval vessels were built to fight when ships of peace had been man of war and guns had flashed in other than futile target practice and decks had run red with blood with the subsistence of the sea we were able to go to work upon the damaged engines to some effect and i also set men to examining the gravitation screen generators with a view to putting them in working order should it prove not beyond our resources for two weeks we labored at the engines which indisputably showed evidence of having been tampered with i appointed a board to investigate and report upon the disaster but it accomplished nothing other than to convince me that there were several officers upon it who were in full sympathy with johnson for though no charges had been preferred against him the board went out of its way specifically to exonerate him in its findings all this time we were drifting almost due east the work upon the engines had progressed to such an extent that within a few hours we might expect to be able to proceed under our own power westward in the direction of pan american waters to relieve the monotony i had taken to fishing and early that morning i had departed from the coldwater in one of the boats on such an excursion a gentle west wind was blowing the sea shimmered in the sunlight a cloudless sky canopied the west for our sport as i had made it a point never voluntarily to make an inch toward the east that i could avoid at least they should not be able to charge me with a willful violation of the dead lines regulation i had with me only the boat's ordinary complement of men three in all and more than enough to handle any small power boat i had not asked any of my officers to accompany me as i wished to be alone and very glad am i now that i had not my only regret is that in view of what befell us it had been necessary to bring the three brave fellows who manned the boat our fishing which proved excellent carried us so far to the west that we no longer could see the coldwater the day wore on until at last about mid afternoon i gave the order to return to the ship we had proceeded but a short distance toward the east when one of the men gave an exclamation of excitement at the same time pointing eastward we all looked on in the direction he had indicated and there a short distance above the horizon we saw the outlines of the coldwater silhouetted against the sky they've repaired the engines and the generators both exclaimed one of the men it seemed impossible but yet it had evidently been done only that morning lieutenant johnson had told me that he feared that it would be impossible to repair the generators i had put him in charge of this work since he always had been accounted one of the best gravitation screen men in the navy he had invented several of the improvements that are incorporated in the later models of these generators and i am convinced that he knows more concerning both the theory and the practice of screening gravitation than any living pan american at the sight of the coldwater once more under control the three men burst into a glad cheer but for some reason which i could not then account i was strangely overcome by a premonition of personal misfortune it was not that i now anticipated an early return to pan america and a board of inquiry for i had rather looked forward to the fight that must follow my return no there was something else something indefinable and vague that cast a strange gloom upon me as i saw my ship rising farther above the water and making straight in our direction i was not long in ascertaining a possible explanation of my depression for though we were plainly visible from the bridge of the aero submarine and to the hundreds of men who swarmed her deck the ship passed directly above us not five hundred feet from the water and sped directly westward we all shouted and i fired my pistol to attract their attention though i knew full well that all who cared to had observed us but the ship moved steadily away growing smaller and smaller to our view until at last she passed completely out of sight 2 what could it mean i had left alvarez in command he was my most loyal subordinate it was absolutely beyond the pale of possibility that alvarez should desert me no there was some other explanation something occurred to place my second officer porfirio johnson in command i was sure of it but why speculate the futility of conjecture was only too palpable the coldwater had abandoned us in midocean doubtless none of us would survive to know why the young man at the wheel of the power boat had turned her nose about as it became evident that the ship intended passing over us and now he still held her in futile pursuit of the coldwater bring her about snider i directed and hold her due east we can't catch the coldwater and we can't cross the atlantic in this our only hope lies in making the nearest land which unless i am mistaken is the scilly islands off the southwest coast of england ever heard of england snider there's a part of the united states of north america that used to be known to the ancients as new england he replied is that where you mean sir no snider i replied the england i refer to was an island off the continent of europe it was the seat of a very powerful kingdom that flourished over two hundred years ago a part of the united states of north america and all of the federated states of canada once belonged to this ancient england europe breathed one of the men his voice tense with excitement my grandfather used to tell me stories of the world beyond thirty he had been a great student and he had read much from forbidden books in which i resemble your grandfather i said for i too have read more even than naval officers are supposed to read and as you men know we are permitted a greater latitude in the study of geography and history than men of other professions among the books and papers of admiral porter turck who lived two hundred years ago and from whom i am descended many volumes still exist and are in my possession which deal with the history and geography of ancient europe usually i bring several of these books with me upon a cruise and this time among others i have maps of europe and her surrounding waters i was studying them as we came away from the coldwater this morning and luckily i have them with me you are going to try to make europe sir asked taylor the young man who had last spoken it is the nearest land i replied i have always wanted to explore the forgotten lands of the eastern hemisphere here's our chance to remain at sea is to perish none of us ever will see home again let us make the best of it and enjoy while we do live that which is forbidden the balance of our race the adventure and the mystery which lie beyond thirty taylor and delcarte seized the spirit of my mood but snider i think was a trifle sceptical it is treason sir i replied but there is no law which compels us to visit punishment upon ourselves could we return to pan america i should be the first to insist that we face it but we know that's not possible even if this craft would carry us so far we haven't enough water or food for more than three days we are doomed snider to die far from home and without ever again looking upon the face of another fellow countryman than those who sit here now in this boat isn't that punishment sufficient for even the most exacting judge even snider had to admit that it was very well then let us live while we live and enjoy to the fullest whatever of adventure or pleasure each new day brings since any day may be our last and we shall be dead for a considerable while i could see that snider was still fearful but taylor and delcarte responded with a hearty aye aye sir they were of different mold both were sons of naval officers they represented the aristocracy of birth and they dared to think for themselves snider was in the minority and so we continued toward the east beyond thirty and separated from my ship my authority ceased i held leadership if i was to hold it at all by virtue of personal qualifications only but i did not doubt my ability to remain the director of our destinies in so far as they were amenable to human agencies i have always led while my brain and brawn remain unimpaired i shall continue always to lead following is an art which turcks do not easily learn it was not until the third day that we raised land dead ahead which i took from my map to be the isles of scilly but such a gale was blowing that i did not dare attempt to land and so we passed to the north of them skirted land's end and entered the english channel i think that up to that moment i had never experienced such a thrill as passed through me when i realized that i was navigating these historic waters the lifelong dreams that i never had dared hope to see fulfilled were at last a reality but under what forlorn circumstances never could i return to my native land to the end of my days i must remain in exile yet even these thoughts failed to dampen my ardor my eyes scanned the waters to the north i could see the rockbound coast of cornwall mine were the first american eyes to rest upon it for more than two hundred years in vain i searched for some sign of ancient commerce that if history is to be believed must have dotted the bosom of the channel with white sails and blackened the heavens with the smoke of countless funnels but as far as eye could reach the tossing waters of the channel were empty and deserted toward midnight the wind and sea abated so that shortly after dawn i determined to make inshore in an attempt to effect a landing for we were sadly in need of fresh water and food according to my observations we were just off ram head and it was my intention to enter plymouth bay and visit plymouth from my map it appeared that this city lay back from the coast a short distance and there was another city given as devonport which appeared to lie at the mouth of the river tamar however i knew that it would make little difference which city we entered as the english people were famed of old for their hospitality toward visiting mariners as we approached the mouth of the bay i looked for the fishing craft which i expected to see emerging thus early in the day for their labors but even after we rounded ram head and were well within the waters of the bay i saw no vessel neither was there buoy nor light nor any other mark to show larger ships the channel and i wondered much at this the coast was densely overgrown nor was any building or sign of man apparent from the water up the bay and into the river tamar we motored through a solitude as unbroken as that which rested upon the waters of the channel for all we could see there was no indication that man had ever set his foot upon this silent coast i was nonplused and then for the first time there crept over me an intuition of the truth here was no sign of war as far as this portion of the devon coast was concerned that seemed to have been over for many years but neither were there any people yet i could not find it within myself to believe that i should find no inhabitants in england reasoning thus i discovered that it was improbable that a state of war still existed and that the people all had been drawn from this portion of england to some other where they might better defend themselves against an invader but what of their ancient coast defenses what was there here in plymouth bay to prevent an enemy landing in force and marching where they wished nothing i could not believe that any enlightened military nation such as the ancient english are reputed to have been would have voluntarily so deserted an exposed coast and an excellent harbor to the mercies of an enemy i found myself becoming more and more deeply involved in quandary the puzzle which confronted me i could not unravel we had landed and i now stood upon the spot where according to my map a large city should rear its spires and chimneys there was nothing but rough broken ground covered densely with weeds and brambles and tall rank grass had a city ever stood there no sign of it remained the roughness and unevenness of the ground suggested something of a great mass of debris hidden by the accumulation of centuries of undergrowth i drew the short cutlass with which both officers and men of the navy are as you know armed out of courtesy to the traditions and memories of the past and with its point dug into the loam about the roots of the vegetation growing at my feet the blade entered the soil for a matter of seven inches when it struck upon something stonelike digging about the obstacle i presently loosened it and when i had withdrawn it from its sepulcher i found the thing to be an ancient brick of clay baked in an oven delcarte we had left in charge of the boat but snider and taylor were with me and following my example each engaged in the fascinating sport of prospecting for antiques each of us uncovered a great number of these bricks until we commenced to weary of the monotony of it when snider suddenly gave an exclamation of excitement and as i turned to look he held up a human skull for my inspection i took it from him and examined it directly in the center of the forehead was a small round hole the gentleman had evidently come to his end defending his country from an invader snider again held aloft another trophy of the search a metal spike and some tarnished and corroded metal ornaments they had lain close beside the skull with the point of his cutlass snider scraped the dirt and verdigris from the face of the larger ornament an inscription he said and handed the thing to me they were the spike and ornaments of an ancient german helmet before long we had uncovered many other indications that a great battle had been fought upon the ground where we stood but i was then and still am at loss to account for the presence of german soldiers upon the english coast so far from london which history suggests would have been the natural goal of an invader i can only account for it by assuming that either england was temporarily conquered by the teutons or that an invasion of so vast proportions was undertaken that german troops were hurled upon the england coast in huge numbers and that landings were necessarily effected at many places simultaneously subsequent discoveries tend to strengthen this view we dug about for a short time with our cutlasses until i became convinced that a city had stood upon the spot at some time in the past and that beneath our feet crumbled and dead lay ancient devonport i could not repress a sigh at the thought of the havoc war had wrought in this part of england at least farther east nearer london we should find things very different there would be the civilization that two centuries must have wrought upon our english cousins as they had upon us there would be mighty cities cultivated fields happy people there we would be welcomed as long lost brothers there would we find a great nation anxious to learn of the world beyond their side of thirty as i had been anxious to learn of that which lay beyond our side of the dead line i turned back toward the boat come men i said we will go up the river and fill our casks with fresh water search for food and fuel and then tomorrow be in readiness to push on toward the east i am going to london 3 the report of a gun blasted the silence of a dead devonport with startling abruptness it came from the direction of the launch and in an instant we three were running for the boat as fast as our legs would carry us as we came in sight of it we saw delcarte a hundred yards inland from the launch leaning over something which lay upon the ground as we called to him he waved his cap and stooping lifted a small deer for our inspection i was about to congratulate him on his trophy when we were startled by a horrid half human half bestial scream a little ahead and to the right of us it seemed to come from a clump of rank and tangled bush not far from where delcarte stood it was a horrid fearsome sound the like of which never had fallen upon my ears before we looked in the direction from which it came the smile had died from delcarte's lips even at the distance we were from him i saw his face go suddenly white and he quickly threw his rifle to his shoulder at the same moment the thing that had given tongue to the cry moved from the concealing brushwood far enough for us too to see it both taylor and snider gave little gasps of astonishment and dismay what is it sir asked the latter the creature stood about the height of a tall man's waist and was long and gaunt and sinuous with a tawny coat striped with black and with white throat and belly in conformation it was similar to a cat a huge cat exaggerated colossal cat with fiendish eyes and the most devilish cast of countenance as it wrinkled its bristling snout and bared its great yellow fangs it was pacing or rather slinking straight for delcarte who had now leveled his rifle upon it what is it sir mumbled snider again and then a half forgotten picture from an old natural history sprang to my mind and i recognized in the frightful beast the felis tigris of ancient asia specimens of which had in former centuries been exhibited in the western hemisphere snider and taylor were armed with rifles and revolvers while i carried only a revolver seizing snider's rifle from his trembling hands i called to taylor to follow me and together we ran forward shouting to attract the beast's attention from delcarte until we should all be quite close enough to attack with the greatest assurance of success i cried to delcarte not to fire until we reached his side for i was fearful lest our small caliber steel jacketed bullets should far from killing the beast tend merely to enrage it still further but he misunderstood me thinking that i had ordered him to fire with the report of his rifle the tiger stopped short in apparent surprise then turned and bit savagely at its shoulder for an instant after which it wheeled again toward delcarte issuing the most terrific roars and screams and launched itself with incredible speed toward the brave fellow who now stood his ground pumping bullets from his automatic rifle as rapidly as the weapon would fire taylor and i also opened up on the creature and as it was broadside to us it offered a splendid target though for all the impression we appeared to make upon the great cat we might as well have been launching soap bubbles at it straight as a torpedo it rushed for delcarte and as taylor and i stumbled on through the tall grass toward our unfortunate comrade we saw the tiger rear upon him and crush him to the earth not a backward step had the noble delcarte taken two hundred years of peace had not sapped the red blood from his courageous line he went down beneath that avalanche of bestial savagery still working his gun and with his face toward his antagonist even in the instant that i thought him dead i could not help but feel a thrill of pride that he was one of my men one of my class a pan american gentleman of birth and that he had demonstrated one of the principal contentions of the army and navy adherents that military training was necessary for the salvation of personal courage in the pan american race which for generations had had to face no dangers more grave than those incident to ordinary life in a highly civilized community safeguarded by every means at the disposal of a perfectly organized and all powerful government utilizing the best that advanced science could suggest as we ran toward delcarte both taylor and i were struck by the fact that the beast upon him appeared not to be mauling him but lay quiet and motionless upon its prey and when we were quite close and the muzzles of our guns were at the animal's head i saw the explanation of this sudden cessation of hostilities felis tigris was dead one of our bullets or one of the last that delcarte fired had penetrated the heart and the beast had died even as it sprawled forward crushing delcarte to the ground a moment later with our assistance the man had scrambled from beneath the carcass of his would be slayer without a scratch to indicate how close to death he had been delcarte's buoyance was entirely unruffled he came from under the tiger with a broad grin on his handsome face nor could i perceive that a muscle trembled or that his voice showed the least indication of nervousness or excitement with the termination of the adventure we began to speculate upon the explanation of the presence of this savage brute at large so great a distance from its native habitat my readings had taught me that it was practically unknown outside of asia and that so late as the twentieth century at least there had been no savage beasts outside captivity in england as we talked snider joined us and i returned his rifle to him taylor and delcarte picked up the slain deer and we all started down toward the launch walking slowly delcarte wanted to fetch the tiger's skin but i had to deny him permission since we had no means to properly cure it upon the beach we skinned the deer and cut away as much meat as we thought we could dispose of and as we were again embarking to continue up the river for fresh water and fuel we were startled by a series of screams from the bushes a short distance away another felis tigris said taylor or a dozen of them supplemented delcarte and even as he spoke there leaped into sight one after another eight of the beasts full grown magnificent specimens at the sight of us they came charging down like infuriated demons i saw that three rifles would be no match for them and so i gave the word to put out from shore hoping that the tiger as the ancients called him could not swim sure enough they all halted at the beach pacing back and forth uttering fiendish cries and glaring at us in the most malevolent manner as we motored away we presently heard the calls of similar animals far inland they seemed to be answering the cries of their fellows at the water's edge and from the wide distribution and great volume of the sound we came to the conclusion that enormous numbers of these beasts must roam the adjacent country they have eaten up the inhabitants murmured snider shuddering i imagine you are right i agreed for their extreme boldness and fearlessness in the presence of man would suggest either that man is entirely unknown to them or that they are extremely familiar with him as their natural and most easily procured prey but where did they come from asked delcarte could they have traveled here from asia i shook my head the thing was a puzzle to me i knew that it was practically beyond reason to imagine that tigers had crossed the mountain ranges and rivers and all the great continent of europe to travel this far from their native lairs and entirely impossible that they should have crossed the english channel at all yet here they were and in great numbers we continued up the tamar several miles filled our casks and then landed to cook some of our deer steak and have the first square meal that had fallen to our lot since the coldwater deserted us but scarce had we built our fire and prepared the meat for cooking than snider whose eyes had been constantly roving about the landscape from the moment that we left the launch touched me on the arm and pointed to a clump of bushes which grew a couple of hundred yards away half concealed behind their screening foliage i saw the yellow and black of a big tiger and as i looked the beast stalked majestically toward us a moment later he was followed by another and another and it is needless to state that we beat a hasty retreat to the launch the country was apparently infested by these huge carnivora for after three other attempts to land and cook our food we were forced to abandon the idea entirely as each time we were driven off by hunting tigers it was also equally impossible to obtain the necessary ingredients for our chemical fuel and as we had very little left aboard we determined to step our folding mast and proceed under sail hoarding our fuel supply for use in emergencies i may say that it was with no regret that we bid adieu to tigerland as we rechristened the ancient devon and beating out into the channel turned the launch's nose southeast to round bolt head and continue up the coast toward the strait of dover and the north sea i was determined to reach london as soon as possible that we might obtain fresh clothing meet with cultured people and learn from the lips of englishmen the secrets of the two centuries since the east had been divorced from the west our first stopping place was the isle of wight we entered the solent about ten o'clock one morning and i must confess that my heart sank as we came close to shore no lighthouse was visible though one was plainly indicated upon my map upon neither shore was sign of human habitation we skirted the northern"
