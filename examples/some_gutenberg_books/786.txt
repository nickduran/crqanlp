"1" "then here i am mrs gradgrind anyhow and nobody to thank for my being here but myself mrs gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother _my_ mother bolted ma’am said bounderby mrs gradgrind stunned as usual collapsed and gave it up my mother left me to my grandmother said bounderby and according to the best of my remembrance my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived if i got a little pair of shoes by any chance she would take em off and sell em for drink why i have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four teen glasses of liquor before breakfast mrs gradgrind weakly smiling and giving no other sign of vitality looked as she always did like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure without enough light behind it she kept a chandler’s shop pursued bounderby and kept me in an egg box that was the cot of _my_ infancy an old egg box as soon as i was big enough to run away of course i ran away then i became a young vagabond and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me they were right they had no business to do anything else i was a nuisance an incumbrance and a pest i know that very well his pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance an incumbrance and a pest was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast i was to pull through it i suppose mrs gradgrind whether i was to do it or not ma’am i did it i pulled through it though nobody threw me out a rope vagabond errand boy vagabond labourer porter clerk chief manager small partner josiah bounderby of coketown those are the antecedents and the culmination josiah bounderby of coketown learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops mrs gradgrind and was first able to tell the time upon a dial plate from studying the steeple clock of st giles’s church london under the direction of a drunken cripple who was a convicted thief and an incorrigible vagrant tell josiah bounderby of coketown of your district schools and your model schools and your training schools and your whole kettle of fish of schools and josiah bounderby of coketown tells you plainly all right all correct he hadn’t such advantages but let us have hard headed solid fisted people the education that made him won’t do for everybody he knows well such and such his education was however and you may force him to swallow boiling fat but you shall never force him to suppress the facts of his life being heated when he arrived at this climax josiah bounderby of coketown stopped he stopped just as his eminently practical friend still accompanied by the two young culprits entered the room his eminently practical friend on seeing him stopped also and gave louisa a reproachful look that plainly said behold your bounderby well blustered mr bounderby what’s the matter what is young thomas in the dumps about he spoke of young thomas but he looked at louisa we were peeping at the circus muttered louisa haughtily without lifting up her eyes and father caught us and mrs gradgrind said her husband in a lofty manner i should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry dear me whimpered mrs gradgrind how can you louisa and thomas i wonder at you i declare you’re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all i have a great mind to say i wish i hadn’t _then_ what would you have done i should like to know mr gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks he frowned impatiently as if with my head in its present throbbing state you couldn’t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you instead of circuses said mrs gradgrind you know as well as i do no young people have circus masters or keep circuses in cabinets or attend lectures about circuses what can you possibly want to know of circuses then i am sure you have enough to do if that’s what you want with my head in its present state i couldn’t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to that’s the reason pouted louisa don’t tell me that’s the reason because it can’t be nothing of the sort said mrs gradgrind go and be somethingological directly mrs gradgrind was not a scientific character and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit in truth mrs gradgrind’s stock of facts in general was woefully defective but mr gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position had been influenced by two reasons firstly she was most satisfactory as a question of figures and secondly she had no nonsense about her by nonsense he meant fancy and truly it is probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot ever was the simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and mr bounderby was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact so she once more died away and nobody minded her bounderby said mr gradgrind drawing a chair to the fireside you are always so interested in my young people particularly in louisa that i make no apology for saying to you i am very much vexed by this discovery i have systematically devoted myself as you know to the education of the reason of my family the reason is as you know the only faculty to which education should be addressed and yet bounderby it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to day though in itself a trifling one as if something had crept into thomas’s and louisa’s minds which is or rather which is not i don’t know that i can express myself better than by saying which has never been intended to be developed and in which their reason has no part there certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds returned bounderby when i was a vagabond myself nobody looked with any interest at _me_ i know that then comes the question said the eminently practical father with his eyes on the fire in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise i’ll tell you in what in idle imagination i hope not said the eminently practical i confess however that the misgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home in idle imagination gradgrind repeated bounderby a very bad thing for anybody but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa i should ask mrs gradgrind’s pardon for strong expressions but that she knows very well i am not a refined character whoever expects refinement in _me_ will be disappointed i hadn’t a refined bringing up whether said gradgrind pondering with his hands in his pockets and his cavernous eyes on the fire whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything whether louisa or thomas can have been reading anything whether in spite of all precautions any idle story book can have got into the house because in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line from the cradle upwards this is so curious so incomprehensible stop a bit cried bounderby who all this time had been standing as before on the hearth bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility you have one of those strollers children in the school cecilia jupe by name said mr gradgrind with something of a stricken look at his friend now stop a bit cried bounderby again how did she come there why the fact is i saw the girl myself for the first time only just now she specially applied here at the house to be admitted as not regularly belonging to our town and yes you are right bounderby you are right now stop a bit cried bounderby once more louisa saw her when she came louisa certainly did see her for she mentioned the application to me but louisa saw her i have no doubt in mrs gradgrind’s presence pray mrs gradgrind said bounderby what passed oh my poor health returned mrs gradgrind the girl wanted to come to the school and mr gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school and louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come and that mr gradgrind wanted girls to come and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact now i tell you what gradgrind said mr bounderby turn this girl to the right about and there’s an end of it i am much of your opinion do it at once said bounderby has always been my motto from a child when i thought i would run away from my egg box and my grandmother i did it at once do you the same do this at once are you walking asked his friend i have the father’s address perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me not the least in the world said mr bounderby as long as you do it at once so mr bounderby threw on his hat he always threw it on as expressing a man who had been far too busily employed in making himself to acquire any fashion of wearing his hat and with his hands in his pockets sauntered out into the hall i never wear gloves it was his custom to say i didn’t climb up the ladder in _them_ shouldn’t be so high up if i had being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while mr gradgrind went up stairs for the address he opened the door of the children’s study and looked into that serene floor clothed apartment which notwithstanding its book cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned and philosophical appliances had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to hair cutting louisa languidly leaned upon the window looking out without looking at anything while young thomas stood sniffing revengefully at the fire adam smith and malthus two younger gradgrinds were out at lecture in custody and little jane after manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe clay on her face with slate pencil and tears had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions it’s all right now louisa it’s all right young thomas said mr bounderby you won’t do so any more i’ll answer for it’s being all over with father well louisa that’s worth a kiss isn’t it you can take one mr bounderby returned louisa when she had coldly paused and slowly walked across the room and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him with her face turned away always my pet ain’t you louisa said mr bounderby good bye louisa he went his way but she stood on the same spot rubbing the cheek he had kissed with her handkerchief until it was burning red she was still doing this five minutes afterwards what are you about loo her brother sulkily remonstrated you’ll rub a hole in your face you may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like tom i wouldn’t cry chapter v the keynote coketown to which messrs bounderby and gradgrind now walked was a triumph of fact it had no greater taint of fancy in it than mrs gradgrind herself let us strike the key note coketown before pursuing our tune it was a town of red brick or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it but as matters stood it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage it was a town of machinery and tall chimneys out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever and never got uncoiled it had a black canal in it and a river that ran purple with ill smelling dye and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long and where the piston of the steam engine worked monotonously up and down like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness it contained several large streets all very like one another and many small streets still more like one another inhabited by people equally like one another who all went in and out at the same hours with the same sound upon the same pavements to do the same work and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and to morrow and every year the counterpart of the last and the next these attributes of coketown were in the main inseparable from the work by which it was sustained against them were to be set off comforts of life which found their way all over the world and elegancies of life which made we will not ask how much of the fine lady who could scarcely bear to hear the place mentioned the rest of its features were voluntary and they were these you saw nothing in coketown but what was severely workful if the members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done they made it a pious warehouse of red brick with sometimes but this is only in highly ornamental examples a bell in a birdcage on the top of it the solitary exception was the new church a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs all the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike in severe characters of black and white the jail might have been the infirmary the infirmary might have been the jail the town hall might have been either or both or anything else for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction fact fact fact everywhere in the material aspect of the town fact fact fact everywhere in the immaterial the m’choakumchild school was all fact and the school of design was all fact and the relations between master and man were all fact and everything was fact between the lying in hospital and the cemetery and what you couldn’t state in figures or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest was not and never should be world without end amen a town so sacred to fact and so triumphant in its assertion of course got on well why no not quite well no dear me no coketown did not come out of its own furnaces in all respects like gold that had stood the fire first the perplexing mystery of the place was who belonged to the eighteen denominations because whoever did the labouring people did not it was very strange to walk through the streets on a sunday morning and note how few of _them_ the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad called away from their own quarter from their own close rooms from the corners of their own streets where they lounged listlessly gazing at all the church and chapel going as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this because there was a native organization in coketown itself whose members were to be heard of in the house of commons every session indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main force then came the teetotal society who complained that these same people _would_ get drunk and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk and proved at tea parties that no inducement human or divine except a medal would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk then came the chemist and druggist with other tabular statements showing that when they didn’t get drunk they took opium then came the experienced chaplain of the jail with more tabular statements outdoing all the previous tabular statements and showing that the same people _would_ resort to low haunts hidden from the public eye where they heard low singing and saw low dancing and mayhap joined in it and where a b aged twenty four next birthday and committed for eighteen months solitary had himself said not that he had ever shown himself particularly worthy of belief his ruin began as he was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he would have been a tip top moral specimen then came mr gradgrind and mr bounderby the two gentlemen at this present moment walking through coketown and both eminently practical who could on occasion furnish more tabular statements derived from their own personal experience and illustrated by cases they had known and seen from which it clearly appeared in short it was the only clear thing in the case that these same people were a bad lot altogether gentlemen that do what you would for them they were never thankful for it gentlemen that they were restless gentlemen that they never knew what they wanted that they lived upon the best and bought fresh butter and insisted on mocha coffee and rejected all but prime parts of meat and yet were eternally dissatisfied and unmanageable in short it was the moral of the old nursery fable there was an old woman and what do you think she lived upon nothing but victuals and drink victuals and drink were the whole of her diet and yet this old woman would never be quiet is it possible i wonder that there was any analogy between the case of the coketown population and the case of the little gradgrinds surely none of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures are to be told at this time of day that one of the foremost elements in the existence of the coketown working people had been for scores of years deliberately set at nought that there was any fancy in them demanding to be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in convulsions that exactly in the ratio as they worked long and monotonously the craving grew within them for some physical relief some relaxation encouraging good humour and good spirits and giving them a vent some recognized holiday though it were but for an honest dance to a stirring band of music some occasional light pie in which even m’choakumchild had no finger which craving must and would be satisfied aright or must and would inevitably go wrong until the laws of the creation were repealed this man lives at pod’s end and i don’t quite know pod’s end said mr gradgrind which is it bounderby mr bounderby knew it was somewhere down town but knew no more respecting it so they stopped for a moment looking about almost as they did so there came running round the corner of the street at a quick pace and with a frightened look a girl whom mr gradgrind recognized halloa said he stop where are you going stop girl number twenty stopped then palpitating and made him a curtsey why are you tearing about the streets said mr gradgrind in this improper manner i was i was run after sir the girl panted and i wanted to get away run after repeated mr gradgrind who would run after _you_ the question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her by the colourless boy bitzer who came round the corner with such blind speed and so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement that he brought himself up against mr gradgrind’s waistcoat and rebounded into the road what do you mean boy said mr gradgrind what are you doing how dare you dash against everybody in this manner bitzer picked up his cap which the concussion had knocked off and backing and knuckling his forehead pleaded that it was an accident was this boy running after you jupe asked mr gradgrind yes sir said the girl reluctantly no i wasn’t sir cried bitzer not till she run away from me but the horse riders never mind what they say sir they’re famous for it you know the horse riders are famous for never minding what they say addressing sissy it’s as well known in the town as please sir as the multiplication table isn’t known to the horse riders bitzer tried mr bounderby with this he frightened me so said the girl with his cruel faces oh cried bitzer oh an’t you one of the rest an’t you a horse rider i never looked at her sir i asked her if she would know how to define a horse to morrow and offered to tell her again and she ran away and i ran after her sir that she might know how to answer when she was asked you wouldn’t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn’t been a horse rider her calling seems to be pretty well known among em observed mr bounderby you’d have had the whole school peeping in a row in a week truly i think so returned his friend bitzer turn you about and take yourself home jupe stay here a moment let me hear of your running in this manner any more boy and you will hear of me through the master of the school you understand what i mean go along the boy stopped in his rapid blinking knuckled his forehead again glanced at sissy turned about and retreated now girl said mr gradgrind take this gentleman and me to your father’s we are going there what have you got in that bottle you are carrying gin said mr bounderby dear no sir it’s the nine oils the what cried mr bounderby the nine oils sir to rub father with then said mr bounderby with a loud short laugh what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for it’s what our people aways use sir when they get any hurts in the ring replied the girl looking over her shoulder to assure herself that her pursuer was gone they bruise themselves very bad sometimes serve em right said mr bounderby for being idle she glanced up at his face with mingled astonishment and dread by george said mr bounderby when i was four or five years younger than you i had worse bruises upon me than ten oils twenty oils forty oils would have rubbed off i didn’t get em by posture making but by being banged about there was no rope dancing for me i danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope mr gradgrind though hard enough was by no means so rough a man as mr bounderby his character was not unkind all things considered it might have been a very kind one indeed if he had only made some round mistake in the arithmetic that balanced it years ago he said in what he meant for a reassuring tone as they turned down a narrow road and this is pod’s end is it jupe this is it sir and if you wouldn’t mind sir this is the house she stopped at twilight at the door of a mean little public house with dim red lights in it as haggard and as shabby as if for want of custom it had itself taken to drinking and had gone the way all drunkards go and was very near the end of it it’s only crossing the bar sir and up the stairs if you wouldn’t mind and waiting there for a moment till i get a candle if you should hear a dog sir it’s only merrylegs and he only barks merrylegs and nine oils eh said mr bounderby entering last with his metallic laugh pretty well this for a self made man chapter vi sleary’s horsemanship the name of the public house was the pegasus’s arms the pegasus’s legs might have been more to the purpose but underneath the winged horse upon the sign board the pegasus’s arms was inscribed in roman letters beneath that inscription again in a flowing scroll the painter had touched off the lines good malt makes good beer walk in and they’ll draw it here good wine makes good brandy give us a call and you’ll find it handy framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar was another pegasus a theatrical one with real gauze let in for his wings golden stars stuck on all over him and his ethereal harness made of red silk as it had grown too dusky without to see the sign and as it had not grown light enough within to see the picture mr gradgrind and mr bounderby received no offence from these idealities they followed the girl up some steep corner stairs without meeting any one and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle they expected every moment to hear merrylegs give tongue but the highly trained performing dog had not barked when the girl and the candle appeared together father is not in our room sir she said with a face of great surprise if you wouldn’t mind walking in i’ll find him directly they walked in and sissy having set two chairs for them sped away with a quick light step it was a mean shabbily furnished room with a bed in it the white night cap embellished with two peacock’s feathers and a pigtail bolt upright in which signor jupe had that very afternoon enlivened the varied performances with his chaste shaksperean quips and retorts hung upon a nail but no other portion of his wardrobe or other token of himself or his pursuits was to be seen anywhere as to merrylegs that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who went aboard the ark might have been accidentally shut out of it for any sign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the pegasus’s arms they heard the doors of rooms above opening and shutting as sissy went from one to another in quest of her father and presently they heard voices expressing surprise she came bounding down again in a great hurry opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk found it empty and looked round with her hands clasped and her face full of terror father must have gone down to the booth sir i don’t know why he should go there but he must be there i’ll bring him in a minute she was gone directly without her bonnet with her long dark childish hair streaming behind her what does she mean said mr gradgrind back in a minute it’s more than a mile off before mr bounderby could reply a young man appeared at the door and introducing himself with the words by your leaves gentlemen walked in with his hands in his pockets his face close shaven thin and sallow was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair brushed into a roll all round his head and parted up the centre his legs were very robust but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been his chest and back were as much too broad as his legs were too short he was dressed in a newmarket coat and tight fitting trousers wore a shawl round his neck smelt of lamp oil straw orange peel horses provender and sawdust and looked a most remarkable sort of centaur compounded of the stable and the play house where the one began and the other ended nobody could have told with any precision this gentleman was mentioned in the bills of the day as mr e w b childers so justly celebrated for his daring vaulting act as the wild huntsman of the north american prairies in which popular performance a diminutive boy with an old face who now accompanied him assisted as his infant son being carried upside down over his father’s shoulder by one foot and held by the crown of his head heels upwards in the palm of his father’s hand according to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be observed to fondle their offspring made up with curls wreaths wings white bismuth and carmine this hopeful young person soared into so pleasing a cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part of the spectators but in private where his characteristics were a precocious cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice he became of the turf turfy by your leaves gentlemen said mr e w b childers glancing round the room it was you i believe that were wishing to see jupe it was said mr gradgrind his daughter has gone to fetch him but i can’t wait therefore if you please i will leave a message for him with you you see my friend mr bounderby put in we are the kind of people who know the value of time and you are the kind of people who don’t know the value of time i have not retorted mr childers after surveying him from head to foot the honour of knowing _you_ but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than i can of mine i should judge from your appearance that you are about right and when you have made it you can keep it too i should think said cupid kidderminster stow that said mr childers"
