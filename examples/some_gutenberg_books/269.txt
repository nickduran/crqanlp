"1" "but if i had said _nourriture obligatoire_ you wouldn’t have had the least idea what i was talking about _mais maintenant_ _nous parlons français_ oh very well _trés bien_ said mrs stossen reluctantly in moments of flurry such french as she knew was not under very good control _là_ _à l’autre côté de la porte_ _est un cochon_ _un cochon_ _ah_ _le petit charmant_ exclaimed matilda with enthusiasm _mais non_ _pas du tout petit_ _et pas du tout charmant_ _un bête féroce_ _une bête_ corrected matilda a pig is masculine as long as you call it a pig but if you lose your temper with it and call it a ferocious beast it becomes one of us at once french is a dreadfully unsexing language for goodness sake let us talk english then said mrs stossen is there any way out of this garden except through the paddock where the pig is i always go over the wall by way of the plum tree said matilda dressed as we are we could hardly do that said mrs stossen it was difficult to imagine her doing it in any costume do you think you could go and get some one who would drive the pig away asked miss stossen i promised my aunt i would stay here till five o’clock it’s not four yet i am sure under the circumstances your aunt would permit my conscience would not permit said matilda with cold dignity we can’t stay here till five o’clock exclaimed mrs stossen with growing exasperation shall i recite to you to make the time pass quicker asked matilda obligingly belinda the little breadwinner is considered my best piece or perhaps it ought to be something in french henri quatre’s address to his soldiers is the only thing i really know in that language if you will go and fetch some one to drive that animal away i will give you something to buy yourself a nice present said mrs stossen matilda came several inches lower down the medlar tree that is the most practical suggestion you have made yet for getting out of the garden she remarked cheerfully claude and i are collecting money for the children’s fresh air fund and we are seeing which of us can collect the biggest sum i shall be very glad to contribute half a crown very glad indeed said mrs stossen digging that coin out of the depths of a receptacle which formed a detached outwork of her toilet claude is a long way ahead of me at present continued matilda taking no notice of the suggested offering you see he’s only eleven and has golden hair and those are enormous advantages when you’re on the collecting job only the other day a russian lady gave him ten shillings russians understand the art of giving far better than we do i expect claude will net quite twenty five shillings this afternoon he’ll have the field to himself and he’ll be able to do the pale fragile not long for this world business to perfection after his raspberry trifle experience yes he’ll be _quite_ two pounds ahead of me by now with much probing and plucking and many regretful murmurs the beleaguered ladies managed to produce seven and sixpence between them i am afraid this is all we’ve got said mrs stossen matilda showed no sign of coming down either to the earth or to their figure i could not do violence to my conscience for anything less than ten shillings she announced stiffly mother and daughter muttered certain remarks under their breath in which the word beast was prominent and probably had no reference to tarquin i find i _have_ got another half crown said mrs stossen in a shaking voice here you are now please fetch some one quickly matilda slipped down from the tree took possession of the donation and proceeded to pick up a handful of over ripe medlars from the grass at her feet then she climbed over the gate and addressed herself affectionately to the boar pig come tarquin dear old boy you know you can’t resist medlars when they’re rotten and squashy tarquin couldn’t by dint of throwing the fruit in front of him at judicious intervals matilda decoyed him back to his stye while the delivered captives hurried across the paddock well i never the little minx exclaimed mrs stossen when she was safely on the high road the animal wasn’t savage at all and as for the ten shillings i don’t believe the fresh air fund will see a penny of it there she was unwarrantably harsh in her judgment if you examine the books of the fund you will find the acknowledgment collected by miss matilda cuvering 2s 6d the brogue the hunting season had come to an end and the mullets had not succeeded in selling the brogue there had been a kind of tradition in the family for the past three or four years a sort of fatalistic hope that the brogue would find a purchaser before the hunting was over but seasons came and went without anything happening to justify such ill founded optimism the animal had been named berserker in the earlier stages of its career it had been rechristened the brogue later on in recognition of the fact that once acquired it was extremely difficult to get rid of the unkinder wits of the neighbourhood had been known to suggest that the first letter of its name was superfluous the brogue had been variously described in sale catalogues as a light weight hunter a lady’s hack and more simply but still with a touch of imagination as a useful brown gelding standing 15.1 toby mullet had ridden him for four seasons with the west wessex you can ride almost any sort of horse with the west wessex as long as it is an animal that knows the country the brogue knew the country intimately having personally created most of the gaps that were to be met with in banks and hedges for many miles round his manners and characteristics were not ideal in the hunting field but he was probably rather safer to ride to hounds than he was as a hack on country roads according to the mullet family he was not really road shy but there were one or two objects of dislike that brought on sudden attacks of what toby called the swerving sickness motors and cycles he treated with tolerant disregard but pigs wheelbarrows piles of stones by the roadside perambulators in a village street gates painted too aggressively white and sometimes but not always the newer kind of beehives turned him aside from his tracks in vivid imitation of the zigzag course of forked lightning if a pheasant rose noisily from the other side of a hedgerow the brogue would spring into the air at the same moment but this may have been due to a desire to be companionable the mullet family contradicted the widely prevalent report that the horse was a confirmed crib biter it was about the third week in may that mrs mullet relict of the late sylvester mullet and mother of toby and a bunch of daughters assailed clovis sangrail on the outskirts of the village with a breathless catalogue of local happenings you know our new neighbour mr penricarde she vociferated awfully rich owns tin mines in cornwall middle aged and rather quiet he’s taken the red house on a long lease and spent a lot of money on alterations and improvements well toby’s sold him the brogue clovis spent a moment or two in assimilating the astonishing news then he broke out into unstinted congratulation if he had belonged to a more emotional race he would probably have kissed mrs mullet how wonderfully lucky to have pulled it off at last now you can buy a decent animal i’ve always said that toby was clever ever so many congratulations don’t congratulate me it’s the most unfortunate thing that could have happened said mrs mullet dramatically clovis stared at her in amazement mr penricarde said mrs mullet sinking her voice to what she imagined to be an impressive whisper though it rather resembled a hoarse excited squeak mr penricarde has just begun to pay attentions to jessie slight at first but now unmistakable i was a fool not to have seen it sooner yesterday at the rectory garden party he asked her what her favourite flowers were and she told him carnations and to day a whole stack of carnations has arrived clove and malmaison and lovely dark red ones regular exhibition blooms and a box of chocolates that he must have got on purpose from london and he’s asked her to go round the links with him to morrow and now just at this critical moment toby has sold him that animal it’s a calamity but you’ve been trying to get the horse off your hands for years said clovis i’ve got a houseful of daughters said mrs mullet and i’ve been trying well not to get them off my hands of course but a husband or two wouldn’t be amiss among the lot of them there are six of them you know i don’t know said clovis i’ve never counted but i expect you’re right as to the number mothers generally know these things and now continued mrs mullet in her tragic whisper when there’s a rich husband in prospect imminent on the horizon toby goes and sells him that miserable animal it will probably kill him if he tries to ride it anyway it will kill any affection he might have felt towards any member of our family what is to be done we can’t very well ask to have the horse back you see we praised it up like anything when we thought there was a chance of his buying it and said it was just the animal to suit him couldn’t you steal it out of his stable and send it to grass at some farm miles away suggested clovis write votes for women on the stable door and the thing would pass for a suffragette outrage no one who knew the horse could possibly suspect you of wanting to get it back again every newspaper in the country would ring with the affair said mrs mullet can’t you imagine the headline valuable hunter stolen by suffragettes the police would scour the countryside till they found the animal well jessie must try and get it back from penricarde on the plea that it’s an old favourite she can say it was only sold because the stable had to be pulled down under the terms of an old repairing lease and that now it has been arranged that the stable is to stand for a couple of years longer it sounds a queer proceeding to ask for a horse back when you’ve just sold him said mrs mullet but something must be done and done at once the man is not used to horses and i believe i told him it was as quiet as a lamb after all lambs go kicking and twisting about as if they were demented don’t they the lamb has an entirely unmerited character for sedateness agreed clovis jessie came back from the golf links next day in a state of mingled elation and concern it’s all right about the proposal she announced he came out with it at the sixth hole i said i must have time to think it over i accepted him at the seventh my dear said her mother i think a little more maidenly reserve and hesitation would have been advisable as you’ve known him so short a time you might have waited till the ninth hole the seventh is a very long hole said jessie besides the tension was putting us both off our game by the time we’d got to the ninth hole we’d settled lots of things the honeymoon is to be spent in corsica with perhaps a flying visit to naples if we feel like it and a week in london to wind up with two of his nieces are to be asked to be bridesmaids so with our lot there will be seven which is rather a lucky number you are to wear your pearl grey with any amount of honiton lace jabbed into it by the way he’s coming over this evening to ask your consent to the whole affair so far all’s well but about the brogue it’s a different matter i told him the legend about the stable and how keen we were about buying the horse back but he seems equally keen on keeping it he said he must have horse exercise now that he’s living in the country and he’s going to start riding to morrow he’s ridden a few times in the row on an animal that was accustomed to carry octogenarians and people undergoing rest cures and that’s about all his experience in the saddle oh and he rode a pony once in norfolk when he was fifteen and the pony twenty four and to morrow he’s going to ride the brogue i shall be a widow before i’m married and i do so want to see what corsica’s like it looks so silly on the map clovis was sent for in haste and the developments of the situation put before him nobody can ride that animal with any safety said mrs mullet except toby and he knows by long experience what it is going to shy at and manages to swerve at the same time i did hint to mr penricarde to vincent i should say that the brogue didn’t like white gates said jessie white gates exclaimed mrs mullet did you mention what effect a pig has on him he’ll have to go past lockyer’s farm to get to the high road and there’s sure to be a pig or two grunting about in the lane he’s taken rather a dislike to turkeys lately said toby it’s obvious that penricarde mustn’t be allowed to go out on that animal said clovis at least not till jessie has married him and tired of him i tell you what ask him to a picnic to morrow starting at an early hour he’s not the sort to go out for a ride before breakfast the day after i’ll get the rector to drive him over to crowleigh before lunch to see the new cottage hospital they’re building there the brogue will be standing idle in the stable and toby can offer to exercise it then it can pick up a stone or something of the sort and go conveniently lame if you hurry on the wedding a bit the lameness fiction can be kept up till the ceremony is safely over mrs mullet belonged to an emotional race and she kissed clovis it was nobody’s fault that the rain came down in torrents the next morning making a picnic a fantastic impossibility it was also nobody’s fault but sheer ill luck that the weather cleared up sufficiently in the afternoon to tempt mr penricarde to make his first essay with the brogue they did not get as far as the pigs at lockyer’s farm the rectory gate was painted a dull unobtrusive green but it had been white a year or two ago and the brogue never forgot that he had been in the habit of making a violent curtsey a back pedal and a swerve at this particular point of the road subsequently there being apparently no further call on his services he broke his way into the rectory orchard where he found a hen turkey in a coop later visitors to the orchard found the coop almost intact but very little left of the turkey mr penricarde a little stunned and shaken and suffering from a bruised knee and some minor damages good naturedly ascribed the accident to his own inexperience with horses and country roads and allowed jessie to nurse him back into complete recovery and golf fitness within something less than a week in the list of wedding presents which the local newspaper published a fortnight or so later appeared the following item brown saddle horse the brogue bridegroom’s gift to bride which shows said toby mullet that he knew nothing or else said clovis that he has a very pleasing wit the hen dora bittholz is coming on thursday said mrs sangrail this next thursday asked clovis his mother nodded you’ve rather done it haven’t you he chuckled jane martlet has only been here five days and she never stays less than a fortnight even when she’s asked definitely for a week you’ll never get her out of the house by thursday why should i asked mrs sangrail she and dora are good friends aren’t they they used to be as far as i remember they used to be that’s what makes them all the more bitter now each feels that she has nursed a viper in her bosom nothing fans the flame of human resentment so much as the discovery that one’s bosom has been utilised as a snake sanatorium but what has happened has some one been making mischief not exactly said clovis a hen came between them a hen what hen it was a bronze leghorn or some such exotic breed and dora sold it to jane at a rather exotic price they both go in for prize poultry you know and jane thought she was going to get her money back in a large family of pedigree chickens the bird turned out to be an abstainer from the egg habit and i’m told that the letters which passed between the two women were a revelation as to how much invective could be got on to a sheet of notepaper how ridiculous said mrs sangrail couldn’t some of their friends compose the quarrel people tried said clovis but it must have been rather like composing the storm music of the fliegende holländer jane was willing to take back some of her most libellous remarks if dora would take back the hen but dora said that would be owning herself in the wrong and you know she’d as soon think of owning slum property in whitechapel as do that it’s a most awkward situation said mrs sangrail do you suppose they won’t speak to one another on the contrary the difficulty will be to get them to leave off their remarks on each other’s conduct and character have hitherto been governed by the fact that only four ounces of plain speaking can be sent through the post for a penny i can’t put dora off said mrs sangrail i’ve already postponed her visit once and nothing short of a miracle would make jane leave before her self allotted fortnight is over miracles are rather in my line said clovis i don’t pretend to be very hopeful in this case but i’ll do my best as long as you don’t drag me into it stipulated his mother servants are a bit of a nuisance muttered clovis as he sat in the smoking room after lunch talking fitfully to jane martlet in the intervals of putting together the materials of a cocktail which he had irreverently patented under the name of an ella wheeler wilcox it was partly compounded of old brandy and partly of curaçoa there were other ingredients but they were never indiscriminately revealed servants a nuisance exclaimed jane bounding into the topic with the exuberant plunge of a hunter when it leaves the high road and feels turf under its hoofs i should think they were the trouble i’ve had in getting suited this year you would hardly believe but i don’t see what you have to complain of your mother is so wonderfully lucky in her servants sturridge for instance he’s been with you for years and i’m sure he’s a paragon as butlers go that’s just the trouble said clovis it’s when servants have been with you for years that they become a really serious nuisance the here to day and gone to morrow sort don’t matter you’ve simply got to replace them it’s the stayers and the paragons that are the real worry but if they give satisfaction that doesn’t prevent them from giving trouble now you’ve mentioned sturridge it was sturridge i was particularly thinking of when i made the observation about servants being a nuisance the excellent sturridge a nuisance i can’t believe it i know he’s excellent and we just couldn’t get along without him he’s the one reliable element in this rather haphazard household but his very orderliness has had an effect on him have you ever considered what it must be like to go on unceasingly doing the correct thing in the correct manner in the same surroundings for the greater part of a lifetime to know and ordain and superintend exactly what silver and glass and table linen shall be used and set out on what occasions to have cellar and pantry and plate cupboard under a minutely devised and undeviating administration to be noiseless impalpable omnipresent and as far as your own department is concerned omniscient i should go mad said jane with conviction exactly said clovis thoughtfully swallowing his completed ella wheeler wilcox but sturridge hasn’t gone mad said jane with a flutter of inquiry in her voice on most points he’s thoroughly sane and reliable said clovis but at times he is subject to the most obstinate delusions and on those occasions he becomes not merely a nuisance but a decided embarrassment what sort of delusions unfortunately they usually centre round one of the guests of the house party and that is where the awkwardness comes in for instance he took it into his head that matilda sheringham was the prophet elijah and as all that he remembered about elijah’s history was the episode of the ravens in the wilderness he absolutely declined to interfere with what he imagined to be matilda’s private catering arrangements wouldn’t allow any tea to be sent up to her in the morning and if he was waiting at table he passed her over altogether in handing round the dishes how very unpleasant whatever did you do about it oh matilda got fed after a fashion but it was judged to be best for her to cut her visit short it was really the only thing to be done said clovis with some emphasis i shouldn’t have done that said jane i should have humoured him in some way i certainly shouldn’t have gone away clovis frowned it is not always wise to humour people when they get these ideas into their heads there’s no knowing to what lengths they may go if you encourage them you don’t mean to say he might be dangerous do you asked jane with some anxiety one can never be certain said clovis now and then he gets some idea about a guest which might take an unfortunate turn that is precisely what is worrying me at the present moment what has he taken a fancy about some one here now asked jane excitedly how thrilling do tell me who it is you said clovis briefly me clovis nodded who on earth does he think i am queen anne was the unexpected answer queen anne what an idea but anyhow there’s nothing dangerous about her she’s such a colourless personality what does posterity chiefly say about queen anne asked clovis rather sternly the only thing that i can remember about her said jane is the saying queen anne’s dead exactly said clovis staring at the glass that had held the ella wheeler wilcox dead do you mean he takes me for the ghost of queen anne asked jane ghost dear no no one ever heard of a ghost that came down to breakfast and ate kidneys and toast and honey with a healthy appetite no it’s the fact of you being so very much alive and flourishing that perplexes and annoys him all his life he has been accustomed to look on queen anne as the personification of everything that is dead and done with as dead as queen anne you know and now he has to fill your glass at lunch and dinner and listen to your accounts of the gay time you had at the dublin horse show and naturally he feels that something’s very wrong with you but he wouldn’t be downright hostile to me on that account would he jane asked anxiously i didn’t get really alarmed about it till lunch to day said clovis i caught him glowering at you with a very sinister look and muttering ought to be dead long ago she ought and some one should see to it that’s why i mentioned the matter to you this is awful said jane your mother must be told about it at once my mother mustn’t hear a word about it said clovis earnestly it would upset her dreadfully she relies on sturridge for everything but he might kill me at any moment protested jane not at any moment he’s busy with the silver all the afternoon you’ll have to keep a sharp look out all the time and be on your guard to frustrate any murderous attack said jane adding in a tone of weak obstinacy it’s a dreadful situation to be in with a mad butler dangling over you like the sword of what’s his name but i’m certainly not going to cut my visit short clovis swore horribly under his breath the miracle was an obvious misfire it was in the hall the next morning after a late breakfast that clovis had his final inspiration as he stood engaged in coaxing rust spots from an old putter where is miss martlet he asked the butler who was at that moment crossing the hall writing letters in the morning room sir said sturridge announcing a fact of which his questioner was already aware she wants to copy the inscription on that old basket hilted sabre said clovis pointing to a venerable weapon hanging on the wall i wish you’d take it to her my hands are all over oil take it without the sheath it will be less trouble the butler drew the blade still keen and bright in its well cared for old age and carried it into the morning room there was a door near the writing table leading to a back stairway jane vanished through it with such lightning rapidity that the butler doubted whether she had seen him come in half an hour later clovis was driving her and her hastily packed luggage to the station mother will be awfully vexed when she comes back from her ride and finds you have gone he observed to the departing guest but i’ll make up some story about an urgent wire having called you away it wouldn’t do to alarm her unnecessarily about sturridge jane sniffed slightly at clovis ideas of unnecessary alarm and was almost rude to the young man who came round with thoughtful inquiries as to luncheon baskets the miracle lost some of its usefulness from the fact that dora wrote the same day postponing the date of her visit but at any rate clovis holds the record as the only human being who ever hustled jane martlet out of the time table of her migrations the open window my aunt will be down presently mr nuttel said a very self possessed young lady of fifteen in the meantime you must try and put up with me framton nuttel endeavoured to say the correct something which should duly flatter the niece of the moment without unduly discounting the aunt that was to come privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing i know how it will be his sister had said when he was preparing to migrate to this rural retreat you will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul and your nerves will be worse than ever from moping i shall just give you letters of introduction to all the people i know there some of them as far as i can remember were quite nice framton wondered whether mrs sappleton the lady to whom he was presenting one of the letters of introduction came into the nice division do you know many of the people round here asked the niece when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion hardly a soul said framton my sister was staying here at the rectory you know some four years ago and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here he made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret then you know practically nothing about my aunt pursued the self possessed young lady only her name and address admitted the caller he was wondering whether mrs sappleton was in the married or widowed state an undefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation her great tragedy happened just three years ago said the child that would be since your sister’s time her tragedy asked framton somehow in this restful country spot tragedies seemed out of place you may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an october afternoon said the niece indicating a large french window that opened on to a lawn it is quite warm for the time of the year said framton but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy out through that window three years ago to a day her husband and her two young brothers"
