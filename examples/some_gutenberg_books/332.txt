"1" "in the summer as it happened a young soldier one of her cousins she had no end of cousins had got a leave of absence and had come there sick with fever just the day before the house was always a sort of hospital he was in the boys room in bed when the yankees arrived and they were all around the house before she knew it she went downstairs to meet them they had been informed by one of the negroes that cousin charlie was there and they told her that they wanted him she told them they could not get him they asked her why is he not there i heard her tell of it once she said you know i thought when i told them they could not get him that they would go away but when they asked me if he was not there of course i could not tell them a story so i said i declined to answer impertinent questions you know poor charlie was at that moment lying curled up under the bed in the boys room with a roll of carpet a foot thick around him and it was as hot as an oven well they insisted on going through the house and i let them go all through the lower stories but when they started up the staircase i was ready for them i had always kept you know one of papa's old horse pistols as a protection of course it was not loaded i would not have had it loaded for anything in the world i always kept it safely locked up and i was dreadfully afraid of it even then but you have no idea what a moral support it gave me and i used to unlock the drawer every afternoon to see if it was still there all right and then lock it again and put the key away carefully well as it happened i had just been looking at it which i called inspecting my garrison i used to feel just like lady margaret in tillietudlam castle well i had just been looking at it that afternoon when i heard the yankees were coming and by a sudden inspiration i cannot tell for my life how i did it i seized the pistol and hid it under my apron i held on to it with both hands i was so afraid of it and all the time those wretches were going through the rooms down stairs i was quaking with terror but when they started up the stairs i had a new feeling i knew they were bound to get poor charlie if he had not melted and run away no he would never have run away i mean evaporated and i suddenly ran up the stairway a few steps before them and hauling out my big pistol pointed it at them and told them that if they came one step higher i would certainly pull the trigger i could not say i would shoot for it was not loaded well do you know they stopped they stopped dead still i declare i was so afraid the old pistol would go off though of course i knew it was not loaded that i was just quaking but as soon as they stopped i began to attack i remembered my old grandmother and her scissors and like general jackson i followed up my advantage i descended the steps brandishing my pistol with both hands and abusing them with all my might i was so afraid they might ask if it was loaded but they really thought i would shoot them you know men have not liked to be slain by a woman since the time of abimelech and they actually ran down the steps with me after them and i got them all out of the house then i locked the door and barred it and ran up stairs and had such a cry over charlie that was like an old maid afterwards they were going to burn the house but i got hold of their colonel who was not there at first and made him really ashamed of himself for i told him we were nothing but a lot of poor defenceless women and a sick boy he said he thought i was right well defended as i had held a company at bay he finally promised that if i would give him some music he would not go up stairs so i paid that for my ransom and a bitter ransom it was too i can tell you singing for a yankee but i gave him a dose of confederate songs i promise you he asked me to sing the star spangled banner but i told him i would not do it if he burnt the house down with me in it though it was inspired by my cousin armistead then he asked me to sing home sweet home and i did that and he actually had tears in his eyes the hypocrite he had very fine eyes too i think i did sing it well though i cried a little myself thinking of the old house being so nearly burnt there was a young doctor there a surgeon a really nice looking fellow for a yankee i made him feel ashamed of himself i tell you i told him i had no doubt he had a good mother and sister up at home and to think of his coming and warring on poor women and they really placed a guard over the house for me while they were there this she actually did with her old empty horse pistol she cleared the house of the mob and then vowed that if they burned the house she would burn up in it and finally saved it by singing home sweet home for the colonel she could not have done much better even if she had not been an old maid i did not see much of her after i grew up i moved away from the old county most others did the same it had been desolated by the war and got poorer and poorer with an old maid's usual crankiness and inability to adapt herself to the order of things cousin fanny remained behind she refused to come away said i believe she had to look after the old place mammy and fash or some such nonsense i think she had some idea that the church would go down or that the poor people around would miss her or something equally unpractical anyhow she stayed behind and lived for quite awhile the last of her connection in the county of course all did the best they could for her and had she gone to live around with her relatives as they wished her to do they would have borne with her and supported her but she said no that a single woman ought never to live in any house but her father's or her own and we could not do anything with her she was so proud she would not take money as a gift from anyone not even from her nearest relatives her health got rather poor not unnaturally considering the way she divided her time between doctoring herself and fussing after sick people in all sorts of weather with the fancifulness of her kind she finally took it into her head that she must consult a doctor in new york of course no one but an old maid would have done this the home doctors were good enough for everyone else nothing would do however but she must go to new york so against the advice of everyone she wrote to a cousin who was living there to meet her and with her old wraps and cap and bags and bundles and stick and umbrella she started the lady met her that is went to meet her but failed to find her at the station and supposing that she had not come or had taken some other railroad which she was likely to do returned home to find her in bed with her things piled up on the floor some gentleman had come across her in washington holding the right train while she insisted on taking the wrong route and had taken compassion on her and not only escorted her to new york but had taken her and all her parcels and brought her to her destination where she had at once retired he was a most charming man my dear she said to her cousin who told me of it afterward in narrating her eccentricities and to think of it i don't believe i had looked in a glass all day and when i got here my cap had somehow got twisted around and was perched right over my left ear making me look a perfect fright he told me his name but i have forgotten it of course but he was such a gentleman and to think of his being a yankee i told him i hated all yankees and he just laughed and did not mind my stick nor old umbrella nor bundles a bit you'd have thought my old cap was a parisian bonnet i will not believe he was a yankee well she went to see the doctor the most celebrated in new york at the infirmary of course for she was too poor to go to his office one consultation would have taken every cent she had her cousin went with her and told me of it she said that when she came downstairs to go she never saw such a sight on her head she had her blue cap and her green shade and her veil and her shawl and she had the old umbrella and long stick which she had brought from the country and a large pillow under her arm because she knew she was going to faint so they started out but it was a slow procession the noise and bustle of the street dazed her her cousin fancied and every now and then she would clutch her companion and declare she must go back or she should faint at every street crossing she insisted upon having a policeman to help her over or in default of that she would stop some man and ask him to escort her across which of course he would do thinking her crazy finally they reached the infirmary where there were already a large number of patients and many more came in afterwards here she shortly established an acquaintance with several strangers she had to wait an hour or more for her turn and then insisted that several who had come in after her should go in before her because she said the poor things looked so tired this would have gone on indefinitely her cousin said if she had not finally dragged her into the doctor's room there the first thing that she did was to insist that she must lie down she was so faint and her pillow was brought into requisition the doctor humored her and waited on her her friend started to tell him about her but the doctor said i prefer to have her tell me herself she presently began to tell the doctor sitting quietly by listening and seeming to be much interested he gave her some prescription and told her to come again next day and when she went he sent for her ahead of her turn and after that made her come to his office at his private house instead of to the infirmary as at first he turned out to be the surgeon who had been at her house with the yankees during the war he was very kind to her i suppose he had never seen anyone like her she used to go every day and soon dispensed with her friend's escort finding no difficulty in getting about indeed she came to be known on the streets she passed through and on the cars she travelled by and people guided her several times as she was taking the wrong car men stopped her and said to her madam yours is the red car she said sure enough it was but she never could divine how they knew she addressed the conductors as my dear sir and made them help her not only off but quite to the sidewalk when she thanked them and said good by as if she had been at home she said she did this on principle for it was such a good thing to teach them to help a feeble woman next time they would expect to do it and after a while it would become a habit she said no one knew what terror women had of being run over and trampled on she was as i have said an awful coward she used to stand still on the edge of the street and look up and down both ways ever so long then go out in the street and stand still look both ways and then run back or as like as not start on and turn and run back after she was more than half way across and so get into real danger one day as she was passing along a driver had in his cart an old bag of bones of a horse which he was beating to make him pull up the hill and cousin fanny with an old maid's meddlesomeness pushed out into the street and caught hold of him and made him stop which of course collected a crowd and just as she was coming back a little cart came rattling along and though she was in no earthly danger she ran so to get out of the way of the horse that she tripped and fell down in the street and hurt herself so much for cowardice the doctor finally told her that she had nothing the matter with her except something with her nerves and i believe her spine and that she wanted company you see she was a good deal alone he said it was the first law of health ever laid down that it was not good for man to be alone that loneliness is a specific disease he said she wanted occupation some sort of work to interest her and make her forget her aches and ailments he suggested missionary work of some kind this was one of the worst things he could have told her for there was no missionary work to be had where she lived besides she could not have done missionary work she had never done anything in her life she was always wasting her time pottering about the country on her old horse seeing sick old darkies or poor people in the pines no matter how bad the weather was nor how deep the roads she would go prowling around to see some old aunty or uncle in their out of the way cabins or somebody's sick child i have met her on old fashion in the rain toiling along in roads that were knee deep to get the doctor to come to see some sick person or to get a dose of physic from the depot how could she have done any missionary work i believe she repaid the doctor for his care of her by sending him a charity patient to look after scroggs's eldest girl who was bedridden or something cousin fanny had a fancy that she was musical i never knew how it was arranged i think the doctor sent the money down to have the child brought on to new york for him to see i suppose cousin fanny turned beggar and asked him i know she told him the child was the daughter of a friend of hers a curious sort of friend scroggs was a drunken creature who had done everything he could to pain her and she took a great deal of trouble to get her to the train lending old fashion to haul her which was a great deal more than lending herself and the doctor treated her in new york for three months without any charge till i believe the child got better old maids do not mind giving people trouble she hung on at the old place as long as she could but it had to be sold and finally she had to leave it though i believe even after it was sold she tried boarding for a while with scroggs the former tenant who had bought it he treated her so badly that finally she had to leave and boarded around i believe the real cause was she caught him ploughing with old fashion after that i do not know exactly what she did i heard that though the parish was vacant she had a sunday school at the old church and so kept the church open and that she used to play the wheezy old organ and teach the poor children the chants but as they grew up they all joined another church they had a new organ there i do not know just how she got on i was surprised to hear finally that she was dead had been dead since christmas it had never occurred to me that she would die she had been dying so long that i had almost come to regard her as immortal and as a necessary part of the old county and its associations i fell in some time afterwards with a young doctor from the old county who i found had attended her and i made some inquiries about her he told me that she died christmas night she came to his house on her old mare in the rain and snow the night before to get him to go to see someone some friend of hers who was sick he said she had more sick friends than anyone he ever knew he told her that he was sick himself and could not go but she was so importunate that he promised to go next morning she was always very worrying he said she was wet and shivering then she never had any idea about really protecting herself and that she appeared to have a wretched cold she had been riding all day seeing about a christmas tree for the poor children he urged her to stop and spend the night but she insisted that she must go on though it was nearly dark and raining hard and the roads would have mired a cat she was always self willed next day he went to see the sick woman and when he arrived he found her in one bed and cousin fanny in another in the same room when he had examined the patient he turned and asked cousin fanny what was the matter with her oh just a little cold a little trouble in the chest as theodore hook said she replied but i know how to doctor myself something about her voice struck him he went over to her and looked at her and found her suffering from acute pneumonia he at once set to work on her he took the other patient up in his arms and carried her into another room where he told her that cousin fanny was a desperately ill woman she was actually dying then sir he said to me and she died that night when she arrived at the place the night before which was not until after nine o'clock she had gone to the stable herself to put up her old mare or rather to see that she was fed she always did that so when she got into the house she was wet and chilled through and she had to go to bed she must have had on wet clothes he said i asked him if she knew she was going to die he said he did not think she did that he did not tell her and she talked about nothing except her christmas tree and the people she wanted to see he heard her praying in the night and by the way he said she mentioned you she shortly became rather delirious and wandered a good deal talking of things that must have happened when she was young spoke of going to see her mother somewhere the last thing she ever said was something about fashion which he said showed how ingrained is vanity in the female mind the doctor knows something of human nature he concluded what he had to say with she was in some respects a very remarkable woman if she had not been an old maid i do not suppose that she ever drew a well breath in her life not that i think old maids cannot be very acceptable women he apologized they are sometimes very useful the doctor was a rather enlightened man some of her relatives got there in time for the funeral and a good many of the poor people came and she was carried in a little old spring wagon drawn by fashion through the snow to the old home place where scroggs very kindly let them dig the grave and was buried there in the old graveyard in the garden in a vacant space just beside her mother with the children around her i really miss her a great deal the other boys say they do the same i suppose it is the trouble she used to give us the old set are all doing well doug is a professor he says the word spinster gave him a twist to philology old blinky is in paris he had a picture in the salon last year an autumn landscape called le cote du bois i believe the translation of that is the woodside his coloring is said to be nature itself to think of old blinky being a great artist little kitty is now a big girl and is doing finely at school i have told her she must not be an old maid joe is a preacher with a church in the purlieus of a large city i was there not long ago he had a choral service the gregorian music carried me back to old times he preached on the text i was sick and ye visited me it was such a fine sermon and he had such a large congregation that i asked why he did not go to a finer church he said he was carrying soup to mrs ronquist by the way his organist was a splendid musician she introduced herself to me it was scroggs's daughter she is married and can walk as well as i can she had a little girl with her that i think she called fanny i do not think that was mrs scroggs's name frank is now a doctor or rather a surgeon in the same city with joe and becoming very distinguished the other day he performed a great operation saving a woman's life which was in all the papers he said to an interviewer that he became a surgeon from dressing a sore on an old mare's back i wonder what he was talking about he is about to start a woman's hospital for poor women cousin fanny would have been glad of that she was always proud of frank she would as likely as not have quoted that verse from tennyson's song about the echoes she sleeps now under the myrtle at scroggs's i have often thought of what that doctor said about her that she would have been a very remarkable woman if she had not been an old maid i mean a spinster the burial of the guns lee surrendered the remnant of his army at appomattox april 9 1865 and yet a couple of days later the old colonel's battery lay intrenched right in the mountain pass where it had halted three days before two weeks previously it had been detailed with a light division sent to meet and repel a force which it was understood was coming in by way of the southwest valley to strike lee in the rear of his long line from richmond to petersburg it had done its work the mountain pass had been seized and held and the federal force had not gotten by that road within the blue rampart which guarded on that side the heart of virginia this pass which was the key to the main line of passage over the mountains had been assigned by the commander of the division to the old colonel and his old battery and they had held it the position taken by the battery had been chosen with a soldier's eye a better place could not have been selected to hold the pass it was its highest point just where the road crawled over the shoulder of the mountain along the limestone cliff a hundred feet sheer above the deep river where its waters had cut their way in ages past and now lay deep and silent as if resting after their arduous toil before they began to boil over the great bowlders which filled the bed a hundred or more yards below the little plateau at the top guarded the descending road on either side for nearly a mile and the mountain on the other side of the river was the centre of a clump of rocky heavily timbered spurs so inaccessible that no feet but those of wild animals or of the hardiest hunter had ever climbed it on the side of the river on which the road lay the only path out over the mountain except the road itself was a charcoal burner's track dwindling at times to a footway known only to the mountain folk which a picket at the top could hold against an army the position well defended was impregnable and it was well defended this the general of the division knew when he detailed the old colonel and gave him his order to hold the pass until relieved and not let his guns fall into the hands of the enemy he knew both the colonel and his battery the battery was one of the oldest in the army it had been in the service since april 1861 and its commander had come to be known as the wheel horse of his division he was perhaps the oldest officer of his rank in his branch of the service although he had bitterly opposed secession and was many years past the age of service when the war came on yet as soon as the president called on the state for her quota of troops to coerce south carolina he had raised and uniformed an artillery company and offered it not to the president of the united states but to the governor of virginia it is just at this point that he suddenly looms up to me as a soldier the relation he never wholly lost to me afterward though i knew him for many many years of peace his gray coat with the red facing and the bars on the collar his military cap his gray flannel shirt it was the first time i ever saw him wear anything but immaculate linen his high boots his horse caparisoned with a black high peaked saddle with crupper and breast girth instead of the light english hunting saddle to which i had been accustomed all come before me now as if it were but the other day i remember but little beyond it yet i remember as if it were yesterday his leaving home and the scenes which immediately preceded it the excitement created by the news of the president's call for troops the unanimous judgment that it meant war the immediate determination of the old colonel who had hitherto opposed secession that it must be met the suppressed agitation on the plantation attendant upon the tender of his services and the governor's acceptance of them the prompt and continuous work incident to the enlistment of the men the bustle of preparation and all the scenes of that time come before me now it turned the calm current of the life of an old and placid country neighborhood far from any city or centre and stirred it into a boiling torrent strong enough or fierce enough to cut its way and join the general torrent which was bearing down and sweeping everything before it it seemed but a minute before the quiet old plantation in which the harvest the corn shucking and the christmas holidays alone marked the passage of the quiet seasons and where a strange carriage or a single horseman coming down the big road was an event in life was turned into a depot of war supplies and the neighborhood became a parade ground the old colonel not a colonel yet nor even a captain except by brevet was on his horse by daybreak and off on his rounds through the plantations and the pines enlisting his company the office in the yard heretofore one in name only became one now in reality and a table was set out piled with papers pens ink books of tactics and regulation at which men were accepted and enrolled soldiers seemed to spring from the ground as they did from the sowing of the dragon's teeth in the days of cadmus men came up the high road or down the paths across the fields sometimes singly but oftener in little parties of two or three and asking for the captain entered the office as private citizens and came out soldiers enlisted for the war there was nothing heard of on the"
