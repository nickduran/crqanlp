a hard one he endeavoured to make peace with miss jenkyns soon after the memorable dispute i have named by a present of a wooden fire shovel his own making having heard her say how much the grating of an iron one annoyed her she received the present with cool gratitude and thanked him formally when he was gone she bade me put it away in the lumber room feeling probably that no present from a man who preferred mr boz to dr johnson could be less jarring than an iron fire shovel such was the state of things when i left cranford and went to drumble i had however several correspondents who kept me _au fait_ as to the proceedings of the dear little town there was miss pole who was becoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting and the burden of whose letter was something like but don’t you forget the white worsted at flint’s of the old song for at the end of every sentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission which i was to execute for her miss matilda jenkyns who did not mind being called miss matty when miss jenkyns was not by wrote nice kind rambling letters now and then venturing into an opinion of her own but suddenly pulling herself up and either begging me not to name what she had said as deborah thought differently and _she_ knew or else putting in a postscript to the effect that since writing the above she had been talking over the subject with deborah and was quite convinced that etc here probably followed a recantation of every opinion she had given in the letter then came miss jenkyns deborah as she liked miss matty to call her her father having once said that the hebrew name ought to be so pronounced i secretly think she took the hebrew prophetess for a model in character and indeed she was not unlike the stern prophetess in some ways making allowance of course for modern customs and difference in dress miss jenkyns wore a cravat and a little bonnet like a jockey cap and altogether had the appearance of a strong minded woman although she would have despised the modern idea of women being equal to men equal indeed she knew they were superior but to return to her letters everything in them was stately and grand like herself i have been looking them over dear miss jenkyns how i honoured her and i will give an extract more especially because it relates to our friend captain brown the honourable mrs jamieson has only just quitted me and in the course of conversation she communicated to me the intelligence that she had yesterday received a call from her revered husband’s quondam friend lord mauleverer you will not easily conjecture what brought his lordship within the precincts of our little town it was to see captain brown with whom it appears his lordship was acquainted in the plumed wars and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his lordship’s head when some great peril was impending over it off the misnomered cape of good hope you know our friend the honourable mrs jamieson’s deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity and you will therefore not be so much surprised when i tell you she was quite unable to disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question i was anxious i confess to ascertain in what manner captain brown with his limited establishment could receive so distinguished a guest and i discovered that his lordship retired to rest and let us hope to refreshing slumbers at the angel hotel but shared the brunonian meals during the two days that he honoured cranford with his august presence mrs johnson our civil butcher’s wife informs me that miss jessie purchased a leg of lamb but besides this i can hear of no preparation whatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor perhaps they entertained him with the feast of reason and the flow of soul and to us who are acquainted with captain brown’s sad want of relish for the pure wells of english undefiled it may be matter for congratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by holding converse with an elegant and refined member of the british aristocracy but from some mundane failings who is altogether free miss pole and miss matty wrote to me by the same post such a piece of news as lord mauleverer’s visit was not to be lost on the cranford letter writers they made the most of it miss matty humbly apologised for writing at the same time as her sister who was so much more capable than she to describe the honour done to cranford but in spite of a little bad spelling miss matty’s account gave me the best idea of the commotion occasioned by his lordship’s visit after it had occurred for except the people at the angel the browns mrs jamieson and a little lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against the aristocratic legs i could not hear of any one with whom his lordship had held conversation my next visit to cranford was in the summer there had been neither births deaths nor marriages since i was there last everybody lived in the same house and wore pretty nearly the same well preserved old fashioned clothes the greatest event was that miss jenkyns had purchased a new carpet for the drawing room oh the busy work miss matty and i had in chasing the sunbeams as they fell in an afternoon right down on this carpet through the blindless window we spread newspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work and lo in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved and was blazing away on a fresh spot and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of the newspapers we were very busy too one whole morning before miss jenkyns gave her party in following her directions and in cutting out and stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to every chair set for the expected visitors lest their shoes might dirty or defile the purity of the carpet do you make paper paths for every guest to walk upon in london captain brown and miss jenkyns were not very cordial to each other the literary dispute of which i had seen the beginning was a raw the slightest touch on which made them wince it was the only difference of opinion they had ever had but that difference was enough miss jenkyns could not refrain from talking at captain brown and though he did not reply he drummed with his fingers which action she felt and resented as very disparaging to dr johnson he was rather ostentatious in his preference of the writings of mr boz would walk through the streets so absorbed in them that he all but ran against miss jenkyns and though his apologies were earnest and sincere and though he did not in fact do more than startle her and himself she owned to me she had rather he had knocked her down if he had only been reading a higher style of literature the poor brave captain he looked older and more worn and his clothes were very threadbare but he seemed as bright and cheerful as ever unless he was asked about his daughter’s health she suffers a great deal and she must suffer more we do what we can to alleviate her pain god’s will be done he took off his hat at these last words i found from miss matty that everything had been done in fact a medical man of high repute in that country neighbourhood had been sent for and every injunction he had given was attended to regardless of expense miss matty was sure they denied themselves many things in order to make the invalid comfortable but they never spoke about it and as for miss jessie i really think she’s an angel said poor miss matty quite overcome to see her way of bearing with miss brown’s crossness and the bright face she puts on after she’s been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it is quite beautiful yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the captain at breakfast time as if she had been asleep in the queen’s bed all night my dear you could never laugh at her prim little curls or her pink bows again if you saw her as i have done i could only feel very penitent and greet miss jessie with double respect when i met her next she looked faded and pinched and her lips began to quiver as if she was very weak when she spoke of her sister but she brightened and sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes as she said but to be sure what a town cranford is for kindness i don’t suppose any one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all comes in a little covered basin for my sister the poor people will leave their earliest vegetables at our door for her they speak short and gruff as if they were ashamed of it but i am sure it often goes to my heart to see their thoughtfulness the tears now came back and overflowed but after a minute or two she began to scold herself and ended by going away the same cheerful miss jessie as ever but why does not this lord mauleverer do something for the man who saved his life said i why you see unless captain brown has some reason for it he never speaks about being poor and he walked along by his lordship looking as happy and cheerful as a prince and as they never called attention to their dinner by apologies and as miss brown was better that day and all seemed bright i daresay his lordship never knew how much care there was in the background he did send game in the winter pretty often but now he is gone abroad i had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and small opportunities in cranford the rose leaves that were gathered ere they fell to make into a potpourri for someone who had no garden the little bundles of lavender flowers sent to strew the drawers of some town dweller or to burn in the chamber of some invalid things that many would despise and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to perform were all attended to in cranford miss jenkyns stuck an apple full of cloves to be heated and smell pleasantly in miss brown’s room and as she put in each clove she uttered a johnsonian sentence indeed she never could think of the browns without talking johnson and as they were seldom absent from her thoughts just then i heard many a rolling three piled sentence captain brown called one day to thank miss jenkyns for many little kindnesses which i did not know until then that she had rendered he had suddenly become like an old man his deep bass voice had a quavering in it his eyes looked dim and the lines on his face were deep he did not could not speak cheerfully of his daughter’s state but he talked with manly pious resignation and not much twice over he said what jessie has been to us god only knows and after the second time he got up hastily shook hands all round without speaking and left the room that afternoon we perceived little groups in the street all listening with faces aghast to some tale or other miss jenkyns wondered what could be the matter for some time before she took the undignified step of sending jenny out to inquire jenny came back with a white face of terror oh ma’am oh miss jenkyns ma’am captain brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads and she burst into tears she along with many others had experienced the poor captain’s kindness how where where good god jenny don’t waste time in crying but tell us something miss matty rushed out into the street at once and collared the man who was telling the tale picture she brought the affrighted carter into the drawing room come in come to my sister at once miss jenkyns the rector’s daughter oh man man say it is not true she cried as she brought the affrighted carter sleeking down his hair into the drawing room where he stood with his wet boots on the new carpet and no one regarded it please mum it is true i seed it myself and he shuddered at the recollection the captain was a reading some new book as he was deep in a waiting for the down train and there was a little lass as wanted to come to its mammy and gave its sister the slip and came toddling across the line and he looked up sudden at the sound of the train coming and seed the child and he darted on the line and cotched it up and his foot slipped and the train came over him in no time o lord lord mum it’s quite true and they’ve come over to tell his daughters the child’s safe though with only a bang on its shoulder as he threw it to its mammy poor captain would be glad of that mum wouldn’t he god bless him the great rough carter puckered up his manly face and turned away to hide his tears i turned to miss jenkyns she looked very ill as if she were going to faint and signed to me to open the window matilda bring me my bonnet i must go to those girls god pardon me if ever i have spoken contemptuously to the captain miss jenkyns arrayed herself to go out telling miss matilda to give the man a glass of wine while she was away miss matty and i huddled over the fire talking in a low and awe struck voice i know we cried quietly all the time miss jenkyns came home in a silent mood and we durst not ask her many questions she told us that miss jessie had fainted and that she and miss pole had had some difficulty in bringing her round but that as soon as she recovered she begged one of them to go and sit with her sister mr hoggins says she cannot live many days and she shall be spared this shock said miss jessie shivering with feelings to which she dared not give way but how can you manage my dear asked miss jenkyns you cannot bear up she must see your tears god will help me i will not give way she was asleep when the news came she may be asleep yet she would be so utterly miserable not merely at my father’s death but to think of what would become of me she is so good to me she looked up earnestly in their faces with her soft true eyes and miss pole told miss jenkyns afterwards she could hardly bear it knowing as she did how miss brown treated her sister however it was settled according to miss jessie’s wish miss brown was to be told her father had been summoned to take a short journey on railway business they had managed it in some way miss jenkyns could not exactly say how miss pole was to stop with miss jessie mrs jamieson had sent to inquire and this was all we heard that night and a sorrowful night it was the next day a full account of the fatal accident was in the county paper which miss jenkyns took in her eyes were very weak she said and she asked me to read it when i came to the gallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a number of pickwick which he had just received miss jenkyns shook her head long and solemnly and then sighed out poor dear infatuated man the corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church there to be interred miss jessie had set her heart on following it to the grave and no dissuasives could alter her resolve her restraint upon herself made her almost obstinate she resisted all miss pole’s entreaties and miss jenkyns advice at last miss jenkyns gave up the point and after a silence which i feared portended some deep displeasure against miss jessie miss jenkyns said she should accompany the latter to the funeral it is not fit for you to go alone it would be against both propriety and humanity were i to allow it miss jessie seemed as if she did not half like this arrangement but her obstinacy if she had any had been exhausted in her determination to go to the interment she longed poor thing i have no doubt to cry alone over the grave of the dear father to whom she had been all in all and to give way for one little half hour uninterrupted by sympathy and unobserved by friendship but it was not to be that afternoon miss jenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape and employed herself busily in trimming the little black silk bonnet i have spoken about when it was finished she put it on and looked at us for approbation admiration she despised i was full of sorrow but by one of those whimsical thoughts which come unbidden into our heads in times of deepest grief i no sooner saw the bonnet than i was reminded of a helmet and in that hybrid bonnet half helmet half jockey cap did miss jenkyns attend captain brown’s funeral and i believe supported miss jessie with a tender indulgent firmness which was invaluable allowing her to weep her passionate fill before they left miss pole miss matty and i meanwhile attended to miss brown and hard work we found it to relieve her querulous and never ending complaints but if we were so weary and dispirited what must miss jessie have been yet she came back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength she put off her mourning dress and came in looking pale and gentle thanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand she could even smile a faint sweet wintry smile as if to reassure us of her power to endure but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears more than if she had cried outright it was settled that miss pole was to remain with her all the watching livelong night and that miss matty and i were to return in the morning to relieve them and give miss jessie the opportunity for a few hours of sleep but when the morning came miss jenkyns appeared at the breakfast table equipped in her helmet bonnet and ordered miss matty to stay at home as she meant to go and help to nurse she was evidently in a state of great friendly excitement which she showed by eating her breakfast standing and scolding the household all round no nursing no energetic strong minded woman could help miss brown now there was that in the room as we entered which was stronger than us all and made us shrink into solemn awestruck helplessness miss brown was dying we hardly knew her voice it was so devoid of the complaining tone we had always associated with it miss jessie told me afterwards that it and her face too were just what they had been formerly when her mother’s death left her the young anxious head of the family of whom only miss jessie survived she was conscious of her sister’s presence though not i think of ours we stood a little behind the curtain miss jessie knelt with her face near her sister’s in order to catch the last soft awful whispers oh jessie jessie how selfish i have been god forgive me for letting you sacrifice yourself for me as you did i have so loved you and yet i have thought only of myself god forgive me hush love hush said miss jessie sobbing and my father my dear dear father i will not complain now if god will give me strength to be patient but oh jessie tell my father how i longed and yearned to see him at last and to ask his forgiveness he can never know now how i loved him oh if i might but tell him before i die what a life of sorrow his has been and i have done so little to cheer him a light came into miss jessie’s face would it comfort you dearest to think that he does know would it comfort you love to know that his cares his sorrows her voice quivered but she steadied it into calmness mary he has gone before you to the place where the weary are at rest he knows now how you loved him a strange look which was not distress came over miss brown’s face she did not speak for come time but then we saw her lips form the words rather than heard the sound father mother harry archy then as if it were a new idea throwing a filmy shadow over her darkened mind but you will be alone jessie miss jessie had been feeling this all during the silence i think for the tears rolled down her cheeks like rain at these words and she could not answer at first then she put her hands together tight and lifted them up and said but not to us though he slay me yet will i trust in him in a few moments more miss brown lay calm and still never to sorrow or murmur more after this second funeral miss jenkyns insisted that miss jessie should come to stay with her rather than go back to the desolate house which in fact we learned from miss jessie must now be given up as she had not wherewithal to maintain it she had something above twenty pounds a year besides the interest of the money for which the furniture would sell but she could not live upon that and so we talked over her qualifications for earning money i can sew neatly said she and i like nursing i think too i could manage a house if any one would try me as housekeeper or i would go into a shop as saleswoman if they would have patience with me at first miss jenkyns declared in an angry voice that she should do no such thing and talked to herself about some people having no idea of their rank as a captain’s daughter nearly an hour afterwards when she brought miss jessie up a basin of delicately made arrowroot and stood over her like a dragoon until the last spoonful was finished then she disappeared miss jessie began to tell me some more of the plans which had suggested themselves to her and insensibly fell into talking of the days that were past and gone and interested me so much i neither knew nor heeded how time passed we were both startled when miss jenkyns reappeared and caught us crying i was afraid lest she would be displeased as she often said that crying hindered digestion and i knew she wanted miss jessie to get strong but instead she looked queer and excited and fidgeted round us without saying anything at last she spoke i have been so much startled no i’ve not been at all startled don’t mind me my dear miss jessie i’ve been very much surprised in fact i’ve had a caller whom you knew once my dear miss jessie miss jessie went very white then flushed scarlet and looked eagerly at miss jenkyns a gentleman my dear who wants to know if you would see him is it it is not stammered out miss jessie and got no farther this is his card said miss jenkyns giving it to miss jessie and while her head was bent over it miss jenkyns went through a series of winks and odd faces to me and formed her lips into a long sentence of which of course i could not understand a word may he come up asked miss jenkyns at last oh yes certainly said miss jessie as much as to say this is your house you may show any visitor where you like she took up some knitting of miss matty’s and began to be very busy though i could see how she trembled all over miss jenkyns rang the bell and told the servant who answered it to show major gordon upstairs and presently in walked a tall fine frank looking man of forty or upwards he shook hands with miss jessie but he could not see her eyes she kept them so fixed on the ground miss jenkyns asked me if i would come and help her to tie up the preserves in the store room and though miss jessie plucked at my gown and even looked up at me with begging eye i durst not refuse to go where miss jenkyns asked instead of tying up preserves in the store room however we went to talk in the dining room and there miss jenkyns told me what major gordon had told her how he had served in the same regiment with captain brown and had become acquainted with miss jessie then a sweet looking blooming girl of eighteen how the acquaintance had grown into love on his part though it had been some years before he had spoken how on becoming possessed through the will of an uncle of a good estate in scotland he had offered and been refused though with so much agitation and evident distress that he was sure she was not indifferent to him and how he had discovered that the obstacle was the fell disease which was even then too surely threatening her sister she had mentioned that the surgeons foretold intense suffering and there was no one but herself to nurse her poor mary or cheer and comfort her father during the time of illness they had had long discussions and on her refusal to pledge herself to him as his wife when all should be over he had grown angry and broken off entirely and gone abroad believing that she was a cold hearted person whom he would do well to forget he had been travelling in the east and was on his return home when at rome he saw the account of captain brown’s death in _galignani_ just then miss matty who had been out all the morning and had only lately returned to the house burst in with a face of dismay and outraged propriety oh goodness me she said deborah there’s a gentleman sitting in the drawing room with his arm round miss jessie’s waist miss matty’s eyes looked large with terror picture with his arm around miss jessie’s waist miss jenkyns snubbed her down in an instant the most proper place in the world for his arm to be in go away matilda and mind your own business this from her sister who had hitherto been a model of feminine decorum was a blow for poor miss matty and with a double shock she left the room the last time i ever saw poor miss jenkyns was many years after this mrs gordon had kept up a warm and affectionate intercourse with all at cranford miss jenkyns miss matty and miss pole had all been to visit her and returned with wonderful accounts of her house her husband her dress and her looks for with happiness something of her early bloom returned she had been a year or two younger than we had taken her for her eyes were always lovely and as mrs gordon her dimples were not out of place at the time to which i have referred when i last saw miss jenkyns that lady was old and feeble and had lost something of her strong mind little flora gordon was staying with the misses jenkyns and when i came in she was reading aloud to miss jenkyns who lay feeble and changed on the sofa flora put down the _rambler_ when i came in ah said miss jenkyns you find me changed my dear i can’t see as i used to do if flora were not here to read to me i hardly know how i should get through the day did you ever read the _rambler_ it’s a wonderful book wonderful and the most improving reading for flora which i daresay it would have been if she could have read half the words without spelling and could have understood the meaning of a third better than that strange old book with the queer name poor captain brown was killed for reading that book by mr boz you know old poz when i was a girl but that’s a long time ago i acted lucy in old poz she babbled on long enough for flora to get a good long spell at the christmas carol which miss matty had left on the table
