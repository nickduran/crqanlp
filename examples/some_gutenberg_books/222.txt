"1" "not only their own romance but the romance of london she had a real passion for reading rare in her kind who for the most part are more interested in the author than in his book in the painter than in his pictures and she invented a world of the imagination in which she lived with a freedom she never acquired in the world of every day when she came to know writers it was like adventuring upon a stage which till then she had known only from the other side of the footlights she saw them dramatically and really seemed herself to live a larger life because she entertained them and visited them in their fastnesses she accepted the rules with which they played the game of life as valid for them but never for a moment thought of regulating her own conduct in accordance with them their moral eccentricities like their oddities of dress their wild theories and paradoxes were an entertainment which amused her but had not the slightest influence on her convictions is there a mr strickland i asked oh yes he's something in the city i believe he's a stockbroker he's very dull are they good friends they adore one another you'll meet him if you dine there but she doesn't often have people to dinner he's very quiet he's not in the least interested in literature or the arts why do nice women marry dull men because intelligent men won't marry nice women i could not think of any retort to this so i asked if mrs strickland had children yes she has a boy and a girl they're both at school the subject was exhausted and we began to talk of other things chapter v during the summer i met mrs strickland not infrequently i went now and then to pleasant little luncheons at her flat and to rather more formidable tea parties we took a fancy to one another i was very young and perhaps she liked the idea of guiding my virgin steps on the hard road of letters while for me it was pleasant to have someone i could go to with my small troubles certain of an attentive ear and reasonable counsel mrs strickland had the gift of sympathy it is a charming faculty but one often abused by those who are conscious of its possession for there is something ghoulish in the avidity with which they will pounce upon the misfortune of their friends so that they may exercise their dexterity it gushes forth like an oil well and the sympathetic pour out their sympathy with an abandon that is sometimes embarrassing to their victims there are bosoms on which so many tears have been shed that i cannot bedew them with mine mrs strickland used her advantage with tact you felt that you obliged her by accepting her sympathy when in the enthusiasm of my youth i remarked on this to rose waterford she said milk is very nice especially with a drop of brandy in it but the domestic cow is only too glad to be rid of it a swollen udder is very uncomfortable rose waterford had a blistering tongue no one could say such bitter things on the other hand no one could do more charming ones there was another thing i liked in mrs strickland she managed her surroundings with elegance her flat was always neat and cheerful gay with flowers and the chintzes in the drawing room notwithstanding their severe design were bright and pretty the meals in the artistic little dining room were pleasant the table looked nice the two maids were trim and comely the food was well cooked it was impossible not to see that mrs strickland was an excellent housekeeper and you felt sure that she was an admirable mother there were photographs in the drawing room of her son and daughter the son his name was robert was a boy of sixteen at rugby and you saw him in flannels and a cricket cap and again in a tail coat and a stand up collar he had his mother's candid brow and fine reflective eyes he looked clean healthy and normal i don't know that he's very clever she said one day when i was looking at the photograph but i know he's good he has a charming character the daughter was fourteen her hair thick and dark like her mother's fell over her shoulders in fine profusion and she had the same kindly expression and sedate untroubled eyes they're both of them the image of you i said yes i think they are more like me than their father why have you never let me meet him i asked would you like to she smiled her smile was really very sweet and she blushed a little it was singular that a woman of that age should flush so readily perhaps her naivete was her greatest charm you know he's not at all literary she said he's a perfect philistine she said this not disparagingly but affectionately rather as though by acknowledging the worst about him she wished to protect him from the aspersions of her friends he's on the stock exchange and he's a typical broker i think he'd bore you to death does he bore you i asked you see i happen to be his wife i'm very fond of him she smiled to cover her shyness and i fancied she had a fear that i would make the sort of gibe that such a confession could hardly have failed to elicit from rose waterford she hesitated a little her eyes grew tender he doesn't pretend to be a genius he doesn't even make much money on the stock exchange but he's awfully good and kind i think i should like him very much i'll ask you to dine with us quietly some time but mind you come at your own risk don't blame me if you have a very dull evening chapter vi but when at last i met charles strickland it was under circumstances which allowed me to do no more than just make his acquaintance one morning mrs strickland sent me round a note to say that she was giving a dinner party that evening and one of her guests had failed her she asked me to stop the gap she wrote it's only decent to warn you that you will be bored to extinction it was a thoroughly dull party from the beginning but if you will come i shall be uncommonly grateful and you and i can have a little chat by ourselves it was only neighbourly to accept when mrs strickland introduced me to her husband he gave me a rather indifferent hand to shake turning to him gaily she attempted a small jest i asked him to show him that i really had a husband i think he was beginning to doubt it strickland gave the polite little laugh with which people acknowledge a facetiousness in which they see nothing funny but did not speak new arrivals claimed my host's attention and i was left to myself when at last we were all assembled waiting for dinner to be announced i reflected while i chatted with the woman i had been asked to take in that civilised man practises a strange ingenuity in wasting on tedious exercises the brief span of his life it was the kind of party which makes you wonder why the hostess has troubled to bid her guests and why the guests have troubled to come there were ten people they met with indifference and would part with relief it was of course a purely social function the stricklands owed dinners to a number of persons whom they took no interest in and so had asked them these persons had accepted why to avoid the tedium of dining i tete a tete to give their servants a rest because there was no reason to refuse because they were owed a dinner the dining room was inconveniently crowded there was a k.c and his wife a government official and his wife mrs strickland's sister and her husband colonel macandrew and the wife of a member of parliament it was because the member of parliament found that he could not leave the house that i had been invited the respectability of the party was portentous the women were too nice to be well dressed and too sure of their position to be amusing the men were solid there was about all of them an air of well satisfied prosperity everyone talked a little louder than natural in an instinctive desire to make the party go and there was a great deal of noise in the room but there was no general conversation each one talked to his neighbour to his neighbour on the right during the soup fish and entree to his neighbour on the left during the roast sweet and savoury they talked of the political situation and of golf of their children and the latest play of the pictures at the royal academy of the weather and their plans for the holidays there was never a pause and the noise grew louder mrs strickland might congratulate herself that her party was a success her husband played his part with decorum perhaps he did not talk very much and i fancied there was towards the end a look of fatigue in the faces of the women on either side of him they were finding him heavy once or twice mrs strickland's eyes rested on him somewhat anxiously at last she rose and shepherded the ladies out of one room strickland shut the door behind her and moving to the other end of the table took his place between the k.c and the government official he passed round the port again and handed us cigars the k.c remarked on the excellence of the wine and strickland told us where he got it we began to chat about vintages and tobacco the k.c told us of a case he was engaged in and the colonel talked about polo i had nothing to say and so sat silent trying politely to show interest in the conversation and because i thought no one was in the least concerned with me examined strickland at my ease he was bigger than i expected i do not know why i had imagined him slender and of insignificant appearance in point of fact he was broad and heavy with large hands and feet and he wore his evening clothes clumsily he gave you somewhat the idea of a coachman dressed up for the occasion he was a man of forty not good looking and yet not ugly for his features were rather good but they were all a little larger than life size and the effect was ungainly he was clean shaven and his large face looked uncomfortably naked his hair was reddish cut very short and his eyes were small blue or grey he looked commonplace i no longer wondered that mrs strickland felt a certain embarrassment about him he was scarcely a credit to a woman who wanted to make herself a position in the world of art and letters it was obvious that he had no social gifts but these a man can do without he had no eccentricity even to take him out of the common run he was just a good dull honest plain man one would admire his excellent qualities but avoid his company he was null he was probably a worthy member of society a good husband and father an honest broker but there was no reason to waste one's time over him chapter vii the season was drawing to its dusty end and everyone i knew was arranging to go away mrs strickland was taking her family to the coast of norfolk so that the children might have the sea and her husband golf we said good bye to one another and arranged to meet in the autumn but on my last day in town coming out of the stores i met her with her son and daughter like myself she had been making her final purchases before leaving london and we were both hot and tired i proposed that we should all go and eat ices in the park i think mrs strickland was glad to show me her children and she accepted my invitation with alacrity they were even more attractive than their photographs had suggested and she was right to be proud of them i was young enough for them not to feel shy and they chattered merrily about one thing and another they were extraordinarily nice healthy young children it was very agreeable under the trees when in an hour they crowded into a cab to go home i strolled idly to my club i was perhaps a little lonely and it was with a touch of envy that i thought of the pleasant family life of which i had had a glimpse they seemed devoted to one another they had little private jokes of their own which unintelligible to the outsider amused them enormously perhaps charles strickland was dull judged by a standard that demanded above all things verbal scintillation but his intelligence was adequate to his surroundings and that is a passport not only to reasonable success but still more to happiness mrs strickland was a charming woman and she loved him i pictured their lives troubled by no untoward adventure honest decent and by reason of those two upstanding pleasant children so obviously destined to carry on the normal traditions of their race and station not without significance they would grow old insensibly they would see their son and daughter come to years of reason marry in due course the one a pretty girl future mother of healthy children the other a handsome manly fellow obviously a soldier and at last prosperous in their dignified retirement beloved by their descendants after a happy not unuseful life in the fullness of their age they would sink into the grave that must be the story of innumerable couples and the pattern of life it offers has a homely grace it reminds you of a placid rivulet meandering smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees till at last it falls into the vasty sea but the sea is so calm so silent so indifferent that you are troubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness perhaps it is only by a kink in my nature strong in me even in those days that i felt in such an existence the share of the great majority something amiss i recognised its social values i saw its ordered happiness but a fever in my blood asked for a wilder course there seemed to me something alarming in such easy delights in my heart was a desire to live more dangerously i was not unprepared for jagged rocks and treacherous shoals if i could only have change change and the excitement of the unforeseen chapter viii on reading over what i have written of the stricklands i am conscious that they must seem shadowy i have been able to invest them with none of those characteristics which make the persons of a book exist with a real life of their own and wondering if the fault is mine i rack my brains to remember idiosyncrasies which might lend them vividness i feel that by dwelling on some trick of speech or some queer habit i should be able to give them a significance peculiar to themselves as they stand they are like the figures in an old tapestry they do not separate themselves from the background and at a distance seem to lose their pattern so that you have little but a pleasing piece of colour my only excuse is that the impression they made on me was no other there was just that shadowiness about them which you find in people whose lives are part of the social organism so that they exist in it and by it only they are like cells in the body essential but so long as they remain healthy engulfed in the momentous whole the stricklands were an average family in the middle class a pleasant hospitable woman with a harmless craze for the small lions of literary society a rather dull man doing his duty in that state of life in which a merciful providence had placed him two nice looking healthy children nothing could be more ordinary i do not know that there was anything about them to excite the attention of the curious when i reflect on all that happened later i ask myself if i was thick witted not to see that there was in charles strickland at least something out of the common perhaps i think that i have gathered in the years that intervene between then and now a fair knowledge of mankind but even if when i first met the stricklands i had the experience which i have now i do not believe that i should have judged them differently but because i have learnt that man is incalculable i should not at this time of day be so surprised by the news that reached me when in the early autumn i returned to london i had not been back twenty four hours before i ran across rose waterford in jermyn street you look very gay and sprightly i said what's the matter with you she smiled and her eyes shone with a malice i knew already it meant that she had heard some scandal about one of her friends and the instinct of the literary woman was all alert you did meet charles strickland didn't you not only her face but her whole body gave a sense of alacrity i nodded i wondered if the poor devil had been hammered on the stock exchange or run over by an omnibus isn't it dreadful he's run away from his wife miss waterford certainly felt that she could not do her subject justice on the curb of jermyn street and so like an artist flung the bare fact at me and declared that she knew no details i could not do her the injustice of supposing that so trifling a circumstance would have prevented her from giving them but she was obstinate i tell you i know nothing she said in reply to my agitated questions and then with an airy shrug of the shoulders i believe that a young person in a city tea shop has left her situation she flashed a smile at me and protesting an engagement with her dentist jauntily walked on i was more interested than distressed in those days my experience of life at first hand was small and it excited me to come upon an incident among people i knew of the same sort as i had read in books i confess that time has now accustomed me to incidents of this character among my acquaintance but i was a little shocked strickland was certainly forty and i thought it disgusting that a man of his age should concern himself with affairs of the heart with the superciliousness of extreme youth i put thirty five as the utmost limit at which a man might fall in love without making a fool of himself and this news was slightly disconcerting to me personally because i had written from the country to mrs strickland announcing my return and had added that unless i heard from her to the contrary i would come on a certain day to drink a dish of tea with her this was the very day and i had received no word from mrs strickland did she want to see me or did she not it was likely enough that in the agitation of the moment my note had escaped her memory perhaps i should be wiser not to go on the other hand she might wish to keep the affair quiet and it might be highly indiscreet on my part to give any sign that this strange news had reached me i was torn between the fear of hurting a nice woman's feelings and the fear of being in the way i felt she must be suffering and i did not want to see a pain which i could not help but in my heart was a desire that i felt a little ashamed of to see how she was taking it i did not know what to do finally it occurred to me that i would call as though nothing had happened and send a message in by the maid asking mrs strickland if it was convenient for her to see me this would give her the opportunity to send me away but i was overwhelmed with embarrassment when i said to the maid the phrase i had prepared and while i waited for the answer in a dark passage i had to call up all my strength of mind not to bolt the maid came back her manner suggested to my excited fancy a complete knowledge of the domestic calamity will you come this way sir she said i followed her into the drawing room the blinds were partly drawn to darken the room and mrs strickland was sitting with her back to the light her brother in law colonel macandrew stood in front of the fireplace warming his back at an unlit fire to myself my entrance seemed excessively awkward i imagined that my arrival had taken them by surprise and mrs strickland had let me come in only because she had forgotten to put me off i fancied that the colonel resented the interruption i wasn't quite sure if you expected me i said trying to seem unconcerned of course i did anne will bring the tea in a minute even in the darkened room i could not help seeing that mrs strickland's face was all swollen with tears her skin never very good was earthy you remember my brother in law don't you you met at dinner just before the holidays we shook hands i felt so shy that i could think of nothing to say but mrs strickland came to my rescue she asked me what i had been doing with myself during the summer and with this help i managed to make some conversation till tea was brought in the colonel asked for a whisky and soda you'd better have one too amy he said no i prefer tea this was the first suggestion that anything untoward had happened i took no notice and did my best to engage mrs strickland in talk the colonel still standing in front of the fireplace uttered no word i wondered how soon i could decently take my leave and i asked myself why on earth mrs strickland had allowed me to come there were no flowers and various knick knacks put away during the summer had not been replaced there was something cheerless and stiff about the room which had always seemed so friendly it gave you an odd feeling as though someone were lying dead on the other side of the wall i finished tea will you have a cigarette asked mrs strickland she looked about for the box but it was not to be seen i'm afraid there are none suddenly she burst into tears and hurried from the room i was startled i suppose now that the lack of cigarettes brought as a rule by her husband forced him back upon her recollection and the new feeling that the small comforts she was used to were missing gave her a sudden pang she realised that the old life was gone and done with it was impossible to keep up our social pretences any longer i dare say you'd like me to go i said to the colonel getting up i suppose you've heard that blackguard has deserted her he cried explosively i hesitated you know how people gossip i answered i was vaguely told that something was wrong he's bolted he's gone off to paris with a woman he's left amy without a penny i'm awfully sorry i said not knowing what else to say the colonel gulped down his whisky he was a tall lean man of fifty with a drooping moustache and grey hair he had pale blue eyes and a weak mouth i remembered from my previous meeting with him that he had a foolish face and was proud of the fact that for the ten years before he left the army he had played polo three days a week i don't suppose mrs strickland wants to be bothered with me just now i said will you tell her how sorry i am if there's anything i can do i shall be delighted to do it he took no notice of me i don't know what's to become of her and then there are the children are they going to live on air seventeen years what about seventeen years they've been married he snapped i never liked him of course he was my brother in law and i made the best of it did you think him a gentleman she ought never to have married him is it absolutely final there's only one thing for her to do and that's to divorce him that's what i was telling her when you came in fire in with your petition my dear amy i said you owe it to yourself and you owe it to the children he'd better not let me catch sight of him i'd thrash him within an inch of his life i could not help thinking that colonel macandrew might have some difficulty in doing this since strickland had struck me as a hefty fellow but i did not say anything it is always distressing when outraged morality does not possess the strength of arm to administer direct chastisement on the sinner i was making up my mind to another attempt at going when mrs strickland came back she had dried her eyes and powdered her nose i'm sorry i broke down she said i'm glad you didn't go away she sat down i did not at all know what to say i felt a certain shyness at referring to matters which were no concern of mine i did not then know the besetting sin of woman the passion to discuss her private affairs with anyone who is willing to listen mrs strickland seemed to make an effort over herself are people talking about it she asked i was taken aback by her assumption that i knew all about her domestic misfortune i've only just come back the only person i've seen is rose waterford mrs strickland clasped her hands tell me exactly what she said and when i hesitated she insisted i particularly want to know you know the way people talk she's not very reliable is she she said your husband had left you is that all i did not choose to repeat rose waterford's parting reference to a girl from a tea shop i lied she didn't say anything about his going with anyone no that's all i wanted to know i was a little puzzled but at all events i understood that i might now take my leave when i shook hands with mrs strickland i told her that if i could be of any use to her i should be very glad she smiled wanly thank you so much i don't know that anybody can do anything for me too shy to express my sympathy i turned to say good bye to the colonel he did not take my hand i'm just coming if you're walking up victoria street i'll come along with you all right i said come on chapter ix this is a terrible thing he said the moment we got out into the street i realised that he had come away with me in order to discuss once more what he had been already discussing for hours with his sister in law we don't know who the woman is you know he said all we know is that the blackguard's gone to paris i thought they got on so well so they did why just before you came in amy said they'd never had a quarrel in the whole of their married life you know amy there never was a better woman in the world since these confidences were thrust on me i saw no harm in asking a few questions but do you mean to say she suspected nothing nothing he spent august with her and the children in norfolk he was just the same as he'd always been we went down for two or three days my wife and i and i played golf with him he came back to town in september to let his partner go away and amy stayed on in the country they'd taken a house for six weeks and at the end of her tenancy she wrote to tell him on which day she was arriving in london he answered from paris he said he'd made up his mind not to live with her any more what explanation did he give my dear fellow he gave no explanation i've seen the letter it wasn't more than ten lines but that's extraordinary we happened then to cross the street and the traffic prevented us from speaking what colonel macandrew had told me seemed very improbable and i suspected that mrs strickland for reasons of her own had concealed from him some part of the facts it was clear that a man after seventeen years of wedlock did not"
