cept one an stranger that's me the senator's last trade a drove of lean cattle were swinging easily over black mountain and behind them came a big man with wild black hair and a bushy beard now and then he would gnaw at his mustache with his long yellow teeth or would sit down to let his lean horse rest and would flip meaninglessly at the bushes with a switch sometimes his bushy head would droop over on his breast and he would snap it up sharply and start painfully on robber cattle thief outlaw he might have been in another century for he filled the figure of any robber hero in life or romance and yet he was only the senator from bell as he was known in the little kentucky capital or as he was known in his mountain home just the senator who had toiled and schemed and grown rich and grown poor who had suffered long and was kind only that christmas he had gutted every store in town give me everything you have brother he said across each counter and next day every man woman and child in the mountain town had a present from the senator's hands he looked like a brigand that day as he looked now but he called every man his brother and his eye while black and lustreless as night was as brooding and just as kind when the boom went down with it and with everybody else went the senator slowly he got dusty ragged long of hair he looked tortured and ever restless you never saw him still always he swept by you flapping his legs on his lean horse or his arms in his rickety buggy here there everywhere turning twisting fighting his way back to freedom and not a murmur still was every man his brother and if some forgot his once open hand he forgot it no more completely than did the senator he went very far to pay his debts he felt honor bound indeed to ask his sister to give back the farm that he had given her which very properly people said she declined to do nothing could kill hope in the senator's breast he would hand back the farm in another year he said but the sister was firm and without a word still the senator went other ways and schemed through the nights and worked and rode and walked and traded through the days until now when the light was beginning to glimmer his end was come this was the senator's last trade and in sight down in a kentucky valley was home strangely enough the senator did not care at all and he had just enough sanity left to wonder why and to be worried it was the walking typhoid that had caught up with him and he was listless and he made strange gestures and did foolish things as he stumbled down the mountain he was going over a little knoll now and he could see the creek that ran around his house but he was not touched he would just as soon have lain down right where he was or have turned around and gone back except that it was hot and he wanted to get to the water he remembered that it was nigh christmas he saw the snow about him and the cakes of ice in the creek he knew that he ought not to be hot and yet he was so hot that he refused to reason with himself even a minute and hurried on it was odd that it should be so but just about that time over in virginia a cattle dealer nearing home stopped to tell a neighbor how he had tricked some black whiskered fool up in the mountains it may have been just when he was laughing aloud over there that the senator over here tore his woollen shirt from his great hairy chest and rushed into the icy stream clapping his arms to his burning sides and shouting in his frenzy if he had lived a little longer said a constituent he would have lost the next election he hadn't the money you know if he had lived a little longer said the mountain preacher high up on yellow creek i'd have got that trade i had on hand with him through not that i wanted him to die but if he had to why if he had lived a little longer said the senator's lawyer he would have cleaned off the score against him if he had lived a little longer said the senator's sister not meaning to be unkind he would have got all i have that was what life held for the senator death was more kind preachin on kingdom come i've told ye stranger that hell fer sartain empties as it oughter of co'se into kingdom come you can ketch the devil most any day in the week on hell fer sartain an sometimes you can git glory everlastin on kingdom come hit's the only meetin house thar in twenty miles aroun well

goin to be saved shore fer abe's gone fust an ef thar's only one jedgment day the lawd ll nuver git to us a purple rhododendron the purple rhododendron is rare up in the gap here bee rock hung out over roaring rock blossoms with it as a gray cloud purples with the sunrise this rock was tossed lightly on edge when the earth was young and stands vertical to get the flowers you climb the mountain to one side and balancing on the rock's thin edge slip down by roots and past rattlesnake dens till you hang out over the water and reach for them to avoid snakes it is best to go when it is cool at daybreak i know but one other place in this southwest corner of virginia where there is another bush of purple rhododendron and one bush only is there this hangs at the throat of a peak not far away whose ageless gray head is bent over a ravine that sinks like a spear thrust into the side of the mountain swept only by high wind and eagle wings as this is i yet knew one man foolhardy enough to climb to it for a flower he brought one blossom down and to this day i do not know that it was not the act of a coward yes though grayson did it actually smiling all the way from peak to ravine and though he was my best friend best loved then and since i believe he was the strangest man i have ever known and i say this with thought for his eccentricities were sincere in all he did i cannot remember having even suspected anything theatrical but once we were all virginians or kentuckians at the gap and grayson was a virginian you might have guessed that he was a southerner from his voice and from the way he spoke of women but no more otherwise he might have been a moor except for his color which was about the only racial characteristic he had he had been educated abroad and after the english habit had travelled everywhere and yet i can imagine no more lonely way between the eternities than the path grayson trod alone he came to the gap in the early days and just why he came i never knew he had studied the iron question a long time he told me and what i thought reckless speculation was it seems deliberate judgment to him his money in the dirt as the phrase was grayson got him a horse and rode the hills and waited he was intimate with nobody occasionally he would play poker with us and sometimes he drank a good deal but liquor never loosed his tongue at poker his face told as little as the back of his cards and he won more than admiration even from the kentuckians who are artists at the game but the money went from a free hand and after a diversion like this he was apt to be moody and to keep more to himself than ever every fortnight or two he would disappear always over sunday in three or four days he would turn up again black with brooding and then he was the last man to leave the card table or he kept away from it altogether where he went nobody knew and he was not the man anybody would question one night two of us kentuckians were sitting in the club and from a home paper i read aloud the rumored engagement of a girl we both knew who was famous for beauty in the bluegrass as was her mother before her and the mother before her to an unnamed virginian grayson sat near smoking a pipe and when i read the girl's name i saw him take the meerschaum from his lips and i felt his eyes on me it was a mystery how but i knew at once that grayson was the man he sought me out after that and seemed to want to make friends i was willing or rather he made me more than willing for he was irresistible to me as i imagine he would have been to anybody we got to walking together and riding together at night and we were soon rather intimate but for a long time he never so much as spoke the girl's name indeed he kept away from the bluegrass for nearly two months but when he did go he stayed a fortnight this time he came for me as soon as he got back to the gap it was just before midnight and we went as usual back of imboden hill through moon dappled beeches and grayson turned off into the woods where there was no path both of us silent we rode through tremulous shining leaves grayson's horse choosing a way for himself and threshing through a patch of high strong weeds we circled past an amphitheatre of deadened trees whose crooked arms were tossed out into the moonlight and halted on the spur the moon was poised over morris's farm south fork was shining under us like a loop of gold the mountains lay about in tranquil heaps and the moon mist rose luminous between them there grayson turned to me with an eager light in his eyes that i had never seen before this has a new beauty to night he said and then i told her about you and she said that she used to know you well i was glad my face was in shadow i could hardly keep back a brutal laugh and grayson unseeing went on to speak of her as i had never heard any man speak of any woman in the end he said that she had just promised to be his wife i answered nothing other men i knew had said that with the same right perhaps and had gone from her to go back no more and i was one of them grayson had met her at white sulphur five years before and had loved her ever since she had known it from the first he said and i guessed then what was going to happen to him i marvelled listening to the man for it was the star of constancy in her white soul that was most lustrous to him and while i wondered the marvel became a commonplace did not every lover think his loved one exempt from the frailty that names other women there is no ideal of faith or of purity that does not live in countless women to day i believe that but could i not recall one friend who walked with divinity through pine woods for one immortal spring and who being sick to death was quite finished learning her at last did i not know lovers who believed sacred to themselves in the name of love lips that had been given to many another without it and now did i not know but i knew too much and to grayson i said nothing that spring the boom came grayson's property quadrupled in value and quadrupled again i was his lawyer and i plead with him to sell but grayson laughed he was not speculating he had invested on judgment he would sell only at a certain figure the figure was actually reached and grayson let half go the boom fell and grayson took the tumble with a jest it would come again in the autumn he said and he went off to meet the girl at white sulphur i worked right hard that summer but i missed him and i surely was glad when he came back something was wrong i saw it at once he did not mention her name and for a while he avoided even me i sought him then and gradually i got him into our old habit of walking up into the gap and of sitting out after supper on a big rock in the valley listening to the run of the river and watching the afterglow over the cumberland the moon rise over wallen's ridge and the stars come out waiting for him to speak i learned for the first time then another secret of his wretched melancholy it was the hopelessness of that time perhaps that disclosed it grayson had lost the faith of his childhood most men do that at some time or other but grayson had no business no profession no art in which to find relief indeed there was but one substitute possible and that came like a gift straight from the god whom he denied love came and grayson's ideals of love as of everything else were morbid and quixotic he believed that he owed it to the woman he should marry never to have loved another he had loved but one woman he said and he should love but one i believed him then literally when he said that his love for the kentucky girl was his religion now the only anchor left him in his sea of troubles the only star that gave him guiding light without this love what then i had a strong impulse to ask him but grayson shivered as though he divined my thought and in some relentless way our talk drifted to the question of suicide i was not surprised that he"
