"1" "of a small size fifth a ship's telescope which i happened to have in my hand at the time the ship struck and which i had clung to firmly all the time i was in the water indeed it was with difficulty that jack got it out of my grasp when i was lying insensible on the shore i cannot understand why i kept such a firm hold of this telescope they say that a drowning man will clutch at a straw perhaps it may have been some such feeling in me for i did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were wrecked however we felt some pleasure in having it with us now although we did not see that it could be of much use to us as the glass at the small end was broken to pieces our sixth article was a brass ring which jack always wore on his little finger i never understood why he wore it for jack was not vain of his appearance and did not seem to care for ornaments of any kind peterkin said it was in memory of the girl he left behind him but as he never spoke of this girl to either of us i am inclined to think that peterkin was either jesting or mistaken in addition to these articles we had a little bit of tinder and the clothes on our backs these last were as follows each of us had on a pair of stout canvass trousers and a pair of sailors thick shoes jack wore a red flannel shirt a blue jacket and a red kilmarnock bonnet or night cap besides a pair of worsted socks and a cotton pocket handkerchief with sixteen portraits of lord nelson printed on it and a union jack in the middle peterkin had on a striped flannel shirt which he wore outside his trousers and belted round his waist after the manner of a tunic and a round black straw hat he had no jacket having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea but this was not of much consequence as the climate of the island proved to be extremely mild so much so indeed that jack and i often preferred to go about without our jackets peterkin had also a pair of white cotton socks and a blue handkerchief with white spots all over it my own costume consisted of a blue flannel shirt a blue jacket a black cap and a pair of worsted socks besides the shoes and canvass trousers already mentioned this was all we had and besides these things we had nothing else but when we thought of the danger from which we had escaped and how much worse off we might have been had the ship struck on the reef during the night we felt very thankful that we were possessed of so much although i must confess we sometimes wished that we had had a little more while we were examining these things and talking about them jack suddenly started and exclaimed the oar we have forgotten the oar what good will that do us said peterkin there's wood enough on the island to make a thousand oars ay lad replied jack but there's a bit of hoop iron at the end of it and that may be of much use to us very true said i let us go fetch it and with that we all three rose and hastened down to the beach i still felt a little weak from loss of blood so that my companions soon began to leave me behind but jack perceived this and with his usual considerate good nature turned back to help me this was now the first time that i had looked well about me since landing as the spot where i had been laid was covered with thick bushes which almost hid the country from our view as we now emerged from among these and walked down the sandy beach together i cast my eyes about and truly my heart glowed within me and my spirits rose at the beautiful prospect which i beheld on every side the gale had suddenly died away just as if it had blown furiously till it dashed our ship upon the rocks and had nothing more to do after accomplishing that the island on which we stood was hilly and covered almost everywhere with the most beautiful and richly coloured trees bushes and shrubs none of which i knew the names of at that time except indeed the cocoa nut palms which i recognised at once from the many pictures that i had seen of them before i left home a sandy beach of dazzling whiteness lined this bright green shore and upon it there fell a gentle ripple of the sea this last astonished me much for i recollected that at home the sea used to fall in huge billows on the shore long after a storm had subsided but on casting my glance out to sea the cause became apparent about a mile distant from the shore i saw the great billows of the ocean rolling like a green wall and falling with a long loud roar upon a low coral reef where they were dashed into white foam and flung up in clouds of spray this spray sometimes flew exceedingly high and every here and there a beautiful rainbow was formed for a moment among the falling drops we afterwards found that this coral reef extended quite round the island and formed a natural breakwater to it beyond this the sea rose and tossed violently from the effects of the storm but between the reef and the shore it was as calm and as smooth as a pond my heart was filled with more delight than i can express at sight of so many glorious objects and my thoughts turned suddenly to the contemplation of the creator of them all i mention this the more gladly because at that time i am ashamed to say i very seldom thought of my creator although i was constantly surrounded by the most beautiful and wonderful of his works i observed from the expression of my companion's countenance that he too derived much joy from the splendid scenery which was all the more agreeable to us after our long voyage on the salt sea there the breeze was fresh and cold but here it was delightfully mild and when a puff blew off the land it came laden with the most exquisite perfume that can be imagined while we thus gazed we were startled by a loud huzza from peterkin and on looking towards the edge of the sea we saw him capering and jumping about like a monkey and ever and anon tugging with all his might at something that lay upon the shore what an odd fellow he is to be sure said jack taking me by the arm and hurrying forward come let us hasten to see what it is here it is boys hurrah come along just what we want cried peterkin as we drew near still tugging with all his power first rate just the very ticket i need scarcely say to my readers that my companion peterkin was in the habit of using very remarkable and peculiar phrases and i am free to confess that i did not well understand the meaning of some of them such for instance as the very ticket but i think it my duty to recount everything relating to my adventures with a strict regard to truthfulness in as far as my memory serves me so i write as nearly as possible the exact words that my companions spoke i often asked peterkin to explain what he meant by ticket but he always answered me by going into fits of laughter however by observing the occasions on which he used it i came to understand that it meant to show that something was remarkably good or fortunate on coming up we found that peterkin was vainly endeavouring to pull the axe out of the oar into which it will be remembered jack struck it while endeavouring to cut away the cordage among which it had become entangled at the bow of the ship fortunately for us the axe had remained fast in the oar and even now all peterkin's strength could not draw it out of the cut ah that is capital indeed cried jack at the same time giving the axe a wrench that plucked it out of the tough wood how fortunate this is it will be of more value to us than a hundred knives and the edge is quite new and sharp i'll answer for the toughness of the handle at any rate cried peterkin my arms are nearly pulled out of the sockets but see here our luck is great there is iron on the blade he pointed to a piece of hoop iron as he spoke which had been nailed round the blade of the oar to prevent it from splitting this also was a fortunate discovery jack went down on his knees and with the edge of the axe began carefully to force out the nails but as they were firmly fixed in and the operation blunted our axe we carried the oar up with us to the place where we had left the rest of our things intending to burn the wood away from the iron at a more convenient time now lads said jack after we had laid it on the stone which contained our little all i propose that we should go to the tail of the island where the ship struck which is only a quarter of a mile off and see if anything else has been thrown ashore i don't expect anything but it is well to see when we get back here it will be time to have our supper and prepare our beds agreed cried peterkin and i together as indeed we would have agreed to any proposal that jack made for besides his being older and much stronger and taller than either of us he was a very clever fellow and i think would have induced people much older than himself to choose him for their leader especially if they required to be led on a bold enterprise now as we hastened along the white beach which shone so brightly in the rays of the setting sun that our eyes were quite dazzled by its glare it suddenly came into peterkin's head that we had nothing to eat except the wild berries which grew in profusion at our feet what shall we do jack said he with a rueful look perhaps they may be poisonous no fear replied jack confidently i have observed that a few of them are not unlike some of the berries that grow wild on our own native hills besides i saw one or two strange birds eating them just a few minutes ago and what won't kill the birds won't kill us but look up there peterkin continued jack pointing to the branched head of a cocoa nut palm there are nuts for us in all stages so there are cried peterkin who being of a very unobservant nature had been too much taken up with other things to notice anything so high above his head as the fruit of a palm tree but whatever faults my young comrade had he could not be blamed for want of activity or animal spirits indeed the nuts had scarcely been pointed out to him when he bounded up the tall stem of the tree like a squirrel and in a few minutes returned with three nuts each as large as a man's fist you had better keep them till we return raid jack let us finish our work before eating so be it captain go ahead cried peterkin thrusting the nuts into his trousers pocket in fact i don't want to eat just now but i would give a good deal for a drink oh that i could find a spring but i don't see the smallest sign of one hereabouts i say jack how does it happen that you seem to be up to everything you have told us the names of half a dozen trees already and yet you say that you were never in the south seas before i'm not up to _everything_ peterkin as you'll find out ere long replied jack with a smile but i have been a great reader of books of travel and adventure all my life and that has put me up to a good many things that you are perhaps not acquainted with oh jack that's all humbug if you begin to lay everything to the credit of books i'll quite lose my opinion of you cried peterkin with a look of contempt i've seen a lot o fellows that were _always_ poring over books and when they came to try to _do_ anything they were no better than baboons you are quite right retorted jack and i have seen a lot of fellows who never looked into books at all who knew nothing about anything except the things they had actually seen and very little they knew even about these indeed some were so ignorant that they did not know that cocoa nuts grew on cocoa nut trees i could not refrain from laughing at this rebuke for there was much truth in it as to peterkin's ignorance humph maybe you're right answered peterkin but i would not give _tuppence_ for a man of books if he had nothing else in him neither would i said jack but that's no reason why you should run books down or think less of me for having read them suppose now peterkin that you wanted to build a ship and i were to give you a long and particular account of the way to do it would not that be very useful no doubt of it said peterkin laughing and suppose i were to write the account in a letter instead of telling you in words would that be less useful well no perhaps not well suppose i were to print it and send it to you in the form of a book would it not be as good and useful as ever oh bother jack you're a philosopher and that's worse than anything cried peterkin with a look of pretended horror very well peterkin we shall see returned jack halting under the shade of a cocoa nut tree you said you were thirsty just a minute ago now jump up that tree and bring down a nut not a ripe one bring a green unripe one peterkin looked surprised but seeing that jack was in earnest he obeyed now cut a hole in it with your penknife and clap it to your mouth old fellow said jack peterkin did as he was directed and we both burst into uncontrollable laughter at the changes that instantly passed over his expressive countenance no sooner had he put the nut to his mouth and thrown back his head in order to catch what came out of it than his eyes opened to twice their ordinary size with astonishment while his throat moved vigorously in the act of swallowing then a smile and look of intense delight overspread his face except indeed the mouth which being firmly fixed to the hole in the nut could not take part in the expression but he endeavoured to make up for this by winking at us excessively with his right eye at length he stopped and drawing a long breath exclaimed nectar perfect nectar i say jack you're a briton the best fellow i ever met in my life only taste that said he turning to me and holding the nut to my mouth i immediately drank and certainly i was much surprised at the delightful liquid that flowed copiously down my throat it was extremely cool and had a sweet taste mingled with acid in fact it was the likest thing to lemonade i ever tasted and was most grateful and refreshing i handed the nut to jack who after tasting it said now peterkin you unbeliever i never saw or tasted a cocoa nut in my life before except those sold in shops at home but i once read that the green nuts contain that stuff and you see it is true and pray asked peterkin what sort of stuff does the ripe nut contain a hollow kernel answered jack with a liquid like milk in it but it does not satisfy thirst so well as hunger it is very wholesome food i believe meat and drink on the same tree cried peterkin washing in the sea lodging on the ground and all for nothing my dear boys we're set up for life it must be the ancient paradise hurrah and peterkin tossed his straw hat in the air and ran along the beach hallooing like a madman with delight we afterwards found however that these lovely islands were very unlike paradise in many things but more of this in its proper place we had now come to the point of rocks on which the ship had struck but did not find a single article although we searched carefully among the coral rocks which at this place jutted out so far as nearly to join the reef that encircled the island just as we were about to return however we saw something black floating in a little cove that had escaped our observation running forward we drew it from the water and found it to be a long thick leather boot such as fishermen at home wear and a few paces farther on we picked up its fellow we at once recognised these as having belonged to our captain for he had worn them during the whole of the storm in order to guard his legs from the waves and spray that constantly washed over our decks my first thought on seeing them was that our dear captain had been drowned but jack soon put my mind more at rest on that point by saying that if the captain had been drowned with the boots on he would certainly have been washed ashore along with them and that he had no doubt whatever he had kicked them off while in the sea that he might swim more easily peterkin immediately put them on but they were so large that as jack said they would have done for boots trousers and vest too i also tried them but although i was long enough in the legs for them they were much too large in the feet for me so we handed them to jack who was anxious to make me keep them but as they fitted his large limbs and feet as if they had been made for him i would not hear of it so he consented at last to use them i may remark however that jack did not use them often as they were extremely heavy it was beginning to grow dark when we returned to our encampment so we put off our visit to the top of a hill till next day and employed the light that yet remained to us in cutting down a quantity of boughs and the broad leaves of a tree of which none of us knew the name with these we erected a sort of rustic bower in which we meant to pass the night there was no absolute necessity for this because the air of our island was so genial and balmy that we could have slept quite well without any shelter but we were so little used to sleeping in the open air that we did not quite relish the idea of lying down without any covering over us besides our bower would shelter us from the night dews or rain if any should happen to fall having strewed the floor with leaves and dry grass we bethought ourselves of supper but it now occurred to us for the first time that we had no means of making a fire now there's a fix what shall we do said peterkin while we both turned our eyes to jack to whom we always looked in our difficulties jack seemed not a little perplexed there are flints enough no doubt on the beach said he but they are of no use at all without a steel however we must try so saying he went to the beach and soon returned with two flints on one of these he placed the tinder and endeavoured to ignite it but it was with great difficulty that a very small spark was struck out of the flints and the tinder being a bad hard piece would not catch he then tried the bit of hoop iron which would not strike fire at all and after that the back of the axe with no better success during all these trials peterkin sat with his hands in his pockets gazing with a most melancholy visage at our comrade his face growing longer and more miserable at each successive failure oh dear he sighed i would not care a button for the cooking of our victuals perhaps they don't need it but it's so dismal to eat one's supper in the dark and we have had such a capital day that it's a pity to finish off in this glum style oh i have it he cried starting up the spy glass the big glass at the end is a burning glass you forget that we have no sun said i peterkin was silent in his sudden recollection of the telescope he had quite overlooked the absence of the sun ah boys i've got it now exclaimed jack rising and cutting a branch from a neighbouring bush which be stripped of its leaves i recollect seeing this done once at home hand me the bit of whip cord with the cord and branch jack soon formed a bow then he cut a piece about three inches long off the end of a dead branch which he pointed at the two ends round this he passed the cord of the bow and placed one end against his chest which was protected from its point by a chip of wood the other point he placed against the bit of tinder and then began to saw vigorously with the bow just as a blacksmith does with his drill while boring a hole in a piece of iron in a few seconds the tinder began to smoke in less than a minute it caught fire and in less than a quarter of an hour we were drinking our lemonade and eating cocoa nuts round a fire that would have roasted an entire sheep while the smoke flames and sparks flew up among the broad leaves of the overhanging palm trees and cast a warm glow upon our leafy bower that night the starry sky looked down through the gently rustling trees upon our slumbers and the distant roaring of the surf upon the coral reef was our lullaby chapter v morning and cogitations connected therewith we luxuriate in the sea try our diving powers and make enchanting excursions among the coral groves at the bottom of the ocean the wonders of the deep enlarged upon what a joyful thing it is to awaken on a fresh glorious morning and find the rising sun staring into your face with dazzling brilliancy to see the birds twittering in the bushes and to hear the murmuring of a rill or the soft hissing ripples as they fall upon the sea shore at any time and in any place such sights and sounds are most charming but more especially are they so when one awakens to them for the fist time in a novel and romantic situation with the soft sweet air of a tropical climate mingling with the fresh smell of the sea and stirring the strange leaves that flutter overhead and around one or ruffling the plumage of the stranger birds that fly inquiringly around as if to demand what business we have to intrude uninvited on their domains when i awoke on the morning after the shipwreck i found myself in this most delightful condition and as i lay on my back upon my bed of leaves gazing up through the branches of the cocoa nut trees into the clear blue sky and watched the few fleecy clouds that passed slowly across it my heart expanded more and more with an exulting gladness the like of which i had never felt before while i meditated my thoughts again turned to the great and kind creator of this beautiful world as they had done on the previous day when i first beheld the sea and the coral reef with the mighty waves dashing over it into the calm waters of the lagoon while thus meditating i naturally bethought me of my bible for i had faithfully kept the promise which i gave at parting to my beloved mother that i would read it every morning and it was with a feeling of dismay that i remembered i had left it in the ship i was much troubled about this however i consoled myself with reflecting that i could keep the second part of my promise to her namely that i should never omit to say my prayers so i rose quietly lest i should disturb my companions who were still asleep and stepped aside into the bushes for this purpose on my return i found them still slumbering so i again lay down to think over our situation just at that moment i was attracted by the sight of a very small parrot which jack afterwards told me was called a paroquet it was seated on a twig that overhung peterkin's head and i was speedily lost in admiration of its bright green plumage which was mingled with other gay colours while i looked i observed that the bird turned its head slowly from side to side and looked downwards fist with the one eye and then with the other on glancing downwards i observed that peterkin's mouth was wide open and that this remarkable bird was looking into it peterkin used to say that i had not an atom of fun in my composition and that i never could understand a joke in regard to the latter perhaps he was right yet i think that when they were explained to me i understood jokes as well as most people but in regard to the former he must certainly have been wrong for this bird seemed to me to be extremely funny and i could not help thinking that if it should happen to faint or slip its foot and fall off the twig into peterkin's mouth he would perhaps think it funny too suddenly the paroquet bent down its head and uttered a loud scream in his face this awoke him and with a cry of surprise he started up while the foolish bird flew precipitately away oh you monster cried peterkin shaking his fist at the bird then he yawned and rubbed his eyes and asked what o'clock it was i smiled at this question and answered that as our watches were at the bottom of the sea i could not tell but it was a little past sunrise peterkin now began to remember where we were as he looked up into the bright sky and snuffed the scented air his eyes glistened with delight and he uttered a faint hurrah and yawned again then he gazed slowly round till observing the calm sea through an opening in the bushes he started suddenly up as if he had received an electric shock uttered a vehement shout flung off his garments and rushing over the white sands plunged into the water the cry awoke jack who rose on his elbow with a look of grave surprise but this was followed by a quiet smile of intelligence on seeing peterkin in the water with an energy that he only gave way to in moments of excitement jack bounded to his feet threw off his clothes shook back his hair and with a lion like spring dashed over the sands and plunged into the sea with such force as quite to envelop peterkin in a shower of spray jack was a remarkably good swimmer and diver so that after his plunge we saw no sign of him for nearly a minute after which he suddenly emerged with a cry of joy a good many yards out from the shore my spirits were so much raised by seeing all this that i too hastily threw off my garments and endeavoured to imitate jack's vigorous bound but i was so awkward that my foot caught on a stump and i fell to the ground then i slipped on a stone while running over the mud and nearly fell again much to the amusement of peterkin who laughed heartily and called me a slow coach while jack cried out come along ralph and i'll help you however when i got into the water i managed very well for i was really a good swimmer and diver too i could not indeed equal jack who was superior to any englishman i ever saw but i infinitely surpassed peterkin who could only swim a little and could not dive at all while peterkin enjoyed himself in the shallow water and in running along the beach jack and i swam out into the deep water and occasionally"
