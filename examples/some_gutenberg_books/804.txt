cuff of my coat in order to finish her reply so some way or other god knows how i regained my situation she had nothing to add i forthwith began to model a different conversation for the lady thinking from the spirit as well as moral of this that i had been mistaken in her character but upon turning her face towards me the spirit which had animated the reply was fled the muscles relaxed and i beheld the same unprotected look of distress which first won me to her interest melancholy to see such sprightliness the prey of sorrow i pitied her from my soul and though it may seem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart i could have taken her into my arms and cherished her though it was in the open street without brushing the pulsations of the arteries along my fingers pressing across hers told her what was passing within me she looked down a silence of some moments followed i fear in this interval i must have made some slight efforts towards a closer compression of her hand from a subtle sensation i felt in the palm of my own not as if she was going to withdraw hers but as if she thought about it and i had infallibly lost it a second time had not instinct more than reason directed me to the last resource in these dangers to hold it loosely and in a manner as if i was every moment going to release it of myself so she let it continue till monsieur dessein returned with the key and in the mean time i set myself to consider how i should undo the ill impressions which the poor monk’s story in case he had told it her must have planted in her breast against me the snuff box calais the good old monk was within six paces of us as the idea of him crossed my mind and was advancing towards us a little out of the line as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no he stopp’d however as soon as he came up to us with a world of frankness and having a horn snuff box in his hand he presented it open to me you shall taste mine said i pulling out my box which was a small tortoise one and putting it into his hand tis most excellent said the monk then do me the favour i replied to accept of the box and all and when you take a pinch out of it sometimes recollect it was the peace offering of a man who once used you unkindly but not from his heart the poor monk blush’d as red as scarlet _mon dieu_ said he pressing his hands together you never used me unkindly i should think said the lady he is not likely i blush’d in my turn but from what movements i leave to the few who feel to analyze excuse me madame replied i i treated him most unkindly and from no provocations tis impossible said the lady my god cried the monk with a warmth of asseveration which seem’d not to belong to him the fault was in me and in the indiscretion of my zeal the lady opposed it and i joined with her in maintaining it was impossible that a spirit so regulated as his could give offence to any i knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as i then felt it we remained silent without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one another’s faces without saying a word whilst this lasted the monk rubbed his horn box upon the sleeve of his tunic and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the friction he made me a low bow and said twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contest but be it as it would he begg’d we might exchange boxes in saying this he presented his to me with one hand as he took mine from me in the other and having kissed it with a stream of good nature in his eyes he put it into his bosom and took his leave i guard this box as i would the instrumental parts of my religion to help my mind on to something better in truth i seldom go abroad without it and oft and many a time have i called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own in the justlings of the world they had found full employment for his as i learnt from his story till about the forty fifth year of his age when upon some military services ill requited and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenderest of passions he abandoned the sword and the sex together and took sanctuary not so much in his convent as in himself i feel a damp upon my spirits as i am going to add that in my last return through calais upon enquiring after father lorenzo i heard he had been dead near three months and was buried not in his convent but according to his desire in a little cemetery belonging to it about two leagues off i had a strong desire to see where they had laid him when upon pulling out his little horn box as i sat by his grave and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it which had no business to grow there they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections that i burst into a flood of tears but i am as weak as a woman and i beg the world not to smile but to pity me the remise door calais i had never quitted the lady’s hand all this time and had held it so long that it would have been indecent to have let it go without first pressing it to my lips the blood and spirits which had suffered a revulsion from her crowded back to her as i did it now the two travellers who had spoke to me in the coach yard happening at that crisis to be passing by and observing our communications naturally took it into their heads that we must be _man and wife_ at least so stopping as soon as they came up to the door of the remise the one of them who was the inquisitive traveller ask’d us if we set out for paris the next morning i could only answer for myself i said and the lady added she was for amiens we dined there yesterday said the simple traveller you go directly through the town added the other in your road to paris i was going to return a thousand thanks for the intelligence _that amiens was in the road to paris_ but upon pulling out my poor monk’s little horn box to take a pinch of snuff i made them a quiet bow and wishing them a good passage to dover they left us alone now where would be the harm said i to myself if i were to beg of this distressed lady to accept of half of my chaise and what mighty mischief could ensue every dirty passion and bad propensity in my nature took the alarm as i stated the proposition it will oblige you to have a third horse said avarice which will put twenty livres out of your pocket you know not what she is said caution or what scrapes the affair may draw you into whisper’d cowardice depend upon it yorick said discretion twill be said you went off with a mistress and came by assignation to calais for that purpose you can never after cried hypocrisy aloud show your face in the world or rise quoth meanness in the church or be any thing in it said pride but a lousy prebendary but tis a civil thing said i and as i generally act from the first impulse and therefore seldom listen to these cabals which serve no purpose that i know of but to encompass the heart with adamant i turned instantly about to the lady but she had glided off unperceived as the cause was pleading and had made ten or a dozen paces down the street by the time i had made the determination so i set off after her with a long stride to make her the proposal with the best address i was master of but observing she walk’d with her cheek half resting upon the palm of her hand with the slow short measur’d step of thoughtfulness and with her eyes as she went step by step fixed upon the ground it struck me she was trying the same cause herself god help her said i she has some mother in law or tartufish aunt or nonsensical old woman to consult upon the occasion as well as myself so not caring to interrupt the process and deeming it more gallant to take her at discretion than by surprise i faced about and took a short turn or two before the door of the remise whilst she walk’d musing on one side in the street calais having on the first sight of the lady settled the affair in my fancy that she was of the better order of beings and then laid it down as a second axiom as indisputable as the first that she was a widow and wore a character of distress i went no further i got ground enough for the situation which pleased me and had she remained close beside my elbow till midnight i should have held true to my system and considered her only under that general idea she had scarce got twenty paces distant from me ere something within me called out for a more particular enquiry it brought on the idea of a further separation i might possibly never see her more the heart is for saving what it can and i wanted the traces through which my wishes might find their way to her in case i should never rejoin her myself in a word i wished to know her name her family’s her condition and as i knew the place to which she was going i wanted to know from whence she came but there was no coming at all this intelligence a hundred little delicacies stood in the way i form’d a score different plans there was no such thing as a man’s asking her directly the thing was impossible a little french _débonnaire_ captain who came dancing down the street showed me it was the easiest thing in the world for popping in betwixt us just as the lady was returning back to the door of the remise he introduced himself to my acquaintance and before he had well got announced begg’d i would do him the honour to present him to the lady i had not been presented myself so turning about to her he did it just as well by asking her if she had come from paris no she was going that route she said _vous n’êtes pas de londres_ she was not she replied then madame must have come through flanders _apparemment vous êtes flammande_ said the french captain the lady answered she was _peut être de lisle_ added he she said she was not of lisle nor arras nor cambray nor ghent nor brussels she answered she was of brussels he had had the honour he said to be at the bombardment of it last war that it was finely situated _pour cela_ and full of noblesse when the imperialists were driven out by the french the lady made a slight courtesy so giving her an account of the affair and of the share he had had in it he begg’d the honour to know her name so made his bow _et madame a son mari_ said he looking back when he had made two steps and without staying for an answer danced down the street had i served seven years apprenticeship to good breeding i could not have done as much the remise calais as the little french captain left us mons dessein came up with the key of the remise in his hand and forthwith let us into his magazine of chaises the first object which caught my eye as mons dessein open’d the door of the remise was another old tatter’d _désobligeant_ and notwithstanding it was the exact picture of that which had hit my fancy so much in the coach yard but an hour before the very sight of it stirr’d up a disagreeable sensation within me now and i thought twas a churlish beast into whose heart the idea could first enter to construct such a machine nor had i much more charity for the man who could think of using it i observed the lady was as little taken with it as myself so mons dessein led us on to a couple of chaises which stood abreast telling us as he recommended them that they had been purchased by my lord a and b to go the grand tour but had gone no further than paris so were in all respects as good as new they were too good so i pass’d on to a third which stood behind and forthwith begun to chaffer for the price but twill scarce hold two said i opening the door and getting in have the goodness madame said mons dessein offering his arm to step in the lady hesitated half a second and stepped in and the waiter that moment beckoning to speak to mon dessein he shut the door of the chaise upon us and left us the remise calais _c’est bien comique_ tis very droll said the lady smiling from the reflection that this was the second time we had been left together by a parcel of nonsensical contingencies _c’est bien comique_ said she there wants nothing said i to make it so but the comic use which the gallantry of a frenchman would put it to to make love the first moment and an offer of his person the second tis their _fort_ replied the lady it is supposed so at least and how it has come to pass continued i i know not but they have certainly got the credit of understanding more of love and making it better than any other nation upon earth but for my own part i think them arrant bunglers and in truth the worst set of marksmen that ever tried cupid’s patience to think of making love by _sentiments_ i should as soon think of making a genteel suit of clothes out of remnants and to do it pop at first sight by declaration is submitting the offer and themselves with it to be sifted with all their _pours_ and _contres_ by an unheated mind the lady attended as if she expected i should go on consider then madame continued i laying my hand upon hers that grave people hate love for the name’s sake that selfish people hate it for their own hypocrites for heaven’s and that all of us both old and young being ten times worse frightened than hurt by the very _report_ what a want of knowledge in this branch of commence a man betrays whoever lets the word come out of his lips till an hour or two at least after the time that his silence upon it becomes tormenting a course of small quiet attentions not so pointed as to alarm nor so vague as to be misunderstood with now and then a look of kindness and little or nothing said upon it leaves nature for your mistress and she fashions it to her mind then i solemnly declare said the lady blushing you have been making love to me all this while the remise calais monsieur dessein came back to let us out of the chaise and acquaint the lady the count de l her brother was just arrived at the hotel though i had infinite good will for the lady i cannot say that i rejoiced in my heart at the event and could not help telling her so for it is fatal to a proposal madame said i that i was going to make to you you need not tell me what the proposal was said she laying her hand upon both mine as she interrupted me a man my good sir has seldom an offer of kindness to make to a woman but she has a presentiment of it some moments before nature arms her with it said i for immediate preservation but i think said she looking in my face i had no evil to apprehend and to deal frankly with you had determined to accept it if i had she stopped a moment i believe your good will would have drawn a story from me which would have made pity the only dangerous thing in the journey in saying this she suffered me to kiss her hand twice and with a look of sensibility mixed with concern she got out of the chaise and bid adieu in the street calais i never finished a twelve guinea bargain so expeditiously in my life my time seemed heavy upon the loss of the lady and knowing every moment of it would be as two till i put myself into motion i ordered post horses directly and walked towards the hotel lord said i hearing the town clock strike four and recollecting that i had been little more than a single hour in calais what a large volume of adventures may be grasped within this little span of life by him who interests his heart in every thing and who having eyes to see what time and chance are perpetually holding out to him as he journeyeth on his way misses nothing he can _fairly_ lay his hands on if this won’t turn out something another will no matter tis an assay upon human nature i get my labour for my pains tis enough the pleasure of the experiment has kept my senses and the best part of my blood awake and laid the gross to sleep i pity the man who can travel from dan to beersheba and cry tis all barren and so it is and so is all the world to him who will not cultivate the fruits it offers i declare said i clapping my hands cheerily together that were i in a desert i would find out wherewith in it to call forth my affections if i could not do better i would fasten them upon some sweet myrtle or seek some melancholy cypress to connect myself to i would court their shade and greet them kindly for their protection i would cut my name upon them and swear they were the loveliest trees throughout the desert if their leaves wither’d i would teach myself to mourn and when they rejoiced i would rejoice along with them the learned smelfungus travelled from boulogne to paris from paris to rome and so on but he set out with the spleen and jaundice and every object he pass’d by was discoloured or distorted he wrote an account of them but twas nothing but the account of his miserable feelings i met smelfungus in the grand portico of the pantheon he was just coming out of it _tis nothing but a huge cockpit_ 580 said he i wish you had said nothing worse of the venus of medicis replied i for in passing through florence i had heard he had fallen foul upon the goddess and used her worse than a common strumpet without the least provocation in nature i popp’d upon smelfungus again at turin in his return home and a sad tale of sorrowful adventures had he to tell wherein he spoke of moving accidents by flood and field and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi he had been flayed alive and bedevil’d and used worse than st bartholomew at every stage he had come at i’ll tell it cried smelfungus to the world you had better tell it said i to your physician mundungus with an immense fortune made the whole tour going on from rome to naples from naples to venice from venice to vienna to dresden to berlin without one generous connection or pleasurable anecdote to tell of but he had travell’d straight on looking neither to his right hand nor his left lest love or pity should seduce him out of his road peace be to them if it is to be found but heaven itself were it possible to get there with such tempers would want objects to give it every gentle spirit would come flying upon the wings of love to hail their arrival nothing would the souls of smelfungus and mundungus hear of but fresh anthems of joy fresh raptures of love and fresh congratulations of their common felicity i heartily pity them they have brought up no faculties for this work and were the happiest mansion in heaven to be allotted to smelfungus and mundungus they would be so far from being happy that the souls of smelfungus and mundungus would do penance there to all eternity montreuil i had once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise and twice got out in the rain and one of the times up to the knees in dirt to help the postilion to tie it on without being able to find out what was wanting nor was it till i got to montreuil upon the landlord’s asking me if i wanted not a servant that it occurred to me that that was the very thing a servant that i do most sadly quoth i because monsieur said the landlord there is a clever young fellow who would be very proud of the honour to serve an englishman but why an english one more than any other they are so generous said the landlord i’ll be shot if this is not a livre out of my pocket quoth i to myself this very night but they have wherewithal to be so monsieur added he set down one livre more for that quoth i it was but last night said the landlord _qu’un milord anglois présentoit un écu à la fille de chambre_ _tant pis pour mademoiselle janatone_ said i now janatone being the landlord’s daughter and the landlord supposing i was young in french took the liberty to inform me i should not have said _tant pis_ but _tant mieux_ _tant mieux_ _toujours_ _monsieur_ said he when there is any thing to be got _tant pis_ when there is nothing it comes to the same thing said i _pardonnez moi_ said the landlord i cannot take a fitter opportunity to observe once for all that _tant pis_ and _tant mieux_ being two of the great hinges in french conversation a stranger would do well to set himself right in the use of them before he gets to paris a prompt french marquis at our ambassador’s table demanded of mr h if he was h the poet no said mr h mildly _tant pis_ replied the marquis it is h the historian said another _tant mieux_ said the marquis and mr h who is a man of an excellent heart return’d thanks for both when the landlord had set me right in this matter he called in la fleur which was the name of the young man he had spoke of saying only first that as for his talents he would presume to say nothing monsieur was the best judge what would suit him but for the fidelity of la fleur he would stand responsible in all he was worth the landlord deliver’d this in a manner which instantly set my mind to the business i was upon and la fleur who stood waiting without in that breathless expectation which every son of nature of us have felt in our turns came in montreuil i am apt to be taken with all kinds of people at first sight but never more so than when a poor devil comes to offer his service to so poor a devil as myself and as i know this weakness i always suffer my judgment to draw back something on that very account and this more or less according to the mood i am in and the case and i may add the gender too of the person i am to govern when la fleur entered the room after every discount i could make for my soul the genuine look and air of the fellow determined the matter at once in his favour so i hired him first and then began to enquire what he could do but i shall find out his talents quoth i as i want them besides a frenchman can do every thing now poor la fleur could do nothing in the world but beat a drum and play a march or two upon the fife i was determined to make his talents do and can’t say my weakness was ever so insulted by my wisdom as in the attempt la fleur had set out early in life as gallantly as most frenchmen do with _serving_ for a few years at the end of which having satisfied the sentiment and found moreover that the honour of beating a drum was likely to be its own reward as it open’d no further track of glory to him he retired _à ses terres_ and lived _comme il plaisoit à dieu_ that is to say upon nothing and so quoth wisdom you have hired a drummer to attend you in this tour of yours through france and italy psha said i and do not one half of our gentry go with a humdrum _compagnon du voyage_ the same round and have the piper and the devil and all to pay besides when man can extricate himself with an _équivoque_ in such an unequal match he is not ill off but you can do something else la fleur said i _o qu’oui_ he could make spatterdashes and play a little upon the fiddle bravo said wisdom why i play a bass myself said i we shall do very well you can shave and dress a wig a little la fleur he had all the dispositions in the world it is enough for heaven said i interrupting him and ought to be enough for me so supper coming in and having a frisky english spaniel on one side of my chair and a french valet with as much hilarity in his countenance as ever nature painted in one on the other i was satisfied to my heart’s content with my empire and if monarchs knew what they would be at they might be as satisfied as i was montreuil as la fleur went the whole tour of france and italy with me and will be often upon the stage i must interest the reader a little further in his behalf by saying that i had never less reason to repent of the impulses which generally do determine me than in regard to this fellow he was a faithful affectionate simple soul as ever trudged after the heels of a philosopher and notwithstanding his talents of drum beating and spatterdash making which though very good in themselves happened to be of no great service to me yet was i hourly recompensed by the festivity of his temper it supplied all defects i had a constant resource in his looks in all difficulties and distresses of my own i was going to have added of his too but la fleur was out of the reach of every thing for whether twas hunger or thirst or cold or nakedness or watchings or whatever stripes of ill luck la fleur met with in our journeyings there was no index in his physiognomy to point them out by he was eternally the same so that if i am a piece of a philosopher which satan now and then puts it into my head i am it always mortifies the pride of the conceit by reflecting how much i owe to the complexional philosophy of this poor fellow for shaming me into one of a better kind with all this la fleur had a small cast of the coxcomb but he seemed at first sight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art and before i had been three days in paris with him he seemed to be no coxcomb at all montreuil the next morning la fleur entering upon his employment i delivered to him the key of my portmanteau with an inventory of my half a dozen shirts and silk pair of breeches and bid him fasten all upon the chaise get the horses put to and desire the landlord to come in with his bill _c’est un garcon de bonne fortune_ said the landlord pointing through the window to half a dozen wenches who had got round about la fleur and were most kindly taking their leave of him as the postilion was leading out the horses la fleur kissed all their hands round and round again and thrice he wiped his"
