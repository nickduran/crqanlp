glanced now and again at each other after a time we ceased to do that and looked only at the time traveller's face iii i told some of you last thursday of the principles of the time machine and showed you the actual thing itself incomplete in the workshop there it is now a little travel worn truly and one of the ivory bars is cracked and a brass rail bent but the rest of it's sound enough i expected to finish it on friday but on friday when the putting together was nearly done i found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short and this i had to get remade so that the thing was not complete until this morning it was at ten o'clock to day that the first of all time machines began its career i gave it a last tap tried all the screws again put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddle i suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as i felt then i took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other pressed the first and almost immediately the second i seemed to reel i felt a nightmare sensation of falling and looking round i saw the laboratory exactly as before had anything happened for a moment i suspected that my intellect had tricked me then i noted the clock a moment before as it seemed it had stood at a minute or so past ten now it was nearly half past three i drew a breath set my teeth gripped the starting lever with both hands and went off with a thud the laboratory got hazy and went dark mrs watchett came in and walked apparently without seeing me towards the garden door i suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket i pressed the lever over to its extreme position the night came like the turning out of a lamp and in another moment came to morrow the laboratory grew faint and hazy then fainter and ever fainter to morrow night came black then day again night again day again faster and faster still an eddying murmur filled my ears and a strange dumb confusedness descended on my mind i am afraid i cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling they are excessively unpleasant there is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback of a helpless headlong motion i felt the same horrible anticipation too of an imminent smash as i put on pace night followed day like the flapping of a black wing the dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me and i saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky leaping it every minute and every minute marking a day i supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and i had come into the open air i had a dim impression of scaffolding but i was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things the slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me the twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye then in the intermittent darknesses i saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars presently as i went on still gaining velocity the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight the jerking sun became a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space the moon a fainter fluctuating band and i could see nothing of the stars save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue the landscape was misty and vague i was still on the hill side upon which this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim i saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour now brown now green they grew spread shivered and passed away i saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair and pass like dreams the whole surface of the earth seemed changed melting and flowing under my eyes the little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster presently i noted that the sun belt swayed up and down from solstice to solstice in a minute or less and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world and vanished and was followed by the bright brief green of spring the unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now they merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration i remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which i was unable to account but my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a kind of madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at first i scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but these new sensations but presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread until at last they took complete possession of me what strange developments of humanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilization i thought might not appear when i came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes i saw great and splendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildings of our own time and yet as it seemed built of glimmer and mist i saw a richer green flow up the hill side and remain there without any wintry intermission even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair and so my mind came round to the business of stopping the peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which i or the machine occupied so long as i travelled at a high velocity through time this scarcely mattered i was so to speak attenuated was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances but to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself molecule by molecule into whatever lay in my way meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction possibly a far reaching explosion would result and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions into the unknown this possibility had occurred to me again and again while i was making the machine but then i had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk one of the risks a man has got to take now the risk was inevitable i no longer saw it in the same cheerful light the fact is that insensibly the absolute strangeness of everything the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine above all the feeling of prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerve i told myself that i could never stop and with a gust of petulance i resolved to stop forthwith like an impatient fool i lugged over the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling over and i was flung headlong through the air there was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears i may have been stunned for a moment a pitiless hail was hissing round me and i was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone i looked round me i was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden surrounded by rhododendron bushes and i noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail stones the rebounding dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine and drove along the ground like smoke in a moment i was wet to the skin fine hospitality said i to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you presently i thought what a fool i was to get wet i stood up and looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently in some white stone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour but all else of the world was invisible my sensations would be hard to describe as the columns of hail grew thinner i saw the white figure more distinctly it was very large for a silver birch tree touched its shoulder it was of white marble in shape something like a winged sphinx but the wings instead of being carried vertically at the sides were spread so that it seemed to hover the pedestal it appeared to me was of bronze and was thick with verdigris it chanced that the face was towards me the sightless eyes seemed to watch me there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips it was greatly weather worn and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease i stood looking at it for a little space half a minute perhaps or half an hour it seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun i looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn what might not have happened to men what if cruelty had grown into a common passion what if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly powerful i might seem some old world savage animal only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness a foul creature to be incontinently slain already i saw other vast shapes huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns with a wooded hill side dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm i was seized with a panic fear i turned frantically to the time machine and strove hard to readjust it as i did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm the grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost above me in the intense blue of the summer sky some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct shining with the wet of the thunderstorm and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses i felt naked in a strange world i felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop my fear grew to frenzy i took a breathing space set my teeth and again grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine it gave under my desperate onset and turned over it struck my chin violently one hand on the saddle the other on the lever i stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again but with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered i looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future in a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer house i saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes they had seen me and their faces were directed towards me then i heard voices approaching me coming through the bushes by the white sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running one of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which i stood with my machine he was a slight creature perhaps four feet high clad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a leather belt sandals or buskins i could not clearly distinguish which were on his feet his legs were bare to the knees and his head was bare noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm the air was he struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature but indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much at the sight of him i suddenly regained confidence i took my hands from the machine iv in another moment we were standing face to face i and this fragile thing out of futurity he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue there were others coming and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me one of them addressed me it came into my head oddly enough that my voice was too harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and pointing to my ears shook it again he came a step forward hesitated and then touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders they wanted to make sure i was real there was nothing in this at all alarming indeed there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence a graceful gentleness a certain childlike ease and besides they looked so frail that i could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine pins but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine happily then when it was not too late i thought of a danger i had hitherto forgotten and reaching over the bars of the machine i unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion and put these in my pocket then i turned again to see what i could do in the way of communication and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some further peculiarities in their dresden china type of prettiness their hair which was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face and their ears were singularly minute the mouths were small with bright red rather thin lips and the little chins ran to a point the eyes were large and mild and this may seem egotism on my part i fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest i might have expected in them as they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other i began the conversation i pointed to the time machine and to myself then hesitating for a moment how to express time i pointed to the sun at once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder for a moment i was staggered though the import of his gesture was plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly were these creatures fools you may hardly understand how it took me you see i had always anticipated that the people of the year eight hundred and two thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge art everything then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five year old children asked me in fact if i had come from the sun in a thunderstorm it let loose the judgment i had suspended upon their clothes their frail light limbs and fragile features a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind for a moment i felt that i had built the time machine in vain i nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them they all withdrew a pace or so and bowed then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck the idea was received with melodious applause and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging them upon me until i was almost smothered with blossom you who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building and so i was led past the sphinx of white marble which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone as i went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistible merriment to my mind the building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossal dimensions i was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious my general impression of the world i saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers a long neglected and yet weedless garden i saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals they grew scattered as if wild among the variegated shrubs but as i say i did not examine them closely at this time the time machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons the arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally i did not observe the carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw suggestions of old phoenician decorations as i passed through and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather worn several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway and so we entered i dressed in dingy nineteenth century garments looking grotesque enough garlanded with flowers and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright soft colored robes and shining white limbs in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech the big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown the roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered light the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal not plates nor slabs blocks and it was so much worn as i judged by the going to and fro of past generations as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone raised perhaps a foot from the floor and upon these were heaps of fruits some i recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange but for the most part they were strange between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions upon these my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do likewise with a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into the round openings in the sides of the tables i was not loath to follow their example for i felt thirsty and hungry as i did so i surveyed the hall at my leisure and perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look the stained glass windows which displayed only a geometrical pattern were broken in many places and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust and it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured nevertheless the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque there were perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating all were clad in the same soft and yet strong silky material fruit by the by was all their diet these people of the remote future were strict vegetarians and while i was with them in spite of some carnal cravings i had to be frugivorous also indeed i found afterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed the ichthyosaurus into extinction but the fruits were very delightful one in particular that seemed to be in season all the time i was there a floury thing in a three sided husk was especially good and i made it my staple at first i was puzzled by all these strange fruits and by the strange flowers i saw but later i began to perceive their import however i am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now so soon as my appetite was a little checked i determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine clearly that was the next thing to do the fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon and holding one of these up i began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures i had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning at first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently a fair haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name they had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of amusement however i felt like a schoolmaster amidst children and persisted and presently i had a score of noun substantives at least at my command and then i got to demonstrative pronouns and even the verb to eat but it was slow work and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations so i determined rather of necessity to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found they were before long for i never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts and that was their lack of interest they would come to me with eager cries of astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy the dinner and my conversational beginnings ended i noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone it is odd too how speedily i came to disregard these little people i went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied i was continually meeting more of these men of the future who would follow me a little distance chatter and laugh about me and having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way leave me again to my own devices the calm of evening was upon the world as i emerged from the great hall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun at first things were very confusing everything was so entirely different from the world i had known even the flowers the big building i had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley but the thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present position i resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away from which i could get a wider view of this our planet in the year eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one a.d for that i should explain was the date the little dials of my machine recorded as i walked i was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which i found the world for ruinous it was a little way up the hill for instance was a great heap of granite bound together by masses of aluminium a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda like plants nettles possibly but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves and incapable of stinging it was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure to what end built i could not determine it was here that i was destined at a later date to have a very strange experience the first intimation of a still stranger discovery but of that i will speak in its proper place looking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which i rested for a while i realized that there were no small houses to be seen apparently the single house and possibly even the household had vanished here and there among the greenery were palace like buildings but the house and the cottage which form such characteristic features of our own english landscape had disappeared communism said i to myself and on the heels of that came another thought i looked at the half dozen little figures that were following me then in a flash i perceived that all had the same form of costume the same soft hairless visage and the same girlish rotundity of limb it may seem strange perhaps that i had not noticed this before but everything was so strange now i saw the fact plainly enough in costume and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other these people of the future were alike and the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents i judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious physically at least and i found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion seeing the ease and security in which these people were living i felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman the institution of the family and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force where population is balanced and abundant much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the state where violence comes but rarely and off spring are secure there is less necessity indeed there is no necessity for an efficient family and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their children's needs disappears we see some beginnings of this even in our own time and in this future age it was complete this i must remind you was my speculation at the time later i was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality while i was musing upon these things my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure like a well under a cupola i thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing and then resumed the thread of my speculations there were no large buildings towards the top of the hill and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous i was presently left alone for the first time with a strange sense of freedom and adventure i pushed on up to the crest there i found a seat of some yellow metal that i did not recognize corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss the arm rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins heads i sat down on it and i surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day it was as sweet and fair a view as i have ever seen the sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson below was the valley of the thames in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel i have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery some in ruins and some still occupied here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk there were no hedges no signs of proprietary rights no evidences of agriculture the whole earth had become a garden so watching i began to put my interpretation upon the things i had seen and as it shaped itself to me that evening my interpretation was something in this way afterwards i found i had got only a half truth or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth it seemed to me that i had happened upon humanity upon the wane the ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind for the first time i began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged and yet come to think it is a logical consequence enough strength is the outcome"
