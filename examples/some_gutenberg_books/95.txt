"1" "waste no anxiety on my account i took an early luncheon and having bidden my kind entertainers farewell promising to return to them on my way home i set out to climb the hill that led to the castle and thence to the forest of zenda half an hour's leisurely walking brought me to the castle it had been a fortress in old days and the ancient keep was still in good preservation and very imposing behind it stood another portion of the original castle and behind that again and separated from it by a deep and broad moat which ran all round the old buildings was a handsome modern chateau erected by the last king and now forming the country residence of the duke of strelsau the old and the new portions were connected by a drawbridge and this indirect mode of access formed the only passage between the old building and the outer world but leading to the modern chateau there was a broad and handsome avenue it was an ideal residence when black michael desired company he could dwell in his chateau if a fit of misanthropy seized him he had merely to cross the bridge and draw it up after him it ran on rollers and nothing short of a regiment and a train of artillery could fetch him out i went on my way glad that poor black michael though he could not have the throne or the princess had at least as fine a residence as any prince in europe soon i entered the forest and walked on for an hour or more in its cool sombre shade the great trees enlaced with one another over my head and the sunshine stole through in patches as bright as diamonds and hardly bigger i was enchanted with the place and finding a felled tree trunk propped my back against it and stretching my legs out gave myself up to undisturbed contemplation of the solemn beauty of the woods and to the comfort of a good cigar and when the cigar was finished and i had i suppose inhaled as much beauty as i could i went off into the most delightful sleep regardless of my train to strelsau and of the fast waning afternoon to remember a train in such a spot would have been rank sacrilege instead of that i fell to dreaming that i was married to the princess flavia and dwelt in the castle of zenda and beguiled whole days with my love in the glades of the forest which made a very pleasant dream in fact i was just impressing a fervent kiss on the charming lips of the princess when i heard and the voice seemed at first a part of the dream someone exclaim in rough strident tones why the devil's in it shave him and he'd be the king the idea seemed whimsical enough for a dream by the sacrifice of my heavy moustache and carefully pointed imperial i was to be transformed into a monarch i was about to kiss the princess again when i arrived very reluctantly at the conclusion that i was awake i opened my eyes and found two men regarding me with much curiosity both wore shooting costumes and carried guns one was rather short and very stoutly built with a big bullet shaped head a bristly grey moustache and small pale blue eyes a trifle bloodshot the other was a slender young fellow of middle height dark in complexion and bearing himself with grace and distinction i set the one down as an old soldier the other for a gentleman accustomed to move in good society but not unused to military life either it turned out afterwards that my guess was a good one the elder man approached me beckoning the younger to follow he did so courteously raising his hat i rose slowly to my feet he's the height too i heard the elder murmur as he surveyed my six feet two inches of stature then with a cavalier touch of the cap he addressed me may i ask your name as you have taken the first step in the acquaintance gentlemen said i with a smile suppose you give me a lead in the matter of names the young man stepped forward with a pleasant smile this said he is colonel sapt and i am called fritz von tarlenheim we are both in the service of the king of ruritania i bowed and baring my head answered i am rudolf rassendyll i am a traveller from england and once for a year or two i held a commission from her majesty the queen then we are all brethren of the sword answered tarlenheim holding out his hand which i took readily rassendyll rassendyll muttered colonel sapt then a gleam of intelligence flitted across his face by heaven he cried you're of the burlesdons my brother is now lord burlesdon said i thy head betrayeth thee he chuckled pointing to my uncovered poll why fritz you know the story the young man glanced apologetically at me he felt a delicacy which my sister in law would have admired to put him at his ease i remarked with a smile ah the story is known here as well as among us it seems known cried sapt if you stay here the deuce a man in all ruritania will doubt of it or a woman either i began to feel uncomfortable had i realized what a very plainly written pedigree i carried about with me i should have thought long before i visited ruritania however i was in for it now at this moment a ringing voice sounded from the wood behind us fritz fritz where are you man tarlenheim started and said hastily it's the king old sapt chuckled again then a young man jumped out from behind the trunk of a tree and stood beside us as i looked at him i uttered an astonished cry and he seeing me drew back in sudden wonder saving the hair on my face and a manner of conscious dignity which his position gave him saving also that he lacked perhaps half an inch nay less than that but still something of my height the king of ruritania might have been rudolf rassendyll and i rudolf the king for an instant we stood motionless looking at one another then i bared my head again and bowed respectfully the king found his voice and asked in bewilderment colonel fritz who is this gentleman i was about to answer when colonel sapt stepped between the king and me and began to talk to his majesty in a low growl the king towered over sapt and as he listened his eyes now and again sought mine i looked at him long and carefully the likeness was certainly astonishing though i saw the points of difference also the king's face was slightly more fleshy than mine the oval of its contour the least trifle more pronounced and as i fancied his mouth lacking something of the firmness or obstinacy which was to be gathered from my close shutting lips but for all that and above all minor distinctions the likeness rose striking salient wonderful sapt ceased speaking and the king still frowned then gradually the corners of his mouth began to twitch his nose came down as mine does when i laugh his eyes twinkled and behold he burst into the merriest fit of irrepressible laughter which rang through the woods and proclaimed him a jovial soul well met cousin he cried stepping up to me clapping me on the back and laughing still you must forgive me if i was taken aback a man doesn't expect to see double at this time of day eh fritz i must pray pardon sire for my presumption said i i trust it will not forfeit your majesty's favour by heaven you'll always enjoy the king's countenance he laughed whether i like it or not and sir i shall very gladly add to it what services i can where are you travelling to to strelsau sire to the coronation the king looked at his friends he still smiled though his expression hinted some uneasiness but the humorous side of the matter caught him again fritz fritz he cried a thousand crowns for a sight of brother michael's face when he sees a pair of us and the merry laugh rang out again seriously observed fritz von tarlenheim i question mr rassendyll's wisdom in visiting strelsau just now the king lit a cigarette well sapt said he questioningly he mustn't go growled the old fellow come colonel you mean that i should be in mr rassendyll's debt if oh ay wrap it up in the right way said sapt hauling a great pipe out of his pocket enough sire said i i'll leave ruritania today no by thunder you shan't and that's sans phrase as sapt likes it for you shall dine with me tonight happen what will afterwards come man you don't meet a new relation every day we dine sparingly tonight said fritz von tarlenheim not we with our new cousin for a guest cried the king and as fritz shrugged his shoulders he added oh i'll remember our early start fritz so will i tomorrow morning said old sapt pulling at his pipe o wise old sapt cried the king come mr rassendyll by the way what name did they give you your majesty's i answered bowing well that shows they weren't ashamed of us he laughed come then cousin rudolf i've got no house of my own here but my dear brother michael lends us a place of his and we'll make shift to entertain you there and he put his arm through mine and signing to the others to accompany us walked me off westerly through the forest we walked for more than half an hour and the king smoked cigarettes and chattered incessantly he was full of interest in my family laughed heartily when i told him of the portraits with elphberg hair in our galleries and yet more heartily when he heard that my expedition to ruritania was a secret one you have to visit your disreputable cousin on the sly have you said he suddenly emerging from the wood we came on a small and rude hunting lodge it was a one storey building a sort of bungalow built entirely of wood as we approached it a little man in a plain livery came out to meet us the only other person i saw about the place was a fat elderly woman whom i afterwards discovered to be the mother of johann the duke's keeper well is dinner ready josef asked the king the little servant informed us that it was and we soon sat down to a plentiful meal the fare was plain enough the king ate heartily fritz von tarlenheim delicately old sapt voraciously i played a good knife and fork as my custom is the king noticed my performance with approval we're all good trenchermen we elphbergs said he but what we're eating dry wine josef wine man are we beasts to eat without drinking are we cattle josef at this reproof josef hastened to load the table with bottles remember tomorrow said fritz ay tomorrow said old sapt the king drained a bumper to his cousin rudolf as he was gracious or merry enough to call me and i drank its fellow to the elphberg red whereat he laughed loudly now be the meat what it might the wine we drank was beyond all price or praise and we did it justice fritz ventured once to stay the king's hand what cried the king remember you start before i do master fritz you must be more sparing by two hours than i fritz saw that i did not understand the colonel and i he explained leave here at six we ride down to zenda and return with the guard of honour to fetch the king at eight and then we all ride together to the station hang that same guard growled sapt oh it's very civil of my brother to ask the honour for his regiment said the king come cousin you need not start early another bottle man i had another bottle or rather a part of one for the larger half travelled quickly down his majesty's throat fritz gave up his attempts at persuasion from persuading he fell to being persuaded and soon we were all of us as full of wine as we had any right to be the king began talking of what he would do in the future old sapt of what he had done in the past fritz of some beautiful girl or other and i of the wonderful merits of the elphberg dynasty we all talked at once and followed to the letter sapt's exhortation to let the morrow take care of itself at last the king set down his glass and leant back in his chair i have drunk enough said he far be it from me to contradict the king said i indeed his remark was most absolutely true so far as it went while i yet spoke josef came and set before the king a marvellous old wicker covered flagon it had lain so long in some darkened cellar that it seemed to blink in the candlelight his highness the duke of strelsau bade me set this wine before the king when the king was weary of all other wines and pray the king to drink for the love that he bears his brother well done black michael said the king out with the cork josef hang him did he think i'd flinch from his bottle the bottle was opened and josef filled the king's glass the king tasted it then with a solemnity born of the hour and his own condition he looked round on us gentlemen my friends rudolf my cousin tis a scandalous story rudolf on my honour everything is yours to the half of ruritania but ask me not for a single drop of this divine bottle which i will drink to the health of that that sly knave my brother black michael and the king seized the bottle and turned it over his mouth and drained it and flung it from him and laid his head on his arms on the table and we drank pleasant dreams to his majesty and that is all i remember of the evening perhaps it is enough chapter 4 the king keeps his appointment whether i had slept a minute or a year i knew not i awoke with a start and a shiver my face hair and clothes dripped water and opposite me stood old sapt a sneering smile on his face and an empty bucket in his hand on the table by him sat fritz von tarlenheim pale as a ghost and black as a crow under the eyes i leapt to my feet in anger your joke goes too far sir i cried tut man we've no time for quarrelling nothing else would rouse you it's five o'clock i'll thank you colonel sapt i began again hot in spirit though i was uncommonly cold in body rassendyll interrupted fritz getting down from the table and taking my arm look here the king lay full length on the floor his face was red as his hair and he breathed heavily sapt the disrespectful old dog kicked him sharply he did not stir nor was there any break in his breathing i saw that his face and head were wet with water as were mine we've spent half an hour on him said fritz he drank three times what either of you did growled sapt i knelt down and felt his pulse it was alarmingly languid and slow we three looked at one another was it drugged that last bottle i asked in a whisper i don't know said sapt we must get a doctor there's none within ten miles and a thousand doctors wouldn't take him to strelsau today i know the look of it he'll not move for six or seven hours yet but the coronation i cried in horror fritz shrugged his shoulders as i began to see was his habit on most occasions we must send word that he's ill he said i suppose so said i old sapt who seemed as fresh as a daisy had lit his pipe and was puffing hard at it if he's not crowned today said he i'll lay a crown he's never crowned but heavens why the whole nation's there to meet him half the army ay and black michael at the head shall we send word that the king's drunk that he's ill said i in correction ill echoed sapt with a scornful laugh they know his illnesses too well he's been ill before well we must chance what they think said fritz helplessly i'll carry the news and make the best of it sapt raised his hand tell me said he do you think the king was drugged i do said i and who drugged him that damned hound black michael said fritz between his teeth ay said sapt that he might not come to be crowned rassendyll here doesn't know our pretty michael what think you fritz has michael no king ready has half strelsau no other candidate as god's alive man the throne's lost if the king show himself not in strelsau today i know black michael we could carry him there said i and a very pretty picture he makes sneered sapt fritz von tarlenheim buried his face in his hands the king breathed loudly and heavily sapt stirred him again with his foot the drunken dog he said but he's an elphberg and the son of his father and may i rot in hell before black michael sits in his place for a moment or two we were all silent then sapt knitting his bushy grey brows took his pipe from his mouth and said to me as a man grows old he believes in fate fate sent you here fate sends you now to strelsau i staggered back murmuring good god fritz looked up with an eager bewildered gaze impossible i muttered i should be known it's a risk against a certainty said sapt if you shave i'll wager you'll not be known are you afraid sir come lad there there but it's your life you know if you're known and mine and fritz's here but if you don't go i swear to you black michael will sit tonight on the throne and the king lie in prison or his grave the king would never forgive it i stammered are we women who cares for his forgiveness the clock ticked fifty times and sixty and seventy times as i stood in thought then i suppose a look came over my face for old sapt caught me by the hand crying you'll go yes i'll go said i and i turned my eyes on the prostrate figure of the king on the floor tonight sapt went on in a hasty whisper we are to lodge in the palace the moment they leave us you and i will mount our horses fritz must stay there and guard the king's room and ride here at a gallop the king will be ready josef will tell him and he must ride back with me to strelsau and you ride as if the devil were behind you to the frontier i took it all in in a second and nodded my head there's a chance said fritz with his first sign of hopefulness if i escape detection said i if we're detected said sapt i'll send black michael down below before i go myself so help me heaven sit in that chair man i obeyed him he darted from the room calling josef josef in three minutes he was back and josef with him the latter carried a jug of hot water soap and razors he was trembling as sapt told him how the land lay and bade him shave me suddenly fritz smote on his thigh but the guard they'll know they'll know pooh we shan't wait for the guard we'll ride to hofbau and catch a train there when they come the bird'll be flown but the king the king will be in the wine cellar i'm going to carry him there now if they find him they won't how should they josef will put them off but sapt stamped his foot we're not playing he roared my god don't i know the risk if they do find him he's no worse off than if he isn't crowned today in strelsau so speaking he flung the door open and stooping put forth a strength i did not dream he had and lifted the king in his hands and as he did so the old woman johann the keeper's mother stood in the doorway for a moment she stood then she turned on her heel without a sign of surprise and clattered down the passage has she heard cried fritz i'll shut her mouth said sapt grimly and he bore off the king in his arms for me i sat down in an armchair and as i sat there half dazed josef clipped and scraped me till my moustache and imperial were things of the past and my face was as bare as the king's and when fritz saw me thus he drew a long breath and exclaimed by jove we shall do it it was six o'clock now and we had no time to lose sapt hurried me into the king's room and i dressed myself in the uniform of a colonel of the guard finding time as i slipped on the king's boots to ask sapt what he had done with the old woman she swore she'd heard nothing said he but to make sure i tied her legs together and put a handkerchief in her mouth and bound her hands and locked her up in the coal cellar next door to the king josef will look after them both later on then i burst out laughing and even old sapt grimly smiled i fancy said he that when josef tells them the king is gone they'll think it is because we smelt a rat for you may swear black michael doesn't expect to see him in strelsau today i put the king's helmet on my head old sapt handed me the king's sword looking at me long and carefully thank god he shaved his beard he exclaimed why did he i asked because princess flavia said he grazed her cheek when he was graciously pleased to give her a cousinly kiss come though we must ride is all safe here nothing's safe anywhere said sapt but we can make it no safer fritz now rejoined us in the uniform of a captain in the same regiment as that to which my dress belonged in four minutes sapt had arrayed himself in his uniform josef called that the horses were ready we jumped on their backs and started at a rapid trot the game had begun what would the issue of it be the cool morning air cleared my head and i was able to take in all sapt said to me he was wonderful fritz hardly spoke riding like a man asleep but sapt without another word for the king began at once to instruct me most minutely in the history of my past life of my family of my tastes pursuits weaknesses friends companions and servants he told me the etiquette of the ruritanian court promising to be constantly at my elbow to point out everybody whom i ought to know and give me hints with what degree of favour to greet them by the way he said you're a catholic i suppose not i i answered lord he's a heretic groaned sapt and forthwith he fell to a rudimentary lesson in the practices and observances of the romish faith luckily said he you won't be expected to know much for the king's notoriously lax and careless about such matters but you must be as civil as butter to the cardinal we hope to win him over because he and michael have a standing quarrel about their precedence we were by now at the station fritz had recovered nerve enough to explain to the astonished station master that the king had changed his plans the train steamed up we got into a first class carriage and sapt leaning back on the cushions went on with his lesson i looked at my watch the king's watch it was of course it was just eight i wonder if they've gone to look for us i said i hope they won't find the king said fritz nervously and this time it was sapt who shrugged his shoulders the train travelled well and at half past nine looking out of the window i saw the towers and spires of a great city your capital my liege grinned old sapt with a wave of his hand and leaning forward he laid his finger on my pulse a little too quick said he in his grumbling tone i'm not made of stone i exclaimed you'll do said he with a nod we must say fritz here has caught the ague drain your flask fritz for heaven's sake boy fritz did as he was bid we're an hour early said sapt we'll send word forward for your majesty's arrival for there'll be no one here to meet us yet and meanwhile meanwhile said i the king'll be hanged if he doesn't have some breakfast old sapt chuckled and held out his hand you're an elphberg every inch of you said he then he paused and looking at us said quietly god send we may be alive tonight amen said fritz von tarlenheim the train stopped fritz and sapt leapt out uncovered and held the door for me i choked down a lump that rose in my throat settled my helmet firmly on my head and i'm not ashamed to say it breathed a short prayer to god then i stepped on the platform of the station at strelsau a moment later all was bustle and confusion men hurrying up hats in hand and hurrying off again men conducting me to the buffet men mounting and riding in hot haste to the quarters of the troops to the cathedral to the residence of duke michael even as i swallowed the last drop of my cup of coffee the bells throughout all the city broke out into a joyful peal and the sound of a military band and of men cheering smote upon my ear king rudolf the fifth was in his good city of strelsau and they shouted outside god save the king old sapt's mouth wrinkled into a smile god save em both he whispered courage lad and i felt his hand press my knee chapter 5 the adventures of an understudy with fritz von tarlenheim and colonel sapt close behind me i stepped out of the buffet on to the platform the last thing i did was to feel if my revolver were handy and my sword loose in the scabbard a gay group of officers and high dignitaries stood awaiting me at their head a tall old man covered with medals and of military bearing he wore the yellow and red ribbon of the red rose of ruritania which by the way decorated my unworthy breast also marshal strakencz whispered sapt and i knew that i was in the presence of the most famous veteran of the ruritanian army just behind the marshal stood a short spare man in flowing robes of black and crimson the chancellor of the kingdom whispered sapt the marshal greeted me in a few loyal words and proceeded to deliver an apology from the duke of strelsau the duke it seemed had been afflicted with a sudden indisposition which made it impossible for him to come to the station but he craved leave to await his majesty at the cathedral i expressed my concern accepted the marshal's excuses very suavely and received the compliments of a large number of distinguished personages no one betrayed the least suspicion and i felt my nerve returning and the agitated beating of my heart subsiding but fritz was still pale and his hand shook like a leaf as he extended it to the marshal presently we formed procession and took our way to the door of the station here i mounted my horse the marshal holding my stirrup the civil dignitaries went off to their carriages and i started to ride through the streets with the marshal on my right and sapt who as my chief aide de camp was entitled to the place on my left the city of strelsau is partly old and partly new spacious modern boulevards and residential quarters surround and embrace the narrow tortuous and picturesque streets of the original town in the outer circles the upper classes live in the inner the shops are situated and behind their prosperous fronts lie hidden populous but wretched lanes and alleys filled with a poverty stricken turbulent and in large measure criminal class these social and local divisions corresponded as i knew from sapt's information to another division more important to me the new town was for the king but to the old town michael of strelsau was a hope a hero and a darling the scene was very brilliant as we passed along the grand boulevard and on to the great"
