"1" "there is one of her in every small town let me think business of hand on brow well she always paid eight dollars for her corsets when most girls in a similar position got theirs for fifty nine cents in the basement nature had been kind to her the hair that had been a muddy brown in minnie's schoolgirl days it had touched with a magic red gold wand birdie callahan always said that minnie was working only to wear out her old clothes after the introduction miss wenzel followed jo haley into the lobby she took no pains to lower her voice well i must say mr haley you've got a fine nerve if my gentleman friend was to hear of my working with an ex con i wouldn't be surprised if he'd break off the engagement i should think you'd have some respect for the feelings of a lady with a name to keep up and engaged to a swell fellow like mr schwartz say listen m girl replied jo haley the law don't cover all the tricks but if stuffing an order was a criminal offense i'll bet your swell traveling man would be doing a life term ted worked that day with his teeth set so that his jaws ached next morning minnie wenzel spoke to him only when necessary and then in terms of dollars and cents when dinner time came she divested herself of the black sateen sleevelets wriggled from the shoulders down a la patricia o'brien produced a chamois skin and disappeared in the direction of the washroom ted waited until the dining room was almost deserted then he went in to dinner alone some one in white wearing an absurd little pocket handkerchief of an apron led him to a seat in a far corner of the big room ted did not lift his eyes higher than the snowy square of the apron the apron drew out a chair shoved it under ted's knees in the way aprons have and thrust a printed menu at him roast beef medium said ted without looking up bless your heart yuh ain't changed a bit i remember how yuh used to jaw when it was too well done said the apron fondly ted's head came up with a jerk so yuh will cut yer old friends is it grinned birdie callahan if this wasn't a public dining room maybe yuh'd shake hands with a poor but proud workin girrul yer as good lookin a divil as ever mister ted ted's hand shot out and grasped hers birdie i could weep on your apron i never was so glad to see any one in my life just to look at you makes me homesick what in sam hill are you doing here waitin after yer ma died seemed like i didn't care t work fer no other privit fam'ly so i came back here on my old job i'll bet i'm the homeliest head waitress in captivity ted's nervous fingers were pleating the tablecloth his voice sank to a whisper birdie tell me the god's truth did those three years cause her death niver lied birdie i was with her to the end it started with a cold on th chest have some french fried with yer beef mr teddy they're illigent to day birdie glided off to the kitchen authors are fond of the word glide but you can take it literally this time birdie had a face that looked like a huge mistake but she walked like a panther and they're said to be the last cry as gliders she walked with her chin up and her hips firm that comes from juggling trays you have to walk like that to keep your nose out of the soup after a while the walk becomes a habit any seasoned dining room girl could give lessons in walking to the delsarte teacher of an eastern finishing school from the day that birdie callahan served ted with the roast beef medium and the elegant french fried she appointed herself monitor over his food and clothes and morals i wish i could find words to describe his bitter loneliness he did not seek companionship the men although not directly avoiding him seemed somehow to have pressing business whenever they happened in his vicinity the women ignored him mrs dankworth still dashing and still widowed passed ted one day and looked fixedly at a point one inch above his head in a town like ours the haley house is like a big hospitable clubhouse the men drop in there the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night to hear the gossip and buy a cigar and jolly the girl at the cigar counter ted spoke to them when they spoke to him he began to develop a certain grim line about the mouth jo haley watched him from afar and the longer he watched the kinder and more speculative grew the look in his eyes and slowly and surely there grew in the hearts of our townspeople a certain new respect and admiration for this boy who was fighting his fight ted got into the habit of taking his meals late so that birdie callahan could take the time to talk to him birdie he said one day when she brought his soup do you know that you're the only decent woman who'll talk to me do you know what i mean when i say that i'd give the rest of my life if i could just put my head in my mother's lap and have her muss up my hair and call me foolish names birdie callahan cleared her throat and said abruptly i was noticin yesterday your gray pants needs pressin bad bring em down tomorrow mornin and i'll give em th elegant crease in the laundry so the first weeks went by and the two months of miss wenzel's stay came to an end ted thanked his god and tried hard not to wish that she was a man so that he could punch her head the day before the time appointed for her departure she was closeted with jo haley for a long long time when finally she emerged a bellboy lounged up to ted with a message wenzel says th old man wants t see you s in his office say mr terrill do yuh think they can play to day it's pretty wet jo haley was sunk in the depths of his big leather chair he did not look up as ted entered sit down he said ted sat down and waited puzzled as a wizard at figures mused jo haley at last softly as though to himself i'm a frost a column of figures on paper makes my head swim but i can carry a whole regiment of em in my head i know every time the barkeeper draws one in the dark i've been watchin this thing for the last two weeks hopin you'd quit and come and tell me he turned suddenly and faced ted ted old kid he said sadly what'n'ell made you do it again what's the joke asked ted now ted remonstrated jo haley that way of talkin won't help matters none as i said i'm rotten at figures but you're the first investment that ever turned out bad and let me tell you i've handled some mighty bad smelling ones why kid if you had just come to me on the quiet and asked for the loan of a hundred or so why what's the joke jo said ted again slowly this ain't my notion of a joke came the terse answer we're three hundred short the last vestige of ted terrill's old time radiance seemed to flicker and die leaving him ashen and old short he repeated then my god in a strangely colorless voice my god he looked down at his fingers impersonally as though they belonged to some one else then his hand clutched jo haley's arm with the grip of fear jo jo that's the thing that has haunted me day and night till my nerves are raw the fear of doing it again don't laugh at me will you i used to lie awake nights going over that cursed business of the bank over and over till the cold sweat would break out all over me i used to figure it all out again step by step until jo could a man steal and not know it could thinking of a thing like that drive a man crazy because if it could if it could then i don't know said jo haley but it sounds darned fishy he had a hand on ted's shaking shoulder and was looking into the white drawn face i had great plans for you ted but minnie wenzel's got it all down on slips of paper i might as well call her in again and we'll have the whole blamed thing out minnie wenzel came in her hand were slips of paper and books with figures in them and ted looked and saw things written in his own hand that should not have been there and he covered his shamed face with his two hands and gave thanks that his mother was dead there came three sharp raps at the office door the tense figures within jumped nervously keep out called jo haley whoever you are whereupon the door opened and birdie callahan breezed in get out birdie callahan roared jo you're in the wrong pew birdie closed the door behind her composedly and came farther into the room pete th pasthry cook just tells me that minnie wenzel told th day clerk who told the barkeep who told th janitor who told th chef who told pete that minnie had caught ted stealin some three hundred dollars ted took a quick step forward birdie for heaven's sake keep out of this you can't make things any better you may believe in me but where's the money asked birdie ted stared at her a moment his mouth open ludicrously why i don't know he articulated painfully i never thought of that birdie snorted defiantly i thought so d'ye know sociably i was visitin with my aunt mis mulcahy last evenin there was a quick rustle of silks from minnie wenzel's direction say look here began jo haley impatiently shut up jo haley snapped birdie as i was sayin i was visitin with my aunt mis mulcahy she does fancy washin an ironin for the swells an minnie wenzel there bein none sweller hires her to do up her weddin linens such smears av hand embridery an irish crochet she never see th likes mis mulcahy says and she's seen a lot and as a special treat to the poor owld soul why minnie wenzel lets her see some av her weddin clo'es there never yet was

to where minnie wenzel sat very white and still and pointed a stubby red finger in her face tis the grand manager ye are miss wenzel gettin satins an tailor mades on yer salary it takes a woman minnie wenzel to see through a woman's thricks well i'll be dinged exploded jo haley yuh'd better be retorted birdie callahan minnie wenzel stood up her lip caught between her teeth am i to understand jo haley that you dare to accuse me of taking your filthy money instead of that miserable ex con there who has done time that'll do minnie said jo haley gently that's a plenty prove it went on minnie and then looked as though she wished she hadn't a business college edjication is a grand foine thing observed birdie miss wenzel is a graduate av wan they teach you everything from drawin birds with tail feathers to plain and fancy penmanship in fact they teach everything in the writin line except forgery an i ain't so sure they haven't got a coorse in that i don't care whimpered minnie wenzel suddenly sinking in a limp heap on the floor i had to do it i'm marrying a swell fellow and a girl's got to have some clothes that don't look like a bird center dressmaker's work he's got three sisters i saw their pictures and they're coming to the wedding they're the kind that wear low necked dresses in the evening and have their hair and nails done downtown i haven't got a thing but my looks could i go to new york dressed like a rube on the square jo i worked here six years and never took a sou but things got away from me the tailor wouldn't finish my suit unless i paid him fifty dollars down i only took fifty at first intending to pay it back honest to goodness jo i did cut it out said jo haley and get up i was going to give you a check for your wedding though i hadn't counted on no three hundred we'll call it square and i hope you'll be happy but i don't gamble on it you'll be goin through your man's pants pockets before you're married a year you can take your hat and fade i'd like to know how i'm ever going to square this thing with ted and birdie an me standin here gassin while them fool girls in the dinin room can't set a table decent and dinner in less than

i can't tell you how grateful i am this is no place to talk to you will you let me walk home with you to night after your work's done will i said birdie turning to face him i will not th swell mob has

next week inside half a year if yuh was lonesome enough yuh'd ask me to marry yuh and b'gorra she said softly looking down at her unlovely red hands i'm dead scared i'd do it get back to work ted terrill and hold yer head up high and when yuh say your prayers to night thank your lucky stars i ain't a hussy iii what she wore somewhere in your story you must pause to describe your heroine's costume it is a ticklish task the average reader likes his heroine well dressed he is not satisfied with knowing that she looked like a tall fair lily he wants to be told that her gown was of green crepe with lace ruffles that swirled at her feet writers used to go so far as to name the dressmaker and it was a poor kind of a heroine who didn't wear a red velvet by worth but that has been largely abandoned in these days of commissions still when the heroine goes out on the terrace to spoon after dinner a quaint old english custom for the origin of which see any novel by the duchess page 179 the average reader wants to know what sort of a filmy wrap she snatches up on the way out he demands a description with as many illustrations as the publisher will stand for of what she wore from the bedroom to the street with full stops for the ribbons on her robe de nuit and the buckles on her ballroom slippers half the poor creatures one sees flattening their noses against the shop windows are authors getting a line on the advance fashions suppose a careless writer were to dress his heroine in a full plaited skirt only to find when his story is published four months later that full plaited skirts have been relegated to the dim past i started to read a story once it was a good one there was in it not a single allusion to brandy and soda or divorce or the stock market the dialogue crackled the hero talked like a live man it was a shipboard story and the heroine was charming so long as she wore her heavy ulster but along toward evening she blossomed forth in a yellow gown with a scarlet poinsettia at her throat i quit her cold nobody ever wore a scarlet poinsettia or if they did they couldn't wear it on a yellow gown or if they did wear it with a yellow gown they didn't wear it at the throat scarlet poinsettias aren't worn anyhow to this day i don't know whether the heroine married the hero or jumped overboard you see one can't be too careful about clothing one's heroine i hesitate to describe sophy epstein's dress you won't like it in the first place it was cut too low front and back for a shoe clerk in a downtown loft it was a black dress near princess in style very tight as to fit very short as to skirt very sleazy as to material it showed all the delicate curves of sophy's under fed girlish body and sophy didn't care a bit its most objectionable feature was at the throat collarless gowns were in vogue sophy's daring shears had gone a snip or two farther they had cut a startlingly generous v to say that the dress was elbow sleeved is superfluous i have said that sophy clerked in a downtown loft sophy sold sample shoes at two fifty a pair and from where you were standing you thought they looked just like the shoes that were sold in the regular shops for six when sophy sat on one of the low benches at the feet of some customer tugging away at a refractory shoe for a would be small foot her shameless little gown exposed more than it should have but few of sophy's customers were shocked they were mainly chorus girls and ladies of doubtful complexion in search of cheap and ultra footgear and to use a health term hardened by exposure have i told you how pretty she was she was so pretty that you immediately forgave her the indecency of her pitiful little gown she was pretty in a daringly demure fashion like a wicked little puritan or a poverty stricken cleo de merode with her smooth brown hair parted in the middle drawn severely down over her ears framing the lovely oval of her face and ending in a simple coil at the neck some serpent's wisdom had told sophy to eschew puffs but i think her prettiness could have triumphed even over those if sophy's boss had been any other sort of man he would have informed sophy sternly that black princess effects cut low were not au fait in the shoe clerk world but sophy's boss had a rhombic nose and no instep and the tail of his name had been amputated he didn't care how sophy wore her dresses so long as she sold shoes once the boss had kissed sophy not on the mouth but just where her shabby gown formed its charming but immodest v sophy had slapped him of course but the slap had not set the thing right in her mind she could not forget it it had made her uncomfortable in much the same way as we are wildly ill at ease when we dream of walking naked in a crowded street at odd moments during the day sophy had found herself rubbing the spot furiously with her unlovely handkerchief and shivering a little she had never told the other girls about that kiss so there you have sophy and her costume you may take her or leave her i purposely placed these defects in costuming right at the beginning of the story so that there should be no false pretenses one more detail about sophy's throat was a slender near gold chain from which was suspended a cheap and glittering la valliere sophy had not intended it as a sop to the conventions it was an offering on the shrine of fashion and represented many lunchless days at eleven o'clock one august morning louie came to chicago from oskaloosa iowa there was no hay in his hair the comic papers have long insisted that the country boy on his first visit to the city is known by his greased boots and his high water pants don't you believe them the small town boy is as fastidious about the height of his heels and the stripe of his shift and the roll of his hat brim as are his city brothers he peruses the slangily worded ads of the classy clothes tailors and when scarlet cravats are worn the small town boy is not more than two weeks late in acquiring one that glows like a headlight louie found a rooming house shoved his suitcase under the bed changed his collar washed his hands in the gritty water of the wash bowl and started out to look for a job louie was twenty one for the last four years he had been employed in the best shoe store at home and he knew shoe leather from the factory to the ash barrel it was almost a religion with him curiosity which plays leads in so many life dramas led louie to the rotunda of the tallest building it was built on the hollow center plan with a sheer drop from the twenty somethingth to the main floor louie stationed himself in the center of the mosaic floor took off his hat bent backward almost double and gazed his mouth wide open when he brought his muscles slowly back into normal position he tried hard not to look impressed he glanced about sheepishly to see if any one was laughing at him and his eye encountered the electric lighted glass display case of the shoe company upstairs the case was filled with pink satin slippers and cunning velvet boots and the newest thing in bronze street shoes louie took the next elevator up the shoe display had made him feel as though some one from home had slapped him on the back the god of the jobless was with him the boss had fired two boys the day before oskaloosa grinned the boss derisively do they wear shoes there what do you know about shoes huh boy louie told him the boss shuffled the papers on his desk and chewed his cigar and tried not to show his surprise louie quite innocently was teaching the boss things about the shoe business when louie had finished well i try you anyhow the boss grunted grudgingly i give you so and so much he named a wage that would have been ridiculous if it had not been so pathetic all right sir answered louie promptly like the boys in the alger series the cost of living problem had never bothered louie in oskaloosa the boss hid a pleased smile miss epstein he bellowed step this way miss epstein kindly show this here young man so he gets a line on the stock he is from oskaloosa ioway look out she don't sell you a gold brick louie but louie was not listening he was gazing at the v in sophy epstein's dress with all his scandalized oskaloosa iowa eyes louie was no mollycoddle but he had been in great demand as usher at the young men's sunday evening club service at the congregational church and in his town there had been no sophy epsteins in too tight princess dresses cut into a careless v but sophy was a city product i was about to say pure and simple but i will not wise bold young old underfed overworked and triumphantly pretty how do cooed sophy in her best baby tones louie's disapproving eyes jumped from the objectionable v in sophy's dress to the lure of sophy's face and their expression underwent a lightning change there was no disapproving sophy's face no matter how long one had dwelt in oskaloosa i won't bite you said sophy i'm never vicious on tuesdays we'll start here with the misses an children's and work over to the other side whereupon louie was introduced into the intricacies of the sample shoe business he kept his eyes resolutely away from the v and learned many things he learned how shoes that look like six dollar values may be sold for two fifty he looked on in wide eyed horror while sophy fitted a no 5 c shoe on a 6 b foot and assured the wearer that it looked like a made to order boot he picked up a pair of dull kid shoes and looked at them his leather wise eyes saw much and i think he would have taken his hat off the hook and his offended business principles out of the shop forever if sophy had not completed her purchase and strolled over to him at the psychological moment she smiled up at him impudently well pink cheeks she said how do you like our little settlement by the lake huh these shoes aren't worth two fifty said louie indignation in his voice well sure replied sophy i know it what do you think this is a charity bazaar but back home began louie hotly ferget it kid said sophy this is a big town but it ain't got no room for back homers don't sour on one job till you've got another nailed you'll find yourself cuddling down on a park bench if you do say are you honestly from oskaloosa i certainly am answered louie with pride my goodness ejaculated sophy i never believed there was no such place don't brag about it to the other fellows what time do you go out for lunch asked louie what's it to you with the accent on the to when i want to know a thing i generally ask explained louie gently sophy looked at him a long keen knowing look you'll learn she observed thoughtfully louie did learn he learned so much in that first week that when sunday came it seemed as though aeons had passed over his head he learned that the crime of murder was as nothing compared to the crime of allowing a customer to depart shoeless he learned that the lunch hour was invented for the purpose of making dates that no one had ever heard of oskaloosa iowa that seven dollars a week does not leave much margin for laundry and general recklessness that a madonna face above a v cut gown is apt to distract one's attention from shoes that a hundred dollar nest egg is as effective in chicago as a pine stick would be in propping up a stone wall and that all the other men clerks called sophy sweetheart some of his newly acquired knowledge brought pain as knowledge is apt to do he saw that state street was crowded with sophys during the noon hour girls with lovely faces under pitifully absurd hats girls who aped the fashions of the dazzling creatures they saw stepping from limousines girls who starved body and soul in order to possess a set of false curls or a pair of black satin shoes with mother o pearl buttons girls whose minds were bounded on the north by the nickel theatres on the east by i sez to him on the south by the gorgeous shop windows and on the west by he sez t me oh i can't tell you how much louie learned in that first week while his eyes were getting accustomed to the shifting jostling pushing giggling walking talking throng the city is justly famed as a hot house of forced knowledge one thing louie could not learn he could not bring himself to accept the v in sophy's dress louie's mother had been one of the old fashioned kind who wore a blue and white checked gingham apron from 6 a.m to 2 p.m when she took it off to go downtown and help the ladies of the church at the cake sale in the empty window of the gas company's office only to don it again when she fried the potatoes for supper among other things she had taught louie to wipe his feet before coming in to respect and help women and to change his socks often after a month of chicago louie forgot the first lesson had more difficulty than i can tell you in reverencing a woman who only said aw don't get fresh now when the other men put their"
