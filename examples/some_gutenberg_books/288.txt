"1" "literary are entirely too prone to too much long faced prattle about literature which when all is said is never a controlling factor in anybody's life the automobile and the telephone the accomplishments of mr edison and mr burbank and it would be permissible to add of mr rockefeller influence nowadays in one fashion or another every moment of every living american's existence whereas had america produced instead a second milton or a dante it would at most have caused a few of us to spend a few spare evenings rather differently besides we know even we average novel readers that america is in fact producing her enduring literature day by day although as rarely fails to be the case those who are contemporaneous with the makers of this literature cannot with any certainty point them out to voice a hoary truism time alone is the test of vitality in our present flood of books as in any other flood it is the froth and scum which shows most prominently and the possession of vitality here as elsewhere postulates that its possessor must ultimately perish nay by the time these printed pages are first read as printed pages allusion to those modern authors whom these pages cite the pre eminent literary personages of that hour wherein these pages were written will inevitably have come to savor somewhat of antiquity so that sundry references herein to the vital books now most in vogue will rouse much that vague shrugging recollection as wakens say at a mention of _dorothy vernon_ or _three weeks_ or _beverly of graustark_ and while at first glance it might seem expedient in revising the last proof sheets of these pages somewhat to freshen them up by substituting for the books herein referred to the vital and more widely talked of novels of the summer of 1916 the task would be but wasted labor since even these fascinating chronicles one comprehends forlornly must needs be equally obsolete by the time these proof sheets have been made into a volume with malice aforethought therefore the books and authors named herein stay those which all of three years back our reviewers and advertising pages with perfect gravity acclaimed as of enduring importance for the quaintness of that opinion nowadays may profitably round the moral that there is really nothing whereto one may fittingly compare a successful contribution to vital reading matter as touches evanescence and this is as it should be _tout passe l'art robust seul a l'eternite_ precisely as gautier points out with bracing common sense and it is excellent thus to comprehend that to day as always only through exercise of the auctorial virtues of distinction and clarity of beauty and symmetry of tenderness and truth and urbanity may a man in reason attempt to insure his books against oblivion's voracity yet the desire to write perfectly of beautiful happenings is as the saying runs old as the hills and as immortal questionless there was many a serviceable brick wasted in nineveh because finicky persons must needs be deleting here and there a phrase in favor of its cuneatic synonym and it is not improbable that when the outworn sun expires in clinkers its final ray will gild such zealots tinkering with their style this then is the conclusion of the whole matter some few there must be in every age and every land of whom life claims nothing very insistently save that they write perfectly of beautiful happenings and even we average novel readers know it is such folk who are to day making in america that portion of our literature which may hope for permanency dumbarton grange 1914 1916 belhs cavaliers _for this raimbaut de vaquieras lived at a time when prolonged habits of extra mundane contemplation combined with the decay of real knowledge were apt to volatilize the thoughts and aspirations of the best and wisest into dreamy unrealities and to lend a false air of mysticism to love it is as if the intellect and the will had become used to moving paralytically among visions dreams and mystic terrors weighed down with torpor fair friend since that hour i took leave of thee i have not slept nor stirred from off my knee but prayed alway to god s mary's son to give me back my true companion and soon it will be dawn fair friend at parting thy behest to me was that all sloth i should eschew and flee and keep good watch until the night was done now must my song and service pass for none for soon it will be dawn raimbaut de vaquieras _aubade from f york powell's version_ belhs cavaliers you may read elsewhere of the long feud that was between guillaume de baux afterward prince of orange and his kinsman raimbaut de vaquieras they were not reconciled until their youth was dead then when messire raimbaut returned from battling against the turks and the bulgarians in the 1,210th year from man's salvation the archbishop of rheims made peace between the two cousins and attended by makrisi a converted saracen who had followed the knight's fortunes for well nigh a quarter of a century the sire de vaquieras rode homeward many slain men were scattered along the highway when he came again into venaissin in april after an absence of thirty years the crows whom his passing disturbed were too sluggish for long flights and many of them did not heed him at all guillaume de baux was now undisputed master of these parts although as this host of mute hacked and partially devoured witnesses attested the contest had been dubious for a while but now lovain of the great tooth prince guillaume's last competitor was captured the forces of lovain were scattered and of lovain's lieutenants only mahi de vernoil was unsubdued prince guillaume laughed a little when he told his kinsman of the posture of affairs as more loudly did guillaume's gross son sire philibert but madona biatritz did not laugh she was the widow of guillaume's dead brother prince conrat whom guillaume succeeded and it was in her honor that raimbaut had made those songs which won him eminence as a practitioner of the gay science biatritz said it is a long while since we two met he that had been her lover all his life said yes she was no longer the most beautiful of women no longer his be hymned belhs cavaliers you may read elsewhere how he came to call her that in all his canzons but only a fine and gracious stranger it was uniformly gray that soft and plentiful hair where once such gold had flamed as dizzied him to think of even now there was no crimson in these thinner lips and candor would have found her eyes less wonderful than those raimbaut had dreamed of very often among an alien and hostile people but he lamented nothing and to him she was as ever heaven's most splendid miracle yes said this old raimbaut and even to day we have not reclaimed the sepulcher as yet oh i doubt if we shall ever win it now that your brother and my most dear lord is dead both thought a while of boniface de montferrat their playmate once who yesterday was king of thessalonica and now was so much macedonian dust she said this week the prince sent envoys to my nephew and so you have come home again color had surged into her time worn face and as she thought of things done long ago this woman's eyes were like the eyes of his young biatritz she said you never married he answered no i have left love alone for love prefers to take rather than to give against a single happy hour he balances a hundred miseries and he appraises one pleasure to be worth a thousand pangs pardieu let this immortal usurer contrive as may seem well to him for i desire no more of his bounty or of his penalties no we wish earnestly for nothing either good or bad said dona biatritz we who have done with loving they sat in silence musing over ancient happenings and not looking at each other until the prince came with his guests who seemed to laugh too heartily guillaume's frail arm was about his kinsman and guillaume chuckled over jests and by words that had been between the cousins as children raimbaut found them no food for laughter now guillaume told all of raimbaut's oath of fealty and of how these two were friends and their unnatural feud was forgotten for we grow old eh maker of songs he said and it is time we made our peace with heaven since we are not long for this world yes said the knight oh yes we both grow old he thought of another april evening so long ago when this guillaume de baux had stabbed him in a hedged field near calais and had left him under a hawthorn bush for dead and raimbaut wondered that there was no anger in his heart we are friends now he said biatritz whom these two had loved and whose vanished beauty had been the spur of their long enmity sat close to them and hardly seemed to listen thus the evening passed and every one was merry because the prince had overcome lovain of the great tooth and was to punish the upstart on the morrow but raimbaut de vaquieras a spent fellow a derelict barren of aim now that the holy wars were over sat in this unfamiliar place where when he was young he had laughed as a cock crows and thought how at the last he had crept home to die as a dependent on his cousin's bounty thus the evening passed and at its end makrisi followed the troubadour to his regranted fief of vaquieras this was a chill and brilliant night swayed by a frozen moon so powerful that no stars showed in the unclouded heavens and everywhere the bogs were curdled with thin ice an obdurate wind swept like a knife blade across a world which even in its spring seemed very old this night is bleak and evil makrisi said he rode a coffin's length behind his master it is like prince guillaume i think what man will sorrow when dawn comes raimbaut de vaquieras replied always dawn comes at last makrisi it comes the more quickly messire when it is prompted the troubadour only smiled at words which seemed so meaningless he did not smile when later in the night makrisi brought mahi de vernoil disguised as a mendicant friar this outlaw pleaded with sire raimbaut to head the tatters of lovain's army and showed raimbaut how easy it would be to wrest venaissin from prince guillaume we cannot save lovain de vemoil said for guillaume has him fast but venaissin is very proud of you my tres beau sire ho maker of world famous songs stout champion of the faith my men and i will now make you prince of orange in place of the fiend who rules us you may then at your convenience wed madona biatritz that most amiable lady whom you have loved so long and by the cross you may do this before the week is out the old knight answered it is true that i have always served madona biatritz who is of matchless worth i might not therefore presume to call myself any longer her servant were my honor stained in any particular oh no messire de vernoil an oath is an oath i have this day sworn fealty to guillaume de baux then after other talk raimbaut dismissed the fierce eyed little man the freebooter growled curses as he went on a sudden he whistled like a person considering and he began to chuckle raimbaut said more lately zoraida left no wholesome legacy in you makrisi this zoraida was a woman the knight had known in constantinople a comely outlander who had killed herself because of sire raimbaut's highflown avoidance of all womankind except the mistress of his youth nay save only in loving you too well messire was zoraida a wise woman notably but this is outworn talk the prattle of cain's babyhood as matters were you did not love zoraida so zoraida died such is the custom in my country you trouble me makrisi your eyes are like blown coals yet you have served me long and faithfully you know that mine was ever the vocation of dealing honorably in battle among emperors and of spreading broadcast the rumor of my valor and of achieving good by my sword's labors i have lived by warfare long long ago since i derived no benefit from love i cried farewell to it ay said makrisi love makes a demi god of all just for an hour such hours as follow we devote to the concoction of sleeping draughts he laughed and very harshly and raimbaut did not sleep that night because this life of ours seemed such a piece of tangle work as he had not the skill to unravel so he devoted the wakeful hours to composition of a planh lamenting vanished youth and that biatritz whom the years had stolen then on the ensuing morning after some talk about the new campaign prince guillaume de baux leaned back in his high chair and said abruptly in perfect candor you puzzle your liege lord for you loathe me and you still worship my sister in law an unattainable princess in these two particulars you display such wisdom as would inevitably prompt you to make an end of me yet what the devil you the time battered vagabond decline happiness and a kingdom to boot because of yesterday's mummery in the cathedral because of a mere promise given yes i have my spies in every rat hole i am aware that my barons hate me and hate philibert almost as bitterly and that in fine a majority of my barons would prefer to see you prince in my unstable place on account of your praiseworthy molestations of heathenry oh yes i understand my barons perfectly i flatter myself i understand everybody in venaissin save you raimbaut answered you and i are not alike no praise each and every saint said the prince of orange heartily and yet i am not sure he rose for his sight had failed him so that he could not distinctly see you except when he spoke with head thrown back as though he looked at you over a wall for instance do you understand that i hold biatritz here as a prisoner because her dower lands are necessary to me and that i intend to marry her as soon as pope innocent grants me a dispensation all venaissin knows that yes you have always gained everything which you desired in this world guillaume yet it was at a price i think i am no haggler but you have never comprehended me not even in the old days when we loved each other for instance do you understand slave of a spoken word what it must mean to me to know that at this hour to morrow there will be alive in venaissin no person whom i hate messire de vaquieras reflected his was never a rapid mind why no i do not know anything about hatred he said at last i think i never hated any person guillaume de baux gave a half frantic gesture now heaven send you troubadours a clearer understanding of what sort of world we live in he broke off short and growled and yet sometimes i envy you raimbaut they rode then into the square of st michel to witness the death of lovain guillaume took with him his two new mistresses and all his by blows each magnificently clothed as if they rode to a festival afterward before the doors of lovain's burning house a rope was fastened under lovain's armpits and he was gently lowered into a pot of boiling oil his feet cooked first and then the flesh of his legs and so on upward while lovain screamed guillaume in a loose robe of green powdered with innumerable silver crescents sat watching under a canopy woven very long ago in tarshish and cunningly embroidered with the figures of peacocks and apes and men with eagles heads his hands caressed each other meditatively it was on the afternoon of this day the last of april that sire raimbaut came upon madona biatritz about a strange employment in the ladies court there was then a well in the midst of this enclosure with a granite ledge around it carven with lilies and upon this she leaned looking down into the water in her lap was a rope of pearls which one by one she unthreaded and dropped into the well clear and warm the weather was without forests were quickening branch by branch as though a green flame smoldered from one bough to another violets peeped about the roots of trees and all the world was young again but here was only stone beneath their feet and about them showed the high walls and the lead sheathed towers and the parapets and the sunk windows of guillaume's chateau there was no color anywhere save gray and raimbaut and biatritz were aging people now it seemed to him that they were the wraiths of those persons who had loved each other at montferrat and that the walls about them and the leaden devils who grinned from every waterspout and all those dark and narrow windows were only part of some magic picture such as a sorceress may momentarily summon out of smoke wreaths as he had seen zoraida do very long ago this woman might have been a wraith in verity for she was clothed throughout in white save for the ponderous gold girdle about her middle a white gorget framed the face which was so pinched and shrewd and strange and she peered into the well smiling craftily i was thinking death was like this well said biatritz without any cessation of her singular employment so dark that we may see nothing clearly save one faint gleam which shows us or which seems to show us where rest is yes yes this is that chaplet which you won in the tournament at montferrat when we were young pearls are the symbol of tears we read but we had no time for reading then no time for anything except to be quite happy you saw this morning's work raimbaut were satan to go mad he would be such a fiend as this guillaume de baux who is our master ay the man is as cruel as my old opponent mourzoufle sire raimbaut answered with a patient shrug it is a great mystery why such persons should win all which they desire of this world we can but recognize that it is for some sufficient reason then he talked with her concerning the aforementioned infamous emperor of the east against whom the old knight had fought and of enrico dandolo and of king boniface dead brother to madona biatritz and of much remote outlandish adventuring oversea of zoraida he did not speak and biatritz in turn told him of that one child which she had borne her husband prince conrat a son who died in infancy and she spoke of this dead baby who living would have been their monarch with a sweet quietude that wrung the old knight's heart thus these spent people sat and talked for a long while the talk veering anywhither just as chance directed blurred gusts of song and laughter would come to them at times from the hall where guillaume de baux drank with his courtiers and these would break the tranquil flow of speech then unvexedly the gentle voice of the speaker were it his or hers would resume she said they laugh we are not merry no he replied i am not often merry there was a time when love and its service kept me in continuous joy as waters invest a fish i woke from a high dream and then but for the fear of seeming cowardly i would have extinguished my life as men blow out a candle vanity preserved me sheer vanity he shrugged spreading his hard lean hands belhs cavaliers i grudged my enemies the pleasure of seeing me forgetful of valor and noble enterprises and so since then i have served heaven in default of you i would not have it otherwise she said half as in wonder i would not have you be quite sane like other men and i believe she added still with her wise smile you have derived a deal of comfort off and on from being heart broken he replied gravely a man may always if he will but take the pains be tolerably content and rise in worth and yet dispense with love he has only to guard himself against baseness and concentrate his powers on doing right thus therefore when fortune failed me i persisted in acting to the best of my ability though i had lost my lands and my loved lady i must hold fast to my own worth without a lady and without acreage it was yet in my power to live a cleanly and honorable life and i did not wish to make two evils out of one assuredly i would not have you be quite sane like other men she repeated it would seem that you have somehow blundered through long years preserving always the ignorance of a child and the blindness of a child i cannot understand how this is possible nor can i keep from smiling at your high flown notions and yet i envy you raimbaut thus the afternoon passed and the rule of prince guillaume was made secure his supper was worthily appointed for guillaume loved color and music and beauty of every kind and was on this the day of his triumph in a prodigal humor many lackeys in scarlet brought in the first course to the sound of exultant drums and pipes with a blast of trumpets and a waving of banners so that all hearts were uplifted and guillaume jested with harsh laughter but raimbaut de vaquieras was not mirthful for he was remembering a boy whom he had known of very long ago he was swayed by an odd fancy as the men sat over their wine and jongleurs sang and performed tricks for their diversion that this boy so frank and excellent as yet existed somewhere and that the raimbaut who moved these shriveled hands before him on the table there was only a sad dream of what had never been it troubled him too to see how grossly these soldiers ate for as a person of refinement an associate of monarchs sire raimbaut when the dishes were passed picked up his meats between the index and the middle finger of his left hand and esteemed it infamous manners to dip any other fingers into the gravy guillaume had left the warriors hall philibert was drunk and half the men at arms were snoring among the rushes when at the height of their festivity makrisi came he plucked his master by the sleeve a swarthy bearded angevin was singing his song was one of old sire raimbaut's famous canzons in honor of belhs cavaliers the knave was singing blithely _pus mos belhs cavaliers grazitz_ _e joys m'es lunhatz e faiditz _don no m venra jamais conortz _fer qu'ees mayer l'ira e plus fortz the saracen had said nothing he showed a jeweled dagger and the knight arose and followed him out of that uproarious hall raimbaut was bitterly perturbed though he did not know for what reason as makrisi led him through dark corridors to the dull gleaming arras of prince guillaume's apartments in this corridor was an iron lamp swung from the ceiling and now as this lamp swayed slightly and burned low the tiny flame leaped clear of the wick and was extinguished and darkness rose about them raimbaut said what do you want of me whose blood is on that knife have you forgotten it is walburga's eve makrisi said raimbaut did not regret he could not see his servant's countenance time was we named it otherwise and praised another woman than a saxon wench but let the new name stand it is walburga's eve that little little hour of evil and all over the world surges the full tide of hell's desire and mischief is a making now apace apace apace people moan in their sleep and many pillows are pricked by needles that have sewed a shroud cry _eman hetan_ now messire for there are those to night who find the big cathedrals of your red roofed christian towns no more imposing than so many pimples on a butler's chin because they ride so high so very high in this brave moonlight full tide full tide makrisi said and his voice jangled like a bell as he drew aside the curtain so that the old knight saw into the room beyond it was a place of many lights which when thus suddenly disclosed blinded him at first then raimbaut perceived guillaume lying a sprawl across an oaken chest the prince had fallen backward and lay in this posture glaring at the intruders with horrible eyes which did not move and would not ever move again his breast was crimson for some one had stabbed him a woman stood above the corpse and lighted yet another candle while raimbaut de vaquieras waited motionless a hand meant only to bestow caresses brushed a lock of hair from this woman's eyes while he waited the movements of this hand were not uncertain but only quivered somewhat as a taut wire shivers in the wind while raimbaut de vaquieras waited motionless i must have lights i must have a host of candles to assure me past any questioning that he is dead the man is of deep cunning i think he is not dead even now lightly biatritz touched the prince's breast strange that this wicked heart should be so tranquil when there is murder here to make it glad nay very certainly this guillaume de baux will rise and laugh in his old fashion before he speaks and then i shall be afraid but i am not afraid as yet i am afraid of nothing save the dark for one cannot be merry in the dark raimbaut said this is belhs cavaliers whom i have loved my whole life through therefore i do not doubt pardieu i do not even doubt who know she is of matchless worth wherein have i done wrong raimbaut she came to him with fluttering hands why but look you the man had laid an ambuscade in the marsh and he meant to kill you there to night as you rode for vaquieras he told me of it told me how it was for that end alone he lured you into venaissin again she brushed the hair back from her forehead raimbaut i spoke of god and knightly honor and the man laughed no i think it was a fiend who sat so long beside the window yonder whence one may see the marsh there were no candles in the room the moonlight was upon his evil face and i could think of nothing of nothing that has been since adam's time except our youth raimbaut and he smiled fixedly like a white image because my misery amused him only when i tried to go to you to warn you he leaped up stiffly making a mewing noise he caught me by the throat so that i could not scream then while we struggled in the moonlight your makrisi came and stabbed him nay i but fetched this knife messire makrisi seemed to love that bloodied knife biatritz proudly said the man lies raimbaut what need to tell me that belhs cavaliers and the saracen shrugged it is very true i lie he said as among friends i may confess i killed the prince but for the rest take notice both of you i mean to lie intrepidly raimbaut remembered how his mother had given each of two lads an apple and he had clamored for guillaume's as children do and guillaume had changed with him it was a trivial happening to remember after fifty years but guillaume was dead and this hacked flesh was raimbaut's flesh in part and the thought of raimbaut would never trouble guillaume de baux any more in addition there was a fire of juniper wood and frankincense upon the hearth and the room smelt too cloyingly of be drugging sweetness then on the walls were tapestries which depicted merlin's dream so that everywhere recoiling women smiled with bold eyes and here their wantonness seemed out of place listen makrisi was saying listen for the hour strikes at last at last he cried with a shrill whine of malice raimbaut said dully oh i do not understand and yet zoraida loved you once loved you as people love where i was born the saracen's voice had altered his speech was like the rustle of papers you did not love zoraida and so it came about that upon walburga's eve at midnight zoraida hanged herself beside your doorway thus we love where i was born and i i cut the rope with my left hand i had my other arm about that frozen thing which yesterday had been zoraida you understand so that it might not fall and in the act a tear dropped from that dead woman's cheek and wetted my"
