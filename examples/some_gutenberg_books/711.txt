"1" "for eight months and reached mackenzie's place as i heard dying that's all i know and if you ask me i believe that it is a lie but if you want to find out more about it you had better go up the tana to mackenzie's place and ask him for information sir henry and i looked at each other here was something tangible i think that we will go to mr mackenzie's i said well answered the consul that is your best way but i warn you that you are likely to have a rough journey for i hear that the masai are about and as you know they are not pleasant customers your best plan will be to choose a few picked men for personal servants and hunters and to hire bearers from village to village it will give you an infinity of trouble but perhaps on the whole it will prove a cheaper and more advantageous course than engaging a caravan and you will be less liable to desertion fortunately there were at lamu at this time a party of wakwafi askari soldiers the wakwafi who are a cross between the masai and the wataveta are a fine manly race possessing many of the good qualities of the zulu and a great capacity for civilization they are also great hunters as it happened these particular men had recently been on a long trip with an englishman named jutson who had started from mombasa a port about 150 miles below lamu and journeyed right round kilimanjaro one of the highest known mountains in africa poor fellow he had died of fever when on his return journey and within a day's march of mombasa it does seem hard that he should have gone off thus when within a few hours of safety and after having survived so many perils but so it was his hunters buried him and then came on to lamu in a dhow our friend the consul suggested to us that we had better try and hire these men and accordingly on the following morning we started to interview the party accompanied by an interpreter in due course we found them in a mud hut on the outskirts of the town three of the men were sitting outside the hut and fine frank looking fellows they were having a more or less civilized appearance to them we cautiously opened the object of our visit at first with very scant success they declared that they could not entertain any such idea that they were worn and weary with long travelling and that their hearts were sore at the loss of their master they meant to go back to their homes and rest awhile this did not sound very promising so by way of effecting a diversion i asked where the remainder of them were i was told there were six and i saw but three one of the men said they slept in the hut and were yet resting after their labours sleep weighed down their eyelids and sorrow made their hearts as lead it was best to sleep for with sleep came forgetfulness but the men should be awakened presently they came out of the hut yawning the first two men being evidently of the same race and style as those already before us but the appearance of the third and last nearly made me jump out of my skin he was a very tall broad man quite six foot three i should say but gaunt with lean wiry looking limbs my first glance at him told me that he was no wakwafi he was a pure bred zulu he came out with his thin aristocratic looking hand placed before his face to hide a yawn so i could only see that he was a keshla or ringed man endnote 1 and that he had a great three cornered hole in his forehead in another second he removed his hand revealing a powerful looking zulu face with a humorous mouth a short woolly beard tinged with grey and a pair of brown eyes keen as a hawk's i knew my man at once although i had not seen him for twelve years how do you do umslopogaas i said quietly in zulu the tall man who among his own people was commonly known as the woodpecker and also as the slaughterer started and almost let the long handled battleaxe he held in his hand fall in his astonishment next second he had recognized me and was saluting me in an outburst of sonorous language which made his companions the wakwafi stare koos chief he began koos y pagete koos y umcool chief from of old mighty chief koos baba father macumazahn old hunter slayer of elephants eater up of lions clever one watchful one brave one quick one whose shot never misses who strikes straight home who grasps a hand and holds it to the death i.e is a true friend koos baba wise is the voice of our people that says mountain never meets with mountain but at daybreak or at even man shall meet again with man behold a messenger came up from natal macumazahn is dead cried he the land knows macumazahn no more that is years ago and now behold now in this strange place of stinks i find macumazahn my friend there is no room for doubt the brush of the old jackal has gone a little grey but is not his eye as keen and are not his teeth as sharp ha ha macumazahn mindest thou how thou didst plant the ball in the eye of the charging buffalo mindest thou i had let him run on thus because i saw that his enthusiasm was producing a marked effect upon the minds of the five wakwafi who appeared to understand something of his talk but now i thought it time to put a stop to it for there is nothing that i hate so much as this zulu system of extravagant praising bongering as they call it silence i said has all thy noisy talk been stopped up since last i saw thee that it breaks out thus and sweeps us away what doest thou here with these men thou whom i left a chief in zululand how is it that thou art far from thine own place and gathered together with strangers umslopogaas leant himself upon the head of his long battleaxe which was nothing else but a pole axe with a beautiful handle of rhinoceros horn and his grim face grew sad my father he answered i have a word to tell thee but i cannot speak it before these low people umfagozana and he glanced at the wakwafi askari it is for thine own ear my father this will i say and here his face grew stern again a woman betrayed me to the death and covered my name with shame ay my own wife a round faced girl betrayed me but i escaped from death ay i broke from the very hands of those who came to slay me i struck but three blows with this mine axe inkosikaas surely my father will remember it one to the right one to the left and one in front and yet i left three men dead and then i fled and as my father knows even now that i am old my feet are as the feet of the sassaby endnote 2 and there breathes not the man who by running can touch me again when once i have bounded from his side on i sped and after me came the messengers of death and their voice was as the voice of dogs that hunt from my own kraal i flew and as i passed she who had betrayed me was drawing water from the spring i fleeted by her like the shadow of death and as i went i smote with mine axe and lo her head fell it fell into the water pan then i fled north day after day i journeyed on for three moons i journeyed resting not stopping not but running on towards forgetfulness till i met the party of the white hunter who is now dead and am come hither with his servants and nought have i brought with me i who was high born ay of the blood of chaka the great king a chief and a captain of the regiment of the nkomabakosi am a wanderer in strange places a man without a kraal nought have i brought save this mine axe of all my belongings this remains alone they have divided my cattle they have taken my wives and my children know my face no more yet with this axe and he swung the formidable weapon round his head making the air hiss as he clove it will i cut another path to fortune i have spoken i shook my head at him umslopogaas i said i know thee from of old ever ambitious ever plotting to be great i fear me that thou hast overreached thyself at last years ago when thou wouldst have plotted against cetywayo son of panda i warned thee and thou didst listen but now when i was not by thee to stay thy hand thou hast dug a pit for thine own feet to fall in is it not so but what is done is done who can make the dead tree green or gaze again upon last year's light who can recall the spoken word or bring back the spirit of the fallen that which time swallows comes not up again let it be forgotten and now behold umslopogaas i know thee for a great warrior and a brave man faithful to the death even in zululand where all the men are brave they called thee the slaughterer and at night told stories round the fire of thy strength and deeds hear me now thou seest this great man my friend and i pointed to sir henry he also is a warrior as great as thou and strong as thou art he could throw thee over his shoulder incubu is his name and thou seest this one also him with the round stomach the shining eye and the pleasant face bougwan glass eye is his name and a good man is he and a true being of a curious tribe who pass their life upon the water and live in floating kraals now we three whom thou seest would travel inland past dongo egere the great white mountain mt kenia and far into the unknown beyond we know not what we shall find there we go to hunt and seek adventures and new places being tired of sitting still with the same old things around us wilt thou come with us to thee shall be given command of all our servants but what shall befall thee that i know not once before we three journeyed thus in search of adventure and we took with us a man such as thou one umbopa and behold we left him the king of a great country with twenty impis regiments each of 3,000 plumed warriors waiting on his word how it shall go with thee i know not mayhap death awaits thee and us wilt thou throw thyself to fortune and come or fearest thou umslopogaas the great man smiled thou art not altogether right macumazahn he said i have plotted in my time but it was not ambition that led me to my fall but shame on me that i should have to say it a fair woman's face let it pass so we are going to see something like the old times again macumazahn when we fought and hunted in zululand ay i will come come life come death what care i so that the blows fall fast and the blood runs red i grow old i grow old and i have not fought enough and yet am i a warrior among warriors see my scars and he pointed to countless cicatrices stabs and cuts that marked the skin of his chest and legs and arms see the hole in my head the brains gushed out therefrom yet did i slay him who smote and live knowest thou how many men i have slain in fair hand to hand combat macumazahn see here is the tale of them and he pointed to long rows of notches cut in the rhinoceros horn handle of his axe number them macumazahn one hundred and three and i have never counted but those whom i have ripped open endnote 3 nor have i reckoned those whom another man had struck be silent i said for i saw that he was getting the blood fever on him be silent well art thou called the slaughterer we would not hear of thy deeds of blood remember if thou comest with us we fight not save in self defence listen we need servants these men and i pointed to the wakwafi who had retired a little way during our indaba talk say they will not come will not come shouted umslopogaas where is the dog who says he will not come when my father orders here thou and with a single bound he sprang upon the wakwafi with whom i had first spoken and seizing him by the arm dragged him towards us thou dog he said giving the terrified man a shake didst thou say that thou wouldst not go with my father say it once more and i will choke thee and his long fingers closed round his throat as he said it thee and those with thee hast thou forgotten how i served thy brother nay we will come with the white man gasped the man white man went on umslopogaas in simulated fury which a very little provocation would have made real enough of whom speakest thou insolent dog nay we will go with the great chief so said umslopogaas in a quiet voice as he suddenly released his hold so that the man fell backward i thought you would that man umslopogaas seems to have a curious moral ascendency over his companions good afterwards remarked thoughtfully chapter ii the black hand in due course we left lamu and ten days afterwards we found ourselves at a spot called charra on the tana river having gone through many adventures which need not be recorded here amongst other things we visited a ruined city of which there are many on this coast and which must once to judge from their extent and the numerous remains of mosques and stone houses have been very populous places these ruined cities are immeasurably ancient having i believe been places of wealth and importance as far back as the old testament times when they were centres of trade with india and elsewhere but their glory has departed now the slave trade has finished them and where wealthy merchants from all parts of the then civilized world stood and bargained in the crowded market places the lion holds his court at night and instead of the chattering of slaves and the eager voices of the bidders his awful note goes echoing down the ruined corridors at this particular place we discovered on a mound covered up with rank growth and rubbish two of the most beautiful stone doorways that it is possible to conceive the carving on them was simply exquisite and i only regret that we had no means of getting them away no doubt they had once been the entrances to a palace of which however no traces were now to be seen though probably its ruins lay under the rising mound gone quite gone the way that everything must go like the nobles and the ladies who lived within their gates these cities have had their day and now they are as babylon and nineveh and as london and paris will one day be nothing may endure that is the inexorable law men and women empires and cities thrones principalities and powers mountains rivers and unfathomed seas worlds spaces and universes all have their day and all must go in this ruined and forgotten place the moralist may behold a symbol of the universal destiny for this system of ours allows no room for standing still nothing can loiter on the road and check the progress of things upwards towards life or the rush of things downwards towards death the stern policeman fate moves us and them on on uphill and downhill and across the level there is no resting place for the weary feet till at last the abyss swallows us and from the shores of the transitory we are hurled into the sea of the eternal at charra we had a violent quarrel with the headman of the bearers we had hired to go as far as this and who now wished to extort large extra payment from us in the result he threatened to set the masai about whom more anon on to us that night he with all our hired bearers ran away stealing most of the goods which had been entrusted to them to carry luckily however they had not happened to steal our rifles ammunition and personal effects not because of any delicacy of feeling on their part but owing to the fact that they chanced to be in the charge of the five wakwafis after that it was clear to us that we had had enough of caravans and of bearers indeed we had not much left for a caravan to carry and yet how were we to get on it was good who solved the question here is water he said pointing to the tana river and yesterday i saw a party of natives hunting hippopotami in canoes i understand that mr mackenzie's mission station is on the tana river why not get into canoes and paddle up to it this brilliant suggestion was needless to say received with acclamation and i instantly set to work to buy suitable canoes from the surrounding natives i succeeded after a delay of three days in obtaining two large ones each hollowed out of a single log of some light wood and capable of holding six people and baggage for these two canoes we had to pay nearly all our remaining cloth and also many other articles on the day following our purchase of the two canoes we effected a start in the first canoe were good sir henry and three of our wakwafi followers in the second myself umslopogaas and the other two wakwafis as our course lay upstream we had to keep four paddles at work in each canoe which meant that the whole lot of us except good had to row away like galley slaves and very exhausting work it was i say except good for of course the moment that good got into a boat his foot was on his native heath and he took command of the party and certainly he worked us on shore good is a gentle mild mannered man and given to jocosity but as we found to our cost good in a boat was a perfect demon to begin with he knew all about it and we didn't on all nautical subjects from the torpedo fittings of a man of war down to the best way of handling the paddle of an african canoe he was a perfect mine of information which to say the least of it we were not also his ideas of discipline were of the sternest and in short he came the royal naval officer over us pretty considerably and paid us out amply for all the chaff we were wont to treat him to on land but on the other hand i am bound to say that he managed the boats admirably after the first day good succeeded with the help of some cloth and a couple of poles in rigging up a sail in each canoe which lightened our labours not a little but the current ran very strong against us and at the best we were not able to make more than twenty miles a day our plan was to start at dawn and paddle along till about half past ten by which time the sun got too hot to allow of further exertion then we moored our canoes to the bank and ate our frugal meal after which we ate or otherwise amused ourselves till about three o'clock when we again started and rowed till within an hour of sundown when we called a halt for the night on landing in the evening good would at once set to work with the help of the askari to build a little scherm or small enclosure fenced with thorn bushes and to light a fire i with sir henry and umslopogaas would go out to shoot something for the pot generally this was an easy task for all sorts of game abounded on the banks of the tana one night sir henry shot a young cow giraffe of which the marrow bones were excellent on another i got a couple of waterbuck right and left and once to his own intense satisfaction umslopogaas who like most zulus was a vile shot with a rifle managed to kill a fine fat eland with a martini i had lent him sometimes we varied our food by shooting some guinea fowl or bush bustard paau both of which were numerous with a shot gun or by catching a supply of beautiful yellow fish with which the waters of the tana swarmed and which form i believe one of the chief food supplies of the crocodiles three days after our start an ominous incident occurred we were just drawing in to the bank to make our camp as usual for the night when we caught sight of a figure standing on a little knoll not forty yards away and intensely watching our approach one glance was sufficient although i was personally unacquainted with the tribe to tell me that he was a masai elmoran or young warrior indeed had i had any doubts they would have quickly been dispelled by the terrified ejaculation of _masai_ that burst simultaneously from the lips of our wakwafi followers who are as i think i have said themselves bastard masai and what a figure he presented as he stood there in his savage war gear accustomed as i have been to savages all my life i do not think that i have ever before seen anything quite so ferocious or awe inspiring to begin with the man was enormously tall quite as tall as umslopogaas i should say and beautifully though somewhat slightly shaped but with the face of a devil in his right hand he held a spear about five and a half feet long the blade being two and a half feet in length by nearly three inches in width and having an iron spike at the end of the handle that measured more than a foot on his left arm was a large and well made elliptical shield of buffalo hide on which were painted strange heraldic looking devices on his shoulders was a huge cape of hawk's feathers and round his neck was a naibere or strip of cotton about seventeen feet long by one and a half broad with a stripe of colour running down the middle of it the tanned goatskin robe which formed his ordinary attire in times of peace was tied lightly round his waist so as to serve the purposes of a belt and through it were stuck on the right and left sides respectively his short pear shaped sime or sword which is made of a single piece of steel and carried in a wooden sheath and an enormous knobkerrie but perhaps the most remarkable feature of his attire consisted of a headdress of ostrich feathers which was fixed on the chin and passed in front of the ears to the forehead and being shaped like an ellipse completely framed the face so that the diabolical countenance appeared to project from a sort of feather fire screen round the ankles he wore black fringes of hair and projecting from the upper portion of the calves to which they were attached were long spurs like spikes from which flowed down tufts of the beautiful black and waving hair of the colobus monkey such was the elaborate array of the masai elmoran who stood watching the approach of our two canoes but it is one which to be appreciated must be seen only those who see it do not often live to describe it of course i could not make out all these details of his full dress on the occasion of this my first introduction being indeed amply taken up with the consideration of the general effect but i had plenty of subsequent opportunities of becoming acquainted with the items that went to make it up whilst we were hesitating what to do the masai warrior drew himself up in a dignified fashion shook his huge spear at us and turning vanished on the further side of the slope hulloa holloaed sir henry from the other boat our friend the caravan leader has been as good as his word and set the masai after us do you think it will be safe to go ashore i did not think it would be at all safe but on the other hand we had no means of cooking in the canoes and nothing that we could eat raw so it was difficult to know what to do at last umslopogaas simplified matters by volunteering to go and reconnoitre which he did creeping off into the bush like a snake while we hung off in the stream waiting for him in half an hour he returned and told us that there was not a masai to be seen anywhere about but that he had discovered a spot where they had recently been encamped and that from various indications he judged that they must have moved on an hour or so before the man we saw having no doubt been left to report upon our movements thereupon we landed and having posted a sentry proceeded to cook and eat our evening meal this done we took the situation into our serious consideration of course it was possible that the apparition of the masai warrior had nothing to do with us that he was merely one of a band bent upon some marauding and murdering expedition against another tribe but when we recalled the threat of the caravan leader and reflected on the ominous way in which the warrior had shaken his spear at us this did not appear very probable on the contrary what did seem probable was that the party was after us and awaiting a favourable opportunity to attack us this being so there were two things that we could do one of which was to go on and the other to go back the latter idea was however rejected at once it being obvious that we should encounter as many dangers in retreat as in advance and besides we had made up our minds to journey onwards at any price under these circumstances however we did not consider it safe to sleep ashore so we got into our canoes and paddling out into the middle of the stream which was not very wide here managed to anchor them by means of big stones fastened to ropes made of coconut fibre of which there were several fathoms in each canoe here the mosquitoes nearly ate us up alive and this combined with anxiety as to our position effectually prevented me from sleeping as the others were doing notwithstanding the attacks of the aforesaid tana mosquitoes and so i lay awake smoking and reflecting on many things but being of a practical turn of mind chiefly on how we were to give those masai villains the slip it was a beautiful moonlight night and notwithstanding the mosquitoes and the great risk we were running from fever from sleeping in such a spot and forgetting that i had the cramp very badly in my right leg from squatting in a constrained position in the canoe and that the wakwafi who was sleeping beside me smelt horribly i really began to enjoy myself the moonbeams played upon the surface of the running water that speeded unceasingly past us towards the sea like men's lives towards the grave till it glittered like a wide sheet of silver that is in the open where the trees threw no shadows near the banks however it was very dark and the night wind sighed sadly in the reeds to our left on the further side of the river was a little sandy bay which was clear of trees and here i could make out the forms of numerous antelopes advancing to the water till suddenly there came an ominous roar whereupon they all made off hurriedly then after a pause i caught sight of the massive form of his majesty the lion coming down to drink his fill after meat presently he moved on then came a crashing of the reeds about fifty yards above us and a few minutes later a huge black mass rose out of the water about twenty yards from me and snorted it was the head of a hippopotamus down it went without a sound only to rise again within five yards of where i sat this was decidedly too near to be comfortable more especially as the hippopotamus was evidently animated by intense curiosity to know what on earth our canoes were"
