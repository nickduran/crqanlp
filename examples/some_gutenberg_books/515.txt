"1" "thought knowles evaded the question wished to leave the subject perhaps he did not regard the poor old school master as a practical judge of practical matters all his life he had called him thriftless and unready it never will do knowles he went on in his slow way any plan phalanstery or community call it what you please founded on self government is based on a sham the tawdriest of shams the old school master shook his head as one who knows and tried to push the thin gray hairs out of his eyes in a groping way margret lifted them back so quietly that he did not feel her you'll call the republic a sham next said the doctor coolly aggravating the republic the old man quickened his tone like a war horse scenting the battle near at hand there never was a thinner crusted devil's egg in the world than democracy i think i've told you that before i think you have said the other dryly you always were a tory mr howth said his wife in her placid creamy way it is in the blood i think doctor the howths fought under cornwallis you know the school master waited until his wife had ended very true mrs howth he said with a grave smile then his thin face grew hot again no dr knowles your scheme is but a sign of the mad age we live in since the thirteenth century when the anarchic element sprang full grown into the history of humanity that history has been chaos and this republic is the culmination of chaos out of chaos came the new born earth suggested the doctor but its foundations were granite rejoined the old man with nervous eagerness granite not the slime of yesterday when you found empires go to work as god worked the doctor did not answer sat looking instead out into the dark indifferently as if the heresies which the old man hurled at him were some old worn out song seeing however that the school master's flush of enthusiasm seemed on the point of dying out he roused himself to gibe it into life well mr howth what will you have if the trodden rights of the human soul are the slime of yesterday how shall we found our empire to last on despotism civil or theocratic any despotism is better than that of newly enfranchised serfs replied the school master the doctor laughed what a successful politician you would have made you would have had such a winning way to the hearts of the great unwashed mrs howth laid down her knitting my dear she said timidly i think that is treason the angry heat died out of his face instantly as he turned to her without the glimmer of a covert smile at her simplicity she was a woman and when he spoke to the doctor it was in a tone less sharp what is it the boys used to declaim their yankee hearts throbbing under their round aborts happy proud america somehow in that way cursed abased america better if they had said look at her in the warm vigour of her youth most vigorous in decay look at the germs and dregs of nations creeds religions fermenting together as for the theory of self government it will muddle down here as in the three great archetypes of the experiment into a paling miserable failure the doctor did not hear some sharper shadow seemed to haunt him than the downfall of the republic what help did he seek in this girl his keen deep eyes never left her unconscious face no mr howth went on having the field to himself we left order back there in the ages you call dark and progress will trumpet the world into the ditch comte growled the doctor the school master's cane beat an angry tattoo on the hearth you sneer at comte because having the clearest eye the widest sweeping eye ever given to man he had no more it was to show how far flesh can go alone could he help it if god refused the prophet's vision i'm sure samuel interrupted his wife with a sorrowful earnestness your own eyes were as strong as a man's could be it was ten years after i wore spectacles that you began only for that miserable fever you could read shorthand now her own blue eyes filled with tears there was a sudden silence margret shivered as if some pain stung her holding her father's bony hand in hers she patted it on her knee the hand trembled a little knowles's sharp eyes darted from one to the other then with a smothered growl he shook himself and rushed headlong into the old battle which he and the school master had been waging now off and on some six years that was a fight i can tell you none of your shallow polite clashing of modern theories no talk of your jeffersonian democracy your high bred federalism they took hold of the matter by the roots clear at the beginning mrs howth's breath fairly left her they went into the soul of the matter in such a dangerous way what if joel should hear no doubt he would report that his master was an infidel that would be the next thing they would hear he was in the kitchen now he finished his wood chopping an hour ago asleep doubtless that was one comfort well if he were awake he could not understand that class of people and mrs howth into whose kindly brain just enough of her husband's creed had glimmered to make her say that class of people in the tone with which abraham would not have spoken of dives over the gulf went tranquilly back to her knitting wondering why dr knowles should come ten times now where he used to come once to provoke samuel into these wearisome arguments ever since their misfortune came on them he had been there every night always at it she should think he might be a little more considerate mr howth surely had enough to think of what with his his misfortune and the starvation waiting for them and poor margret's degradation she sighed here without bothering his head about the theocratic principle or the battle of armageddon she had hinted as much to dr knowles one day and he had muttered out something about its being the life of the dog ma'am she wondered what he meant by that she looked over at his bearish figure snuff drabbled waistcoat and shock of black hair well poor man he could not help it if he were coarse and an abolitionist and a fourierite and she was getting a little muddy now she was conscious so turned her mind back to the repose of her stocking margret took it very quietly seeing her father flaming so but margret never had any opinions to express she was not like the parnells they were noted for their clear judgment mrs howth was a parnell the combat deepens on ye brave the doctor's fat leathery face was quite red now and his sentences were hurled out in a sarcastic bass enough to wither the marrow of a weak man but the school master was no weak man his foot was entirely on his native heath i assure you he knew every inch of the ground from the domination of the absolute faith in the ages of fetichism to its pseudo presentment in the tenth century and its actual subversion in the nineteenth every step our politicians might have picked up an idea or two there i should think then he was so cool about it so skilful he fairly rubbed his hands with glee enjoying the combat and he was so sure that the doctor was savagely in earnest why any one with half an ear could hear that he did not see how in the very heat of the fray his eyes would wander off listlessly but mr howth did not wander there was nothing careless or two sided in the making of this man no sham about him or borrowing they came down gradually or out for as i told you they dug into the very heart of the matter at first they came out gradually to modern times things began to assume a more familiar aspect spinoza fichte saint simon one heard about them now if you could but have heard the school master deal with these his enemies with what tender charity for the man what relentless vengeance for the belief he pounced on them dragging the soul out of their systems holding it up for slow slaughter as for humanity how knowles lingered on that word with a tenderness curious in so uncouth a mass of flesh as for humanity it was a study to see it stripped and flouted and thrown out of doors like a filthy rag by this poor old howth a man too child hearted to kill a spider it was pleasanter to hear him when he defended the great past in which his ideal truth had been faintly shadowed how he caught the salient tints of the feudal life how the fine womanly nature of the man rose exulting in the free picturesque glow of the day of crusader and heroic deed how he crowded in traits of perfected manhood in the conqueror simple trust in the serf to colour and weaken his argument not seeing that he weakened it how when he thought he had cornered the doctor he would colour and laugh like a boy then suddenly check himself lest he might wound him a curious laugh genial cheery bubbling out of his weak voice in a way that put you in mind of some old and rare wine when he would check himself in one of these triumphant glows he would turn to the doctor with a deprecatory gravity and for a few moments be almost submissive in his reply so earnest and worn it looked then the poor old face in the dim light the black clothes he wore were so threadbare and shining at the knees and elbows the coarse leather shoes brought to so fine a polish the doctor idly wondered who had blacked them glancing at margret's fingers there was a flower stuck in the button hole of the school master's coat a pale tea rose if dr knowles had been a man of fine instincts which his opaque shining eyes would seem to deny he might have thought it was not unapt or ill placed even in the shabby scuffed coat a scholar a gentleman though in patched shoes and trousers a world too short old and gaunt hunger bitten even it may be with loose jointed bony limbs and yellow face clinging loyal and brave to the quaint delicate fancies of his youth that were dust and ashes to other men in the very haggard face you could find the quiet purity of the child he had been and the old child's smile fresh and credulous on the mouth the doctor had not spoken for a moment it might be that he was careless of the poetic lights with which mr howth tenderly decorated his old faith or it might be that even he with the terrible intentness of a real life purpose in his brain was touched by the picture of the far old chivalry dead long ago the master's voice grew low and lingering now it was a labour of love this oh it is so easy to go back out of the broil of dust and meanness and barter into the clear shadow of that old life where love and bravery stand eternal verities never to be bought and sold in that dusty town yonder to go back to dream back rather to drag out of our own hearts as the hungry old master did whatever is truest and highest there and clothe it with name and deed in the dim days of chivalry make a poem of it so much easier than to make a life knowles shuffled uneasily watching the girl keenly to know how the picture touched her was then she thought this grand dead past so shallow to him these knights pure unstained searching until death for the holy grail could he understand the life long agony the triumph of their conflict over self these women content to live in solitude forever because they once had loved could any man understand that or the dead queen dead that the man she loved might be free and happy why this was life this death but did pain and martyrdom and victory lie back in the days of galahad and arthur alone the homely face grew stiller than before looking out into the dun sweep of moorland cold unrevealing it baffled the man that looked at it he shuffled chewed tobacco vehemently tilted his chair on two legs broke out in a thunder gust at last dead days for dead men the world hears a bugle call to day more noble than any of your piping troubadours we have something better to fight for than a vacant tomb the old man drew himself up haughtily i know what you would say liberty for the low and vile it is a good word that was a better which they hid in their hearts in the old time honour honour i think calvinist though he was that word was his religion men have had worse perhaps the doctor thought this for he rose abruptly and leaning on the old man's chair said gently it is better even here yet you poison this child's mind you make her despise to day make honour live for her now it does not the school master said bitterly the world's a failure all the great old dreams are dead your own phantom your republic your experiment to prove that all men are born free and equal what is it to day knowles lifted his head looking out into the brown twilight some word of pregnant meaning flashed in his eye and trembled on his lip but he kept it back his face glowed though and the glow and strength gave to the huge misshapen features a grand repose you talk of to day the old man continued querulously i am tired of it here is its type and history touching a county newspaper a fair type with its cant and bigotry and weight of uncomprehended fact bargain and sale it taints our religion our brains our flags yours and mine knowles with the rest did you never hear of those abject spirits who entered neither heaven nor hell who were neither faithful to god nor rebellious caring only for themselves he paused fairly out of breath margret looked up knowles was silent there was a smothered look of pain on the coarse face the school master's words were sinking deeper than he knew no father said margret hastily ending his quotation io non averei creduto che vita tanta n avesse disfatta skilful margret the broil must have been turbid in the old man's brain which the grand slow stepping music of the florentine could not calm she had learned that long ago and used it as a nurse does some old song to quiet her pettish infant his face brightened instantly do not believe then child he said after a pause it is a noble doubt in dante or in you the doctor had turned away she could not see his face the angry scorn was gone from the old master's countenance it was bent with its usual wistful eagerness on the floor a moment after he looked up with a flickering smile onorate l altissmo poeta he said gently lifting his finger to his forehead in a military fashion where is my cane margret the doctor and i will go and walk on the porch before it grows dark the sun had gone down long before and the stars were out but no one spoke of this knowles lighted the school master's pipe and his own cigar and then moved the chairs out of their way stepping softly that the old man might not hear him margret in the room watched them as they went seeing how gentle the rough burly man was with her father and how every time they passed the sweet brier he bent the branches aside that they might not touch his face slow childish tears came into her eyes as she saw it for the school master was blind this had been their regular walk every evening since it grew too cold for them to go down under the lindens the doctor had not missed a night since her father gave up the school a month ago at first under pretence of attending to his eyes but since the day he had told them there was no hope of cure he had never spoken of it again only since then he had grown doubly quarrelsome standing ready armed to dispute with the old man every inch of every subject in earth or air keeping the old man in a state of boyish excitement during the long idle days looking forward to this nightly battle it was very still for the house with its half dozen acres lay in an angle of the hills looking out on the river which shut out all distant noises only the men's footsteps broke the silence passing and repassing the window without the october starlight lay white and frosty on the moors the old barn the sharp dark hills and the river which was half hidden by the orchard one could hear it like some huge giant moaning in his sleep at times and see broad patches of steel blue glittering through the thick apple trees and the bushes her mother had fallen into a doze margret looked at her thinking how sallow the plump fair face had grown and how faded the kindly blue eyes were now dim with crying she knew that though she never saw her shed a tear always cheery going placidly about the house in her gray dress and quaker cap as if there were no such things in the world as debt or blindness but margret knew though she said nothing when her mother came in from those wonderful foraging expeditions in search of late pease or corn she could see the swollen circle round the eyes and hear her breath like that of a child which has sobbed itself tired then one night when she had gone into her mother's room after she was in bed the blue eyes were set in a wild hopeless way as if staring down into years of starvation and misery the fire on the hearth burned low and clear the old worn furniture stood out cheerfully in the red glow and threw a maze of twisted shadow on the floor but the glow was all that was cheerful to morrow when the hard daylight should jeer away the screening shadows it would unbare a desolate shabby home she knew struck with the white leprosy of poverty the blank walls the faded hangings the old stone house itself looking vacantly out on the fields with a pitiful significance of loss upon the mantel shelf there was a small marble figure one of the dancing graces the other two were gone gone in pledge this one was left twirling her foot and stretching out her hands in a dreary sort of ecstasy with no one to respond for a moment so empty and bitter seemed her home and her life that she thought the lonely dancer with her flaunting joy mocked her taunted them with the slow gray desolation that had been creeping on them for years only for a moment the morbid fancy hurt her the red glow was healthier suited her temperament better she chose to fancy the house as it had been once should be again please god she chose to see the old comfort and the old beauty which the poor school master had gathered about their home gone now but it should return it was well perhaps that he was blind he knew so little of what had come on them there where the black marks were on the wall there had hung two pictures margret and her father religiously believed them to be a tintoret and copley well they were gone now he had been used to dust them with a light brush every morning himself but now he said always you can clean the pictures to day margret be careful my child and margret would remember the greasy irishman who had tucked them under his arm and flung them into a cart her blood growing hotter in her veins it was the same through all the house there was not a niche in the bare rooms that did not recall a something gone something that should return she willed that that evening standing by the dim fire what women will whose eyes are slow attentive still as this margret's usually comes to pass the red fire glow suited her another glow warming her floating fancy mingled with it giving her every day purpose the trait of heroism the old spirit of the dead chivalry of succour to the weak life long self denial did it need the sand waste of palestine or a tournament to call it into life down in that trading town in the thick of its mills and drays it could live she thought that very night perhaps in some of those fetid cellars or sunken shanties there were vigils kept of purpose as unselfish prayer as heaven commanding as that of the old aspirants for knighthood she too her quiet face stirred with a simple childish smile like her father's why mother she said stroking down the gray hair under the cap shall you sleep here all night laughing a cheery tender laugh this woman's was seldom heard not far from tears mrs howth roused herself just then a broad high shouldered man in a gray flannel shirt and shoes redolent of the stable appeared at the door margret looked at him as if he were an accusing spirit coming down as woman must from heights of self renunciation or bold resolve to an undarned stocking or an uncooked meal kittle's b'ilin he announced flinging in the information as a general gratuity that will do joel said mrs howth the tone of stately blandness which mrs howth erected as a shield between herself and that class of people was a study a success the resume of her experience in the combat that had devoured half her life like that of other american house keepers be gentle but let them know their place my dear the class having its type and exponent in joel stopped at the door and hitched up its suspenders that will do joel with a stern suavity some idea was in joel's head under the brush of red hair probably the anarchic element uh was wishin toh read the g'zette whereupon he advanced into the teeth of the enemy and bore off the newspaper going before margret as she went to the kitchen and seating himself beside a flaring tallow candle on the table reading with joel was not the idle pastime that more trivial minds find it a thing on the contrary to be gone into with slow spelling and face knitted up into savage sternness especially now when as he gravely explained to margret in his opinion the crissis was jest at hand and ev'ry man must be seein ef the gover'ment was carryin out the views of the people with which intent joel in company with five thousand other sovereigns consulted as definitive oracle the daily gazette of towbridge the school master need not have grumbled for the old time feodality in the days of warwick and of the daily gazette was not so widely different as he and joel thought now and then partly as an escape valve for his overcharged conviction partly in compassion to the ignorance of women in political economics he threw off to margret divers commentaries on the text as she passed in and out if she had risen to the full level of joel's views she might have considered these views tinctured with radicalism as they consisted in the propriety of the immediate impinging of the president besides joel was a good natured man too merciful to his beast nero like he wished with the tiger drop of blood that lies hid in everybody's heart that the few millions who differed with himself and the gazette had but one neck for their more convenient hanging it's all that'll save the kentry he said and believed it too if margret fell suddenly from the peak of outlook on life to the homely labor of cooking supper some of the healthy heroic flush of the knightly days and the hearth fire went down with her i think it brightened and reddened the square kitchen with its cracked stove and meagre array of tins she bustled about in her quaint way as if it had been filled up and running over with comforts it brightened and reddened her face when she came in to put the last dish on the table a cosy snug table set for four heroic dreams with poets i suppose make them unfit for food other than some feast such as eve set for the angel but then margret was no poet so with the kindling of her hope its healthful light struck out and warmed and glorified these common things such common things only a coarse white cloth redeemed by neither silver nor china the amber coffee some that knowles had brought out to her father thrown on his hands he couldn't use it product of slave labour never sir the delicate brown fish that joel had caught the bread her mother had made the golden butter all of them touched her nerves with a quick sense of beauty and pleasure and more the gaunt face of the blind old man his bony hand trembling as he raised the cup to his lips her mother and the doctor managing silently to place everything he liked best near his plate wasn't it all part of the fresh hopeful glow burning in her consciousness it brightened and deepened it blotted out the hard dusty path of the future and showed warm and clear the success at the end not much to show you think only the old home as it once was full of quiet laughter and content only her mother's eyes clear shining again only that gaunt old head raised proudly owing no man anything but courtesy the glow deepened as she thought of it it was strange too that with the deep slow moving nature of this girl she should have striven so eagerly to throw this light over the future commoner natures have done more and hoped less it was a poor gift you think this of the labour of a life for so plain a duty hardly heroic she knew it yet if there lay in this coming labour any pain any wearing effort she clung to it desperately as if this should banish it might be worse loss she tried desperately i say to clutch the far uncertain hope at the end to make happiness out of it to give it to her silent gnawing heart to feed on she thrust out of sight all possible life that might have called her true self into being and clung to this present shallow duty and shallow reward pitiful and vain so to cling it is the way of women as if any human soul could bury that which might have been in that which is the doctor peering into her thought with sharp suspicious eyes heeded the transient flush of enthusiasm but little even the pleasant cheery talk that pleased her father so was but surface deep he knew the woman he must conquer for his great end lay beneath dark and cold it was only for that end he cared for her through what cold depths of solitude her soul breathed faintly mattered little yet an idle fancy touched him what a triumph the man had gained whoever he might be who had held the master key to a nature so rare as this who had the kingly power in his hand to break its silence into electric shivers of laughter and tears terrible subtile pain or joy as terrible did he hold the power still he wondered meanwhile she sat there unread chapter ii the evening came on slow and cold life itself the doctor thought impatiently was cool and tardy here among the hills even he fell into the tranquil tone and chafed under it nowhere else did the evening gray and sombre into the mysterious night impalpably as here the quiet wide and deep folded him in forced his trivial heat into silence and thought the world seemed to think there quiet in the dead seas of fog that filled the valleys like restless vapour curdled into silence quiet in the listening air stretching gray up to the stars in the solemn mountains that stood motionless like hoary headed prophets waiting with uplifted hands day and night to hear the voice silent now for centuries the very air heavy with the breath of the sleeping pine forests moved slowly and cold like some human voice weary with preaching to unbelieving hearts of a peace on earth this man's heart was unbelieving he chafed in the oppressive"
