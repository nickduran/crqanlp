"1" "livelihood from the world for her children and herself they had been in chicago a week and she was buying at bauder peck's now bauder peck importers are known the world over it is doubtful if there is one of you who has not been supplied indirectly with some imported bit of china or glassware with french opera glasses or cunning toys and dolls from the great new york and chicago showrooms of that company young bauder himself was waiting on mrs brandeis and he was frowning because he hated to sell women young bauder was being broken into the chicago end of the business and he was not taking gracefully to the process at the end of a long aisle on an obscure shelf in a dim corner molly brandeis sharp eyes espied a motley collection of dusty grimy china figures of the kind one sees on the mantel in the parlor of the small town catholic home winnebago's population was two thirds catholic german and irish and very devout mrs brandeis stopped short how much for that lot she pointed to the shelf young bauder's gaze followed hers puzzled the figures were from five inches to a foot high in crude effective blues and gold and crimson and white all the saints were there in assorted sizes the pieta the cradle in the manger there were probably two hundred or more of the little figures oh those said young bauder vaguely you don't want that stuff now about that limoges china as i said i can make you a special price on it if you carry it as an open stock pattern you'll find how much for that lot repeated mrs brandeis those are left over samples mrs brandeis last year's stuff they're all dirty i'd forgotten they were there how much for the lot said mrs brandeis pleasantly for the third time i really don't know three hundred i should say but i'll give you two hundred ventured mrs brandeis her heart in her mouth and her mouth very firm oh come now mrs brandeis bauder peck don't do business that way you know we'd really rather not sell them at all the things aren't worth much to us or to you for that matter but three hundred two hundred repeated mrs brandeis or i cancel my order including the limoges i want those figures and she got them which isn't the point of the story the holy figures were fine examples of foreign workmanship their colors beneath the coating of dust as brilliant and fadeless as those found in the churches of europe they reached winnebago duly packed in straw and paper still dusty and shelf worn mrs brandeis and sadie and pearl sat on up ended boxes at the rear of the store in the big barn like room in which newly arrived goods were unpacked as aloysius dived deep into the crate and brought up figure after figure the three women plunged them into warm and soapy water and proceeded to bathe and scour the entire school of saints angels and cherubim they came out brilliantly fresh and rosy all the irish ingenuity and artistry in aloysius came to the surface as he dived again and again into the great barrel and brought up the glittering pieces it'll make an elegant window he gasped from the depths of the hay his lean lengthy frame jack knifed over the edge and cheap his shrewd wit had long ago divined the store's price mark if father fitzpatrick steps by in the forenoon i'll bet they'll be gone before nighttime to morrow you'll be letting me do the trim mrs brandeis he came back that evening to do it and he threw his whole soul into it which considering his ancestry and temperament was very high voltage for one small town store window he covered the floor of the window with black crepe paper and hung it in long folds like a curtain against the rear wall the gilt of the scepters and halos and capes showed up dazzlingly against this background the scarlets and pinks and blues and whites of the robes appeared doubly bright the whole made a picture that struck and held you by its vividness and contrast father fitzpatrick very tall and straight and handsome with his iron gray hair and his cheeks pink as a girl's did step by next morning on his way to the post office it was whispered that in his youth father fitzpatrick had been an actor and that he had deserted the footlights for the altar lights because of a disappointment the drama's loss was the church's gain you should have heard him on sunday morning now flaying them now swaying them he still had the actor's flexible voice vibrant tremulous or strident at will and no amount of fasting or praying had ever dimmed that certain something in his eye the something which makes the matinee idol not only did he step by now he turned came back stopped before the window then he entered madam he said to mrs brandeis you'll probably save more souls with your window display than i could in a month of hell fire sermons he raised his hand you have the sanction of the church which was the beginning of a queer friendship between the roman catholic priest and the jewess shopkeeper that lasted as long as molly brandeis lived by noon it seemed that the entire population of winnebago had turned devout the figures a tremendous bargain though sold at a high profit seemed to melt away from the counter that held them by three o'clock only one to a customer announced mrs brandeis by the middle of the week the window itself was ravished of its show by the end of the week there remained only a handful of the duller and less desirable pieces the minor saints so to speak saturday night mrs brandeis did a little figuring on paper the lot had cost her two hundred dollars she had sold for six hundred two from six leaves four four hundred dollars she repeated it to herself quietly her mind leaped back to the plush photograph album then to young bauder and his cool contempt and there stole over her that warm comfortable glow born of reassurance and triumph four hundred dollars not much in these days of big business we said you will remember that it was a pitiful enough little trick she turned to make it though an honest one and in the face of disapproval a rather magnificent one too for it gave to molly brandeis that precious quality self confidence out of which is born success chapter three by spring mrs brandeis had the farmer women coming to her for their threshing dishes and kitchenware and the west end culture club for their whist prizes she seemed to realize that the days of the general store were numbered and she set about making hers a novelty store there was something terrible about the earnestness with which she stuck to business she was not more than thirty eight at this time intelligent healthy fun loving but she stayed at it all day she listened and chatted to every one and learned much there was about her that human quality that invites confidence she made friends by the hundreds and friends are a business asset those blithe dressy and smooth spoken gentlemen known as traveling men used to tell her their troubles perched on a stool near the stove and show her the picture of their girl in the back of their watch and asked her to dinner at the haley house she listened to their tale of woe and advised them she admired the picture of the girl and gave some wholesome counsel on the subject of traveling men's lonely wives but she never went to dinner at the haley house it had not taken these debonair young men long to learn that there was a woman buyer who bought quickly decisively and intelligently and that she always demanded a duplicate slip even the most unscrupulous could not stuff an order of hers and when it came to dating she gave no quarter though they wore clothes that were two leaps ahead of the styles worn by the winnebago young men their straw sailors were likely to be saw edged when the local edges were smooth and their coats were more flaring or their trousers wider than the coats and trousers of the winnebago boys they were not for the most part the gay dogs that winnebago's fancy painted them many of them were very lonely married men who missed their wives and babies and loathed the cuspidored discomfort of the small town hotel lobby they appreciated mrs brandeis good natured sympathy and gave her the long end of a deal when they could it was sam kiser who had begged her to listen to his advice to put in battenberg patterns and braid long before the battenberg epidemic had become widespread and virulent now listen to me mrs brandeis he begged almost tearfully you're a smart woman don't let this get by you you know that i know that a salesman would have as much chance to sell you a gold brick as to sell old john d rockefeller a gallon of oil mrs brandeis eyed his samples coldly but it looks so unattractive and the average person has no imagination a bolt of white braid and a handful of buttons they wouldn't get a mental picture of the completed piece now embroidery silk then give em a real picture interrupted sam work up one of these water lily pattern table covers use no 100 braid and the smallest buttons stick it in the window and they'll tear their hair to get patterns she did it taking turns with pearl and sadie at weaving the great lacy square during dull moments when it was finished they placed it in the window where it lay like frosted lace exquisitely graceful and delicate with its tracery of curling petals and feathery fern sprays winnebago gazed and was bitten by the battenberg bug it wound itself up in a network of battenberg braid in all the numbers it bought buttons of every size it stitched away at battenberg covers doilies bedspreads blouses curtains battenberg tumbled foamed cascaded over winnebago's front porches all that summer listening to sam kiser had done it she listened to the farmer women too and to the mill girls and to the scant and precious pearls that dropped from the lips of the east end society section there was something about her brown eyes and her straight sensible nose that reassured them so that few suspected the mischievous in her for she was mischievous if she had not been i think she could not have stood the drudgery and the heartbreaks and the struggle and the terrific manual labor she used to guy people gently and they never guessed it mrs g manville smith for example never dreamed of the joy that her patronage brought molly brandeis who waited on her so demurely mrs g manville smith nee finnegan scorned the winnebago shops and was said to send to chicago for her hairpins it was known that her household was run on the most niggardly basis however and she short rationed her two maids outrageously it was said that she could serve less real food on more real lace doilies than any other housekeeper in winnebago now mrs brandeis sold scourine two cents cheaper than the grocery stores using it as an advertisement to attract housewives and making no profit on the article itself mrs g manville smith always patronized brandeis bazaar for scourine alone and thus represented pure loss also she my good womaned mrs brandeis that lady seeing her enter one day with her comic undulating gait double actioned like a giraffe's and her plumes that would have shamed a knight of pythias decided to put a stop to these unprofitable visits she waited on mrs g manville smith a dangerous gleam in her eye scourine spake mrs g manville smith how many a dozen anything else no send them mrs brandeis scribbling in her sales book stopped pencil poised we cannot send scourine unless with a purchase of other goods amounting to a dollar or more mrs g manville smith's plumes tossed and soared agitatedly but my good woman i don't want anything else then you'll have to carry the scourine certainly not i'll send for it the sale closes at five it was then 4 57 i never heard of such a thing you can't expect me to carry them now mrs g manville smith had been a dining room girl at the old haley house before she married george smith and long before he made his money in lumber you won't find them so heavy molly brandeis said smoothly i certainly would perhaps you would not you're used to that sort of thing rough work and all that aloysius doubled up behind the lamps knew what was coming from the gleam in his boss's eye there may be something in that molly brandeis returned sweetly that's why i thought you might not mind taking them they're really not much heavier than a laden tray oh exclaimed the outraged mrs g manville smith and took her plumes and her patronage out of brandeis bazaar forever that was as malicious as molly brandeis ever could be and it was forgivable malice most families must be described against the background of their homes but the brandeis family life was bounded and controlled by the store their meals and sleeping hours and amusements were regulated by it it taught them much and brought them much and lost them much fanny brandeis always said she hated it but it made her wise and tolerant and in the end famous i don't know what more one could ask of any institution it brought her in contact with men and women taught her how to deal with them after school she used often to run down to the store to see her mother while theodore went home to practice perched on a high stool in some corner she heard and saw and absorbed it was a great school for the sensitive highly organized dramatic little jewish girl for to paraphrase a well known stage line there are just as many kinds of people in winnebago as there are in washington it was about this time that fanny brandeis began to realize actively that she was different of course other little winnebago girls mothers did not work like a man in a store and she and bella weinberg were the only two in her room at school who stayed out on the day of atonement and on new year and the lesser jewish holidays also she went to temple on friday night and saturday morning when the other girls she knew went to church on sunday these things set her apart in the little middle western town but it was not these that constituted the real difference she played and slept and ate and studied like the other healthy little animals of her age the real difference was temperamental or emotional or dramatic or historic or all four they would be playing tag perhaps in one of the cool green ravines that were the beauty spots of the little wisconsin town they nestled like exquisite emeralds in the embrace of the hills those ravines and winnebago's civic surge had not yet swept them away in a deluge of old tin cans ashes dirt and refuse to be sold later for building lots the indians had camped and hunted in them the one under the court street bridge near the catholic church and monastery was the favorite for play it lay a lovely gracious thing below the hot little town all green and lush and cool a tiny stream dimpling through it the plump capuchin fathers in their coarse brown robes knotted about the waist with a cord their bare feet thrust into sandals would come out and sun themselves on the stone bench at the side of the monastery on the hill or would potter about the garden and suddenly fanny would stop quite still in the midst of her tag game struck with the beauty of the picture it called from the past little oriental that she was she was able to combine the dry text of her history book with the green of the trees the gray of the church and the brown of the monk's robes and evolve a thrilling mental picture therefrom the tag game and her noisy little companions vanished she was peopling the place with stealthy indians stealthy cunning yet savagely brave they bore no relation to the abject contemptible and rather smelly oneidas who came to the back door on summer mornings in calico and ragged overalls with baskets of huckleberries on their arm their pride gone a broken and conquered people she saw them wild free sovereign and there were no greasy berry peddling oneidas among them they were sioux and pottawatomies that last had the real indian sound and winnebagos and menomonees and outagamis she made them taciturn and beady eyed and lithe and fleet and every other adjectival thing her imagination and history book could supply the fat and placid capuchin fathers on the hill became jesuits sinister silent powerful with france and the church of rome behind them from the shelter of that big oak would step nicolet the brave first among wisconsin explorers and last to receive the credit for his hardihood jean nicolet she loved the sound of it and with him was la salle straight and slim and elegant and surely wearing ruffles and plumes and sword even in a canoe and tonty his italian friend and fellow adventurer tonty of the satins and velvets graceful tactful poised a shadowy figure his menacing iron hand so feared by the ignorant savages encased always in a glove surely a perfumed g slap a rude shove that jerked her head back sharply and sent her forward stumbling and jarred her like a fall ya a a tag you're it fanny's it indians priests cavaliers coureurs de bois all vanished fanny would stand a moment blinking stupidly the next moment she was running as fleetly as the best of the boys in savage pursuit of one of her companions in the tag game she was a strange mixture of tomboy and bookworm which was a mercifully kind arrangement for both body and mind the spiritual side of her was groping and staggering and feeling its way about as does that of any little girl whose mind is exceptionally active and whose mother is unusually busy it was on the day of atonement known in the hebrew as yom kippur in the year following her father's death that that side of her performed a rather interesting handspring fanny brandeis had never been allowed to fast on this the greatest and most solemn of jewish holy days molly brandeis modern side refused to countenance the practice of withholding food from any child for twenty four hours so it was in the face of disapproval that fanny making deep inroads into the steak and fried sweet potatoes at supper on the eve of the day of atonement announced her intention of fasting from that meal to supper on the following evening she had just passed her plate for a third helping of potatoes theodore one lap behind her in the race had entered his objection well for the land's sakes he protested i guess you're not the only one who likes sweet potatoes fanny applied a generous dab of butter to an already buttery morsel and chewed it with an air of conscious virtue i've got to eat a lot this is the last bite i'll have until to morrow night what's that exclaimed mrs brandeis sharply yes it is hooted theodore fanny went on conscientiously eating as she explained bella weinberg and i are going to fast all day we just want to see if we can betcha can't theodore said mrs brandeis regarded her small daughter with a thoughtful gaze but that isn't the object in fasting fanny just to see if you can if you're going to think of food all through the yom kippur services i sha'n't protested fanny passionately theodore would but i won't wouldn't any such thing denied theodore but if i'm going to play a violin solo during the memorial service i guess i've got to eat my regular meals theodore sometimes played at temple on special occasions the little congregation listening to the throbbing rise and fall of this fifteen year old boy's violin playing realized vaguely that here was something disturbingly harrowingly beautiful they did not know that they were listening to genius molly brandeis in her second best dress walked to temple yom kippur eve her son at her right side her daughter at her left she had made up her mind that she would not let this next day with its poignantly beautiful service move her too deeply it was the first since her husband's death and rabbi thalmann rather prided himself on his rendition of the memorial service that came at three in the afternoon a man of learning of sweetness and of gentle wit was rabbi thalmann and unappreciated by his congregation he stuck to the scriptures for his texts finding moses a greater leader than roosevelt and the miracle of the burning bush more wonderful than the marvels of twentieth century wizardy in electricity a little man rabbi thalmann with hands and feet as small and delicate as those of a woman fanny found him fascinating to look on in his rabbinical black broadcloth and his two pairs of glasses perched in reading upon his small hooked nose he stood very straight in the pulpit but on the street you saw that his back was bent just the least bit in the world or perhaps it was only his student stoop as he walked along with his eyes on the ground smoking those slender dapper pale brown cigars that looked as if they had been expressly cut and rolled to fit him the evening service was at seven the congregation rustling in silks was approaching the little temple from all directions inside there was a low toned buzz of conversation the brandeis seat was well toward the rear as befitted a less prosperous member of the rich little congregation this enabled them to get a complete picture of the room in its holiday splendor fanny drank it in eagerly her dark eyes soft and luminous the bare yellow varnished wooden pews glowed with the reflection from the chandeliers the seven branched candlesticks on either side of the pulpit were entwined with smilax the red plush curtain that hung in front of the ark on ordinary days and the red plush pulpit cover too were replaced by gleaming white satin edged with gold fringe and finished at the corners with heavy gold tassels how the rich white satin glistened in the light of the electric candles fanny brandeis loved the lights and the gleam and the music so majestic and solemn and the sight of the little rabbi sitting so straight and serious in his high backed chair or standing to read from the great bible there came to this emotional little jewess a thrill that was not born of religious fervor at all i am afraid the sheer drama of the thing got her in fact the thing she had set herself to do to day had in it very little of religion mrs brandeis had been right about that it was a test of endurance as planned fanny had never fasted in all her healthy life she would come home from school to eat formidable stacks of bread and butter enhanced by brown sugar or grape jelly and topped off with three or four apples from the barrel in the cellar two hours later she would attack a supper of fried potatoes and liver and tea and peach preserve and more stacks of bread and butter then there were the cherry trees in the back yard and the berry bushes not to speak of sundry bags of small hard candies of the jelly bean variety fitted for quick and secret munching during school she liked good things to eat this sturdy little girl as did her friend that blonde and creamy person bella weinberg the two girls exchanged meaningful glances during the evening service the weinbergs as befitted their station sat in the third row at the right and bella had to turn around to convey her silent messages to fanny the evening service was brief even to the sermon rabbi thalmann and his congregation would need their strength for to morrow's trial the brandeises walked home through the soft september night and the children had to use all their yom kippur dignity to keep from scuffling through the piled up drifts of crackling autumn leaves theodore went to the cellar and got an apple which he ate with what fanny considered an unnecessary amount of scrunching it was a firm juicy apple and it gave forth a cracking sound when his teeth met in its white meat fanny after regarding him with gloomy superiority went to bed she had willed to sleep late for gastronomic reasons but the mental command disobeyed itself and she woke early with a heavy feeling early as it was molly brandeis had tiptoed in still earlier to look at her strange little daughter she sometimes did that on saturday mornings when she left early for the store and fanny slept late this morning fanny's black hair was spread over the pillow as she lay on her back one arm outflung the other at her breast she made a rather startlingly black and white and scarlet picture as she lay there asleep fanny did things very much in that way too with broad vivid unmistakable splashes of color mrs brandeis looking at the black haired red lipped child sleeping there wondered just how much determination lay back of the broad white brow she had said little to fanny about this feat of fasting and she told herself that she disapproved of it but in her heart she wanted the girl to see it through once attempted fanny awoke at half past seven and her nostrils dilated to that most exquisite tantalizing and fragrant of smells the aroma of simmering coffee it permeated the house it tickled the senses it carried with it visions of hot brown breakfast rolls and eggs and butter fanny loved her breakfast she turned over now and decided to go to sleep again but she could not she got up and dressed slowly and carefully there was no one to hurry her this morning with the call from the foot of the stairs of fanny your egg'll get cold she put on clean crisp underwear and did her hair expertly she slipped an all enveloping pinafore over her head that the new silk dress might not be crushed before church time she thought that theodore would surely have finished his breakfast by this time but when she came down stairs he was at the table not only that he had just begun his breakfast an egg all golden and white and crisply brown at the frilly edges lay on his plate theodore always ate his egg in a mathematical sort of way he swallowed the white hastily first because he disliked it and mrs brandeis insisted that he eat it then he would brood a moment over the yolk that lay unmarred and complete like an amber jewel in the center of his plate then he would suddenly plunge his fork into the very heart of the jewel and it would flow over his plate mingling with the butter and he would catch it deftly with little mops of warm crisp buttery roll fanny passed the breakfast table just as theodore plunged his fork into the egg yolk she caught her breath sharply and closed her eyes then she turned and fled to the front porch and breathed deeply and windily of the heady september wisconsin morning air as she stood there with her stiff short black curls still damp and glistening in her best shoes and stockings with the all enveloping apron covering her sturdy little figure the light of struggle and renunciation in her face she typified something at once fine and earthy but the real struggle was to come later they went to temple at ten theodore with his beloved violin tucked carefully under his arm bella weinberg was waiting at the steps did you she asked eagerly of course not replied fanny disdainfully do you think i'd eat old breakfast when i said i was going to fast all day then with sudden suspicion did you no stoutly and they entered and took their seats it was fascinating to watch the other members of the congregation come in the women rustling the men subdued in the unaccustomed dignity of black on a week day one glance at the yellow pews was like reading a complete social and financial register the seating arrangement of the temple was the almanach de gotha of congregation emanu el old ben reitman patriarch
