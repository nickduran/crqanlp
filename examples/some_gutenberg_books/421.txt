inner end stood open on the upper floors and showed against the sky with steps and stairs of uncompleted masonry many of the windows were unglazed and bats flew in and out like doves out of a dove cote the night had begun to fall as i got close and in three of the lower windows which were very high up and narrow and well barred the changing light of a little fire began to glimmer was this the palace i had been coming to was it within these walls that i was to seek new friends and begin great fortunes why in my father's house on essen waterside the fire and the bright lights would show a mile away and the door open to a beggar's knock i came forward cautiously and giving ear as i came heard some one rattling with dishes and a little dry eager cough that came in fits but there was no sound of speech and not a dog barked the door as well as i could see it in the dim light was a great piece of wood all studded with nails and i lifted my hand with a faint heart under my jacket and knocked once then i stood and waited the house had fallen into a dead silence a whole minute passed away and nothing stirred but the bats overhead i knocked again and hearkened again by this time my ears had grown so accustomed to the quiet that i could hear the ticking of the clock inside as it slowly counted out the seconds but whoever was in that house kept deadly still and must have held his breath i was in two minds whether to run away but anger got the upper hand and i began instead to rain kicks and buffets on the door and to shout out aloud for mr balfour i was in full career when i heard the cough right overhead and jumping back and looking up beheld a man's head in a tall nightcap and the bell mouth of a blunderbuss at one of the first storey windows it's loaded said a voice i have come here with a letter i said to mr ebenezer balfour of shaws is he here from whom is it asked the man with the blunderbuss that is neither here nor there said i for i was growing very wroth well was the reply ye can put it down upon the doorstep and be off with ye i will do no such thing i cried i will deliver it into mr balfour's hands as it was meant i should it is a letter of introduction a what cried the voice sharply i repeated what i had said who are ye yourself was the next question after a considerable pause i am not ashamed of my name said i they call me david balfour at that i made sure the man started for i heard the blunderbuss rattle on the window sill and it was after quite a long pause and with a curious change of voice that the next question followed is your father dead i was so much surprised at this that i could find no voice to answer but stood staring ay the man resumed he'll be dead no doubt and that'll be what brings ye chapping to my door another pause and then defiantly well man he said i'll let ye in and he disappeared from the window chapter iii i make acquaintance of my uncle presently there came a great rattling of chains and bolts and the door was cautiously opened and shut to again behind me as soon as i had passed go into the kitchen and touch naething said the voice and while the person of the house set himself to replacing the defences of the door i groped my way forward and entered the kitchen the fire had burned up fairly bright and showed me the barest room i think i ever put my eyes on half a dozen dishes stood upon the shelves the table was laid for supper with a bowl of porridge a horn spoon and a cup of small beer besides what i have named there was not another thing in that great stone vaulted empty chamber but lockfast chests arranged along the wall and a corner cupboard with a padlock as soon as the last chain was up the man rejoined me he was a mean stooping narrow shouldered clay faced creature and his age might have been anything between fifty and seventy his nightcap was of flannel and so was the nightgown that he wore instead of coat and waistcoat over his ragged shirt he was long unshaved but what most distressed and even daunted me he would neither take his eyes away from me nor look me fairly in the face what he was whether by trade or birth was more than i could fathom but he seemed most like an old unprofitable serving man who should have been left in charge of that big house upon board wages are ye sharp set he asked glancing at about the level of my knee ye can eat that drop parritch i said i feared it was his own supper o said he i can do fine wanting it i'll take the ale though for it slockens moistens my cough he drank the cup about half out still keeping an eye upon me as he drank and then suddenly held out his hand let's see the letter said he i told him the letter was for mr balfour not for him and who do ye think i am says he give me alexander's letter you know my father's name it would be strange if i didnae he returned for he was my born brother and little as ye seem to like either me or my house or my good parritch i'm your born uncle davie my man and you my born nephew so give us the letter and sit down and fill your kyte if i had been some years younger what with shame weariness and disappointment i believe i had burst into tears as it was i could find no words neither black nor white but handed him the letter and sat down to the porridge with as little appetite for meat as ever a young man had meanwhile my uncle stooping over the fire turned the letter over and over in his hands do ye ken what's in it he asked suddenly you see for yourself sir said i that the seal has not been broken ay said he but what brought you here to give the letter said i no says he cunningly but ye'll have had some hopes nae doubt i confess sir said i when i was told that i had kinsfolk well to do i did indeed indulge the hope that they might help me in my life but i am no beggar i look for no favours at your hands and i want none that are not freely given for as poor as i appear i have friends of my own that will be blithe to help me hoot toot said uncle ebenezer dinnae fly up in the snuff at me we'll agree fine yet and davie my man if you're done with that bit parritch i could just take a sup of it myself ay he continued as soon as he had ousted me from the stool and spoon they're fine halesome food they're grand food parritch he murmured a little grace to himself and fell to your father was very fond of his meat i mind he was a hearty if not a great eater but as for me i could never do mair than pyke at food he took a pull at the small beer which probably reminded him of hospitable duties for his next speech ran thus if ye're dry ye'll find water behind the door to this i returned no answer standing stiffly on my two feet and looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart he on his part continued to eat like a man under some pressure of time and to throw out little darting glances now at my shoes and now at my home spun stockings once only when he had ventured to look a little higher our eyes met and no thief taken with a hand in a man's pocket could have shown more lively signals of distress this set me in a muse whether his timidity arose from too long a disuse of any human company and whether perhaps upon a little trial it might pass off and my uncle change into an altogether different man from this i was awakened by his sharp voice your father's been long dead he asked three weeks sir said i he was a secret man alexander a secret silent man he continued he never said muckle when he was young he'll never have spoken muckle of me i never knew sir till you told it me yourself that he had any brother dear me dear me said ebenezer nor yet of shaws i dare say not so much as the name sir said i to think o that said he a strange nature of a man for all that he seemed singularly satisfied but whether with himself or me or with this conduct of my father's was more than i could read certainly however he seemed to be outgrowing that distaste or ill will that he had conceived at first against my person for presently he jumped up came across the room behind me and hit me a smack upon the shoulder we'll agree fine yet he cried i'm just as glad i let you in and now come awa to your bed to my surprise he lit no lamp or candle but set forth into the dark passage groped his way breathing deeply up a flight of steps and paused before a door which he unlocked i was close upon his heels having stumbled after him as best i might and then he bade me go in for that was my chamber i did as he bid but paused after a few steps and begged a light to go to bed with hoot toot said uncle ebenezer there's a fine moon neither moon nor star sir and pit mirk said i i cannae see the bed dark as the pit hoot toot hoot toot said he lights in a house is a thing i dinnae agree with i'm unco feared of fires good night to ye davie my man and before i had time to add a further protest he pulled the door to and i heard him lock me in from the outside i did not know whether to laugh or cry the room was as cold as a well and the bed when i had found my way to it as damp as a peat hag but by good fortune i had caught up my bundle and my plaid and rolling myself in the latter i lay down upon the floor under lee of the big bedstead and fell speedily asleep with the first peep of day i opened my eyes to find myself in a great chamber hung with stamped leather furnished with fine embroidered furniture and lit by three fair windows ten years ago or perhaps twenty it must have been as pleasant a room to lie down or to awake in as a man could wish but damp dirt disuse and the mice and spiders had done their worst since then many of the window panes besides were broken and indeed this was so common a feature in that house that i believe my uncle must at some time have stood a siege from his indignant neighbours perhaps with jennet clouston at their head meanwhile the sun was shining outside and being very cold in that miserable room i knocked and shouted till my gaoler came and let me out he carried me to the back of the house where was a draw well and told me to wash my face there if i wanted and when that was done i made the best of my own way back to the kitchen where he had lit the fire and was making the porridge the table was laid with two bowls and two horn spoons but the same single measure of small beer perhaps my eye rested on this particular with some surprise and perhaps my uncle observed it for he spoke up as if in answer to my thought asking me if i would like to drink ale for so he called it i told him such was my habit but not to put himself about na na said he i'll deny you nothing in reason he fetched another cup from the shelf and then to my great surprise instead of drawing more beer he poured an accurate half from one cup to the other there was a kind of nobleness in this that took my breath away if my uncle was certainly a miser he was one of that thorough breed that goes near to make the vice respectable when we had made an end of our meal my uncle ebenezer unlocked a drawer and drew out of it a clay pipe and a lump of tobacco from which he cut one fill before he locked it up again then he sat down in the sun at one of the windows and silently smoked from time to time his eyes came coasting round to me and he shot out one of his questions once it was and your mother and when i had told him that she too was dead ay she was a bonnie lassie then after another long pause whae were these friends o yours i told him they were different gentlemen of the name of campbell though indeed there was only one and that the minister that had ever taken the least note of me but i began to think my uncle made too light of my position and finding myself all alone with him i did not wish him to suppose me helpless he seemed to turn this over in his mind and then davie my man said he ye've come to the right bit when ye came to your uncle ebenezer i've a great notion of the family and i mean to do the right by you but while i'm taking a bit think to mysel of what's the best thing to put you to whether the law or the meenistry or maybe the army whilk is what boys are fondest of i wouldnae like the balfours to be humbled before a wheen hieland campbells and i'll ask you to keep your tongue within your teeth nae letters nae messages no kind of word to onybody or else there's my door uncle ebenezer said i i've no manner of reason to suppose you mean anything but well by me for all that i would have you to know that i have a pride of my own it was by no will of mine that i came seeking you and if you show me your door again i'll take you at the word he seemed grievously put out hoots toots said he ca cannie man ca cannie bide a day or two i'm nae warlock to find a fortune for you in the bottom of a parritch bowl but just you give me a day or two and say naething to naebody and as sure as sure i'll do the right by you very well said i enough said if you want to help me there's no doubt but i'll be glad of it and none but i'll be grateful it seemed to me too soon i dare say that i was getting the upper hand of my uncle and i began next to say that i must have the bed and bedclothes aired and put to sun dry for nothing would make me sleep in such a pickle is this my house or yours said he in his keen voice and then all of a sudden broke off na na said he i didnae mean that what's mine is yours davie my man and what's yours is mine blood's thicker than water and there's naebody but you and me that ought the name and then on he rambled about the family and its ancient greatness and his father that began to enlarge the house and himself that stopped the building as a sinful waste and this put it in my head to give him jennet clouston's message the limmer he cried twelve hunner and fifteen that's every day since i had the limmer rowpit dod david i'll have her roasted on red peats before i'm by with it a witch a proclaimed witch i'll aff and see the session clerk sold up and with that he opened a chest and got out a very old and well preserved blue coat and waistcoat and a good enough beaver hat both without lace these he threw on any way and taking a staff from the cupboard locked all up again and was for setting out when a thought arrested him i cannae leave you by yoursel in the house said he i'll have to lock you out the blood came to my face if you lock me out i said it'll be the last you'll see of me in friendship he turned very pale and sucked his mouth in this is no the way he said looking wickedly at a corner of the floor this is no the way to win my favour david sir says i with a proper reverence for your age and our common blood i do not value your favour at a boddle's purchase i was brought up to have a good conceit of myself and if you were all the uncle and all the family i had in the world ten times over i wouldn't buy your liking at such prices uncle ebenezer went and looked out of the window for awhile i could see him all trembling and twitching like a man with palsy but when he turned round he had a smile upon his face well well said he we must bear and forbear i'll no go that's all that's to be said of it uncle ebenezer i said i can make nothing out of this you use me like a thief you hate to have me in this house you let me see it every word and every minute it's not possible that you can like me and as for me i've spoken to you as i never thought to speak to any man why do you seek to keep me then let me gang back let me gang back to the friends i have and that like me na na na na he said very earnestly i like you fine we'll agree fine yet and for the honour of the house i couldnae let you leave the way ye came bide here quiet there's a good lad just you bide here quiet a bittie and ye'll find that we agree well sir said i after i had thought the matter out in silence i'll stay awhile it's more just i should be helped by my own blood than strangers and if we don't agree i'll do my best it shall be through no fault of mine chapter iv i run a great danger in the house of shaws for a day that was begun so ill the day passed fairly well we had the porridge cold again at noon and hot porridge at night porridge and small beer was my uncle's diet he spoke but little and that in the same way as before shooting a question at me after a long silence and when i sought to lead him to talk about my future slipped out of it again in a room next door to the kitchen where he suffered me to go i found a great number of books both latin and english in which i took great pleasure all the afternoon indeed the time passed so lightly in this good company that i began to be almost reconciled to my residence at shaws and nothing but the sight of my uncle and his eyes playing hide and seek with mine revived the force of my distrust one thing i discovered which put me in some doubt this was an entry on the fly leaf of a chap book one of patrick walker's plainly written by my father's hand and thus conceived to my brother ebenezer on his fifth birthday now what puzzled me was this that as my father was of course the younger brother he must either have made some strange error or he must have written before he was yet five an excellent clear manly hand of writing i tried to get this out of my head but though i took down many interesting authors old and new history poetry and story book this notion of my father's hand of writing stuck to me and when at length i went back into the kitchen and sat down once more to porridge and small beer the first thing i said to uncle ebenezer was to ask him if my father had not been very quick at his book alexander no him was the reply i was far quicker mysel i was a clever chappie when i was young why i could read as soon as he could this puzzled me yet more and a thought coming into my head i asked if he and my father had been twins he jumped upon his stool and the horn spoon fell out of his hand upon the floor what gars ye ask that he said and he caught me by the breast of the jacket and looked this time straight into my eyes his own were little and light and bright like a bird's blinking and winking strangely what do you mean i asked very calmly for i was far stronger than he and not easily frightened take your hand from my jacket this is no way to behave my uncle seemed to make a great effort upon himself dod man david he said ye should nae speak to me about your father that's where the mistake is he sat awhile and shook blinking in his plate he was all the brother that ever i had he added but with no heart in his voice and then he caught up his spoon and fell to supper again but still shaking now this last passage this laying of hands upon my person and sudden profession of love for my dead father went so clean beyond my comprehension that it put me into both fear and hope on the one hand i began to think my uncle was perhaps insane and might be dangerous on the other there came up into my mind quite unbidden by me and even discouraged a story like some ballad i had heard folk singing of a poor lad that was a rightful heir and a wicked kinsman that tried to keep him from his own for why should my uncle play a part with a relative that came almost a beggar to his door unless in his heart he had some cause to fear him with this notion all unacknowledged but nevertheless getting firmly settled in my head i now began to imitate his covert looks so that we sat at table like a cat and a mouse each stealthily observing the other not another word had he to say to me black or white but was busy turning something secretly over in his mind and the longer we sat and the more i looked at him the more certain i became that the something was unfriendly to myself when he had cleared the platter he got out a single pipeful of tobacco just as in the morning turned round a stool into the chimney corner and sat awhile smoking with his back to me davie he said at length i've been thinking then he paused and said it again there's a wee bit siller that i half promised ye before ye were born he continued promised it to your father o naething legal ye understand just gentlemen daffing at their wine well i keepit that bit money separate it was a great expense but a promise is a promise and it has grown by now to be a matter of just precisely just exactly and here he paused and stumbled of just exactly forty pounds this last he rapped out with a sidelong glance over his shoulder and the next moment added almost with a scream scots the pound scots being the same thing as an english shilling the difference made by this second thought was considerable i could see besides that the whole story was a lie invented with some end which it puzzled me to guess and i made no attempt to conceal the tone of raillery in which i answered o think again sir pounds sterling i believe that's what i said returned my uncle pounds sterling and if you'll step out by to the door a minute just to see what kind of a night it is i'll get it out to ye and call ye in again i did his will smiling to myself in my contempt that he should think i was so easily to be deceived it was a dark night with a few stars low down and as i stood just outside the door i heard a hollow moaning of wind far off among the hills i said to myself there was something thundery and changeful in the weather and little knew of what a vast importance that should prove to me before the evening passed when i was called in again my uncle counted out into my hand seven and thirty golden guinea pieces the rest was in his hand in small gold and silver but his heart failed him there and he crammed the change into his pocket there said he that'll show you i'm a queer man and strange wi strangers but my word is my bond and there's the proof of it now my uncle seemed so miserly that i was struck dumb by this sudden generosity and could find no words in which to thank him no a word said he nae thanks i want nae thanks i do my duty i'm no saying that everybody would have done it but for my part though i'm a careful body too it's a pleasure to me to do the right by my brother's son and it's a pleasure to me to think that now we'll agree as such near friends should i spoke him in return as handsomely as i was able but all the while i was wondering what would come next and why he had parted with his precious guineas for as to the reason he had given a baby would have refused it presently he looked towards me sideways and see here says he tit for tat i told him i was ready to prove my gratitude in any reasonable degree and then waited looking for some monstrous demand and yet when at last he plucked up courage to speak it was only to tell me very properly as i thought that he was growing old and a little broken and that he would expect me to help him with the house and the bit garden i answered and expressed my readiness to serve well he said let's begin he pulled out of his pocket a rusty key there says he there's the key of the stair tower at the far end of the house ye can only win into it from the outside for that part of the house is no finished gang ye in there and up the stairs and bring me down the chest that's at the top there's papers in't he added can i have a light sir said i na said he very cunningly nae lights in my house very well sir said i are the stairs good they're grand said he and then as i was going keep to the wall he added there's nae bannisters but the stairs are grand underfoot out i went into the night the wind was still moaning in the distance though never a breath of it came near the house of shaws it had fallen blacker than ever and i was glad to feel along the wall till i came the length of the stairtower door at the far end of the unfinished wing i had got the key into the keyhole and had just turned it when all upon a sudden without sound of wind or thunder the whole sky lighted up with wild fire and went black again i had to put my hand over my eyes to get back to the colour of the darkness and indeed i was already half blinded when i stepped into the tower it was so dark inside it seemed a body could scarce breathe but i pushed out with foot and hand and presently struck the wall with the one and the lowermost round of the stair with the other the wall by the touch was of fine hewn stone the steps"
