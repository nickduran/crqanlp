"1" "at intervals by a horrid scream or a thunderous roar which shook the earth and always i was haunted by that inexplicable sensation that unseen eyes were watching me that soundless feet dogged my trail i am neither nervous nor highstrung but the burden of responsibility upon me weighed heavily so that i was more cautious than is my wont i turned often to right and left and rear lest i be surprised and i carried my rifle at the ready in my hand once i could have sworn that among the many creatures dimly perceived amidst the shadows of the wood i saw a human figure dart from one cover to another but i could not be sure for the most part i skirted the wood making occasional detours rather than enter those forbidding depths of gloom though many times i was forced to pass through arms of the forest which extended to the very shore of the inland sea there was so sinister a suggestion in the uncouth sounds and the vague glimpses of moving things within the forest of the menace of strange beasts and possibly still stranger men that i always breathed more freely when i had passed once more into open country i had traveled northward for perhaps an hour still haunted by the conviction that i was being stalked by some creature which kept always hidden among the trees and shrubbery to my right and a little to my rear when for the hundredth time i was attracted by a sound from that direction and turning saw some animal running rapidly through the forest toward me there was no longer any effort on its part at concealment it came on through the underbrush swiftly and i was confident that whatever it was it had finally gathered the courage to charge me boldly before it finally broke into plain view i became aware that it was not alone for a few yards in its rear a second thing thrashed through the leafy jungle evidently i was to be attacked in force by a pair of hunting beasts or men and then through the last clump of waving ferns broke the figure of the foremost creature which came leaping toward me on light feet as i stood with my rifle to my shoulder covering the point at which i had expected it would emerge i must have looked foolish indeed if my surprise and consternation were in any way reflected upon my countenance as i lowered my rifle and gazed incredulous at the lithe figure of the girl speeding swiftly in my direction but i did not have long to stand thus with lowered weapon for as she came i saw her cast an affrighted glance over her shoulder and at the same moment there broke from the jungle at the same spot at which i had seen her the hugest cat i had ever looked upon at first i took the beast for a saber tooth tiger as it was quite the most fearsome appearing beast one could imagine but it was not that dread monster of the past though quite formidable enough to satisfy the most fastidious thrill hunter on it came grim and terrible its baleful eyes glaring above its distended jaws its lips curled in a frightful snarl which exposed a whole mouthful of formidable teeth at sight of me it had abandoned its impetuous rush and was now sneaking slowly toward us while the girl a long knife in her hand took her stand bravely at my left and a little to my rear she had called something to me in a strange tongue as she raced toward me and now she spoke again but what she said i could not then of course know only that her tones were sweet well modulated and free from any suggestion of panic facing the huge cat which i now saw was an enormous panther i waited until i could place a shot where i felt it would do the most good for at best a frontal shot at any of the large carnivora is a ticklish matter i had some advantage in that the beast was not charging its head was held low and its back exposed and so at forty yards i took careful aim at its spine at the junction of neck and shoulders but at the same instant as though sensing my intention the great creature lifted its head and leaped forward in full charge to fire at that sloping forehead i knew would be worse than useless and so i quickly shifted my aim and pulled the trigger hoping against hope that the soft nosed bullet and the heavy charge of powder would have sufficient stopping effect to give me time to place a second shot in answer to the report of the rifle i had the satisfaction of seeing the brute spring into the air turning a complete somersault but it was up again almost instantly though in the brief second that it took it to scramble to its feet and get its bearings it exposed its left side fully toward me and a second bullet went crashing through its heart down it went for the second time and then up and at me the vitality of these creatures of caspak is one of the marvelous features of this strange world and bespeaks the low nervous organization of the old paleolithic life which has been so long extinct in other portions of the world i put a third bullet into the beast at three paces and then i thought that i was done for but it rolled over and stopped at my feet stone dead i found that my second bullet had torn its heart almost completely away and yet it had lived to charge ferociously upon me and but for my third shot would doubtless have slain me before it finally expired or as bowen tyler so quaintly puts it before it knew that it was dead with the panther quite evidently conscious of the fact that dissolution had overtaken it i turned toward the girl who was regarding me with evident admiration and not a little awe though i must admit that my rifle claimed quite as much of her attention as did i she was quite the most wonderful animal that i have ever looked upon and what few of her charms her apparel hid it quite effectively succeeded in accentuating a bit of soft undressed leather was caught over her left shoulder and beneath her right breast falling upon her left side to her hip and upon the right to a metal band which encircled her leg above the knee and to which the lowest point of the hide was attached about her waist was a loose leather belt to the center of which was attached the scabbard belonging to her knife there was a single armlet between her right shoulder and elbow and a series of them covered her left forearm from elbow to wrist these i learned later answered the purpose of a shield against knife attack when the left arm is raised in guard across the breast or face her masses of heavy hair were held in place by a broad metal band which bore a large triangular ornament directly in the center of her forehead this ornament appeared to be a huge turquoise while the metal of all her ornaments was beaten virgin gold inlaid in intricate design with bits of mother of pearl and tiny pieces of stone of various colors from the left shoulder depended a leopard's tail while her feet were shod with sturdy little sandals the knife was her only weapon its blade was of iron the grip was wound with hide and protected by a guard of three out bowing strips of flat iron and upon the top of the hilt was a knob of gold i took in much of this in the few seconds during which we stood facing each other and i also observed another salient feature of her appearance she was frightfully dirty her face and limbs and garment were streaked with mud and perspiration and yet even so i felt that i had never looked upon so perfect and beautiful a creature as she her figure beggars description and equally so her face were i one of these writer fellows i should probably say that her features were grecian but being neither a writer nor a poet i can do her greater justice by saying that she combined all of the finest lines that one sees in the typical american girl's face rather than the pronounced sheeplike physiognomy of the greek goddess no even the dirt couldn't hide that fact she was beautiful beyond compare as we stood looking at each other a slow smile came to her face parting her symmetrical lips and disclosing a row of strong white teeth galu she asked with rising inflection and remembering that i read in bowen's manuscript that galu seemed to indicate a higher type of man i answered by pointing to myself and repeating the word then she started off on a regular catechism if i could judge by her inflection for i certainly understood no word of what she said all the time the girl kept glancing toward the forest and at last she touched my arm and pointed in that direction turning i saw a hairy figure of a manlike thing standing watching us and presently another and another emerged from the jungle and joined the leader until there must have been at least twenty of them they were entirely naked their bodies were covered with hair and though they stood upon their feet without touching their hands to the ground they had a very ape like appearance since they stooped forward and had very long arms and quite apish features they were not pretty to look upon with their close set eyes flat noses long upper lips and protruding yellow fangs _alus_ said the girl i had reread bowen's adventures so often that i knew them almost by heart and so now i knew that i was looking upon the last remnant of that ancient man race the alus of a forgotten period the speechless man of antiquity _kazor_ cried the girl and at the same moment the alus came jabbering toward us they made strange growling barking noises as with much baring of fangs they advanced upon us they were armed only with nature's weapons powerful muscles and giant fangs yet i knew that these were quite sufficient to overcome us had we nothing better to offer in defense and so i drew my pistol and fired at the leader he dropped like a stone and the others turned and fled once again the girl smiled her slow smile and stepping closer caressed the barrel of my automatic as she did so her fingers came in contact with mine and a sudden thrill ran through me which i attributed to the fact that it had been so long since i had seen a woman of any sort or kind she said something to me in her low liquid tones but i could not understand her and then she pointed toward the north and started away i followed her for my way was north too but had it been south i still should have followed so hungry was i for human companionship in this world of beasts and reptiles and half men we walked along the girl talking a great deal and seeming mystified that i could not understand her her silvery laugh rang merrily when i in turn essayed to speak to her as though my language was the quaintest thing she ever had heard often after fruitless attempts to make me understand she would hold her palm toward me saying _galu_ and then touch my breast or arm and cry _alu_ _alu_ i knew what she meant for i had learned from bowen's narrative the negative gesture and the two words which she repeated she meant that i was no galu as i claimed but an alu or speechless one yet every time she said this she laughed again and so infectious were her tones that i could only join her it was only natural too that she should be mystified by my inability to comprehend her or to make her comprehend me for from the club men the lowest human type in caspak to have speech to the golden race of galus the tongues of the various tribes are identical except for amplifications in the rising scale of evolution she who is a galu can understand one of the bo lu and make herself understood to him or to a hatchet man a spear man or an archer the ho lus or apes the alus and myself were the only creatures of human semblance with which she could hold no converse yet it was evident that her intelligence told her that i was neither ho lu nor alu neither anthropoid ape nor speechless man yet she did not despair but set out to teach me her language and had it not been that i worried so greatly over the fate of bowen and my companions of the _toreador_ i could have wished the period of instruction prolonged i never have been what one might call a ladies man though i like their company immensely and during my college days and since have made various friends among the sex i think that i rather appeal to a certain type of girl for the reason that i never make love to them i leave that to the numerous others who do it infinitely better than i could hope to and take my pleasure out of girls society in what seem to be more rational ways dancing golfing boating riding tennis and the like yet in the company of this half naked little savage i found a new pleasure that was entirely distinct from any that i ever had experienced when she touched me i thrilled as i had never before thrilled in contact with another woman i could not quite understand it for i am sufficiently sophisticated to know that this is a symptom of love and i certainly did not love this filthy little barbarian with her broken unkempt nails and her skin so besmeared with mud and the green of crushed foliage that it was difficult to say what color it originally had been but if she was outwardly uncouth her clear eyes and strong white even teeth her silvery laugh and her queenly carriage bespoke an innate fineness which dirt could not quite successfully conceal the sun was low in the heavens when we came upon a little river which emptied into a large bay at the foot of low cliffs our journey so far had been beset with constant danger as is every journey in this frightful land i have not bored you with a recital of the wearying successions of attacks by the multitude of creatures which were constantly crossing our path or deliberately stalking us we were always upon the alert for here to paraphrase eternal vigilance is indeed the price of life i had managed to progress a little in the acquisition of a knowledge of her tongue so that i knew many of the animals and reptiles by their caspakian names and trees and ferns and grasses i knew the words for _sea_ and _river_ and _cliff_ for _sky_ and _sun_ and _cloud_ yes i was getting along finely and then it occurred to me that i didn't know my companion's name so i pointed to myself and said tom and to her and raised my eyebrows in interrogation the girl ran her fingers into that mass of hair and looked puzzled i repeated the action a dozen times tom she said finally in that clear sweet liquid voice tom i had never thought much of my name before but when she spoke it it sounded to me for the first time in my life like a mighty nice name and then she brightened suddenly and tapped her own breast and said ajor ajor i repeated and she laughed and struck her palms together well we knew each other's names now and that was some satisfaction i rather liked hers ajor and she seemed to like mine for she repeated it we came to the cliffs beside the little river where it empties into the bay with the great inland sea beyond the cliffs were weather worn and rotted and in one place a deep hollow ran back beneath the overhanging stone for several feet suggesting shelter for the night there were loose rocks strewn all about with which i might build a barricade across the entrance to the cave and so i halted there and pointed out the place to ajor trying to make her understand that we would spend the night there as soon as she grasped my meaning she assented with the caspakian equivalent of an affirmative nod and then touching my rifle motioned me to follow her to the river at the bank she paused removed her belt and dagger dropping them to the ground at her side then unfastening the lower edge of her garment from the metal leg band to which it was attached slipped it off her left shoulder and let it drop to the ground around her feet it was done so naturally so simply and so quickly that it left me gasping like a fish out of water turning she flashed a smile at me and then dived into the river and there she bathed while i stood guard over her for five or ten minutes she splashed about and when she emerged her glistening skin was smooth and white and beautiful without means of drying herself she simply ignored what to me would have seemed a necessity and in a moment was arrayed in her simple though effective costume it was now within an hour of darkness and as i was nearly famished i led the way back about a quarter of a mile to a low meadow where we had seen antelope and small horses a short time before here i brought down a young buck the report of my rifle sending the balance of the herd scampering for the woods where they were met by a chorus of hideous roars as the carnivora took advantage of their panic and leaped among them with my hunting knife i removed a hind quarter and then we returned to camp here i gathered a great quantity of wood from fallen trees ajor helping me but before i built a fire i also gathered sufficient loose rock to build my barricade against the frightful terrors of the night to come i shall never forget the expression upon ajor's face as she saw me strike a match and light the kindling beneath our camp fire it was such an expression as might transform a mortal face with awe as its owner beheld the mysterious workings of divinity it was evident that ajor was quite unfamiliar with modern methods of fire making she had thought my rifle and pistol wonderful but these tiny slivers of wood which from a magic rub brought flame to the camp hearth were indeed miracles to her as the meat roasted above the fire ajor and i tried once again to talk but though copiously filled with incentive gestures and sounds the conversation did not flourish notably and then ajor took up in earnest the task of teaching me her language she commenced as i later learned with the simplest form of speech known to caspak or for that matter to the world that employed by the bo lu i found it far from difficult and even though it was a great handicap upon my instructor that she could not speak my language she did remarkably well and demonstrated that she possessed ingenuity and intelligence of a high order after we had eaten i added to the pile of firewood so that i could replenish the fire before the entrance to our barricade believing this as good a protection against the carnivora as we could have and then ajor and i sat down before it and the lesson proceeded while from all about us came the weird and awesome noises of the caspakian night the moaning and the coughing and roaring of the tigers the panthers and the lions the barking and the dismal howling of a wolf jackal and hyaenadon the shrill shrieks of stricken prey and the hissing of the great reptiles the voice of man alone was silent but though the voice of this choir terrible rose and fell from far and near in all directions reaching at time such a tremendous volume of sound that the earth shook to it yet so engrossed was i in my lesson and in my teacher that often i was deaf to what at another time would have filled me with awe the face and voice of the beautiful girl who leaned so eagerly toward me as she tried to explain the meaning of some word or correct my pronunciation of another quite entirely occupied my every faculty of perception the firelight shone upon her animated features and sparkling eyes it accentuated the graceful motions of her gesturing arms and hands it sparkled from her white teeth and from her golden ornaments and glistened on the smooth firmness of her perfect skin i am afraid that often i was more occupied with admiration of this beautiful animal than with a desire for knowledge but be that as it may i nevertheless learned much that evening though part of what i learned had naught to do with any new language ajor seemed determined that i should speak caspakian as quickly as possible and i thought i saw in her desire a little of that all feminine trait which has come down through all the ages from the first lady of the world curiosity ajor desired that i should speak her tongue in order that she might satisfy a curiosity concerning me that was filling her to a point where she was in danger of bursting of that i was positive she was a regular little animated question mark she bubbled over with interrogations which were never to be satisfied unless i learned to speak her tongue her eyes sparkled with excitement her hand flew in expressive gestures her little tongue raced with time yet all to no avail i could say _man_ and _tree_ and _cliff_ and _lion_ and a number of other words in perfect caspakian but such a vocabulary was only tantalizing it did not lend itself well to a very general conversation and the result was that ajor would wax so wroth that she would clench her little fists and beat me on the breast as hard as ever she could and then she would sink back laughing as the humor of the situation captured her she was trying to teach me some verbs by going through the actions herself as she repeated the proper word we were very much engrossed so much so that we were giving no heed to what went on beyond our cave when ajor stopped very suddenly crying _kazor_ now she had been trying to teach me that _ju_ meant _stop_ so when she cried _kazor_ and at the same time stopped i thought for a moment that this was part of my lesson for the moment i forgot that _kazor_ means _beware_ i therefore repeated the word after her but when i saw the expression in her eyes as they were directed past me and saw her point toward the entrance to the cave i turned quickly to see a hideous face at the small aperture leading out into the night it was the fierce and snarling countenance of a gigantic bear i have hunted silvertips in the white mountains of arizona and thought them quite the largest and most formidable of big game but from the appearance of the head of this awful creature i judged that the largest grizzly i had ever seen would shrink by comparison to the dimensions of a newfoundland dog our fire was just within the cave the smoke rising through the apertures between the rocks that i had piled in such a way that they arched inward toward the cliff at the top the opening by means of which we were to reach the outside was barricaded with a few large fragments which did not by any means close it entirely but through the apertures thus left no large animal could gain ingress i had depended most however upon our fire feeling that none of the dangerous nocturnal beasts of prey would venture close to the flames in this however i was quite evidently in error for the great bear stood with his nose not a foot from the blaze which was now low owing to the fact that i had been so occupied with my lesson and my teacher that i had neglected to replenish it ajor whipped out her futile little knife and pointed to my rifle at the same time she spoke in a quite level voice entirely devoid of nervousness or any evidence of fear or panic i knew she was exhorting me to fire upon the beast but this i did not wish to do other than as a last resort for i was quite sure that even my heavy bullets would not more than further enrage him in which case he might easily force an entrance to our cave instead of firing i piled some more wood upon the fire and as the smoke and blaze arose in the beast's face it backed away growling most frightfully but i still could see two ugly points of light blazing in the outer darkness and hear its growls rumbling terrifically without for some time the creature stood there watching the entrance to our frail sanctuary while i racked my brains in futile endeavor to plan some method of defense or escape i knew full well that should the bear make a determined effort to get at us the rocks i had piled as a barrier would come tumbling down about his giant shoulders like a house of cards and that he would walk directly in upon us ajor having less knowledge of the effectiveness of firearms than i and therefore greater confidence in them entreated me to shoot the beast but i knew that the chance that i could stop it with a single shot was most remote while that i should but infuriate it was real and present and so i waited for what seemed an eternity watching those devilish points of fire glaring balefully at us and listening to the ever increasing volume of those seismic growls which seemed to rumble upward from the bowels of the earth shaking the very cliffs beneath which we cowered until at last i saw that the brute was again approaching the aperture it availed me nothing that i piled the blaze high with firewood until ajor and i were near to roasting on came that mighty engine of destruction until once again the hideous face yawned its fanged yawn directly within the barrier's opening it stood thus a moment and then the head was withdrawn i breathed a sigh of relief the thing had altered its intention and was going on in search of other and more easily procurable prey the fire had been too much for it but my joy was short lived and my heart sank once again as a moment later i saw a mighty paw insinuated into the opening a paw as large around as a large dishpan very gently the paw toyed with the great rock that partly closed the entrance pushed and pulled upon it and then very deliberately drew it outward and to one side again came the head and this time much farther into the cavern but still the great shoulders would not pass through the opening ajor moved closer to me until her shoulder touched my side and i thought i felt a slight tremor run through her body but otherwise she gave no indication of fear involuntarily i threw my left arm about her and drew her to me for an instant it was an act of reassurance rather than a caress though i must admit that again and even in the face of death i thrilled at the contact with her and then i released her and threw my rifle to my shoulder for at last i had reached the conclusion that nothing more could be gained by waiting my only hope was to get as many shots into the creature as i could before it was upon me already it had torn away a second rock and was in the very act of forcing its huge bulk through the opening it had now made so now i took careful aim between its eyes my right fingers closed firmly and evenly upon the small of the stock drawing back my trigger finger by the muscular action of the hand the bullet could not fail to hit its mark i held my breath lest i swerve the muzzle a hair by my breathing i was as steady and cool as i ever had been upon a target range and i had the full consciousness of a perfect hit in anticipation i knew that i could not miss and then as the bear surged forward toward me the hammer fell futilely upon an imperfect cartridge almost simultaneously i heard from without a"
