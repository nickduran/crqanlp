"1" "had told her the house he lived in and the next one was his own i thought the house we live in she began they're my houses those two said the mother in law and not clear either it's as much as i can do to keep the mortgage interest paid gertrude sat white and silent she was her father now then we ought to be paying you rent she said coldly walter is paying me rent replied the mother and what rent asked gertrude six and six a week retorted the mother it was more than the house was worth gertrude held her head erect looked straight before her it is lucky to be you said the elder woman bitingly to have a husband as takes all the worry of the money and leaves you a free hand the young wife was silent she said very little to her husband but her manner had changed towards him something in her proud honourable soul had crystallised out hard as rock when october came in she thought only of christmas two years ago at christmas she had met him last christmas she had married him this christmas she would bear him a child you don't dance yourself do you missis asked her nearest neighbour in october when there was great talk of opening a dancing class over the brick and tile inn at bestwood no i never had the least inclination to mrs morel replied fancy an how funny as you should ha married your mester you know he's quite a famous one for dancing i didn't know he was famous laughed mrs morel yea he is though why he ran that dancing class in the miners arms club room for over five year did he yes he did the other woman was defiant an it was thronged every tuesday and thursday an sat'day an there was carryin's on accordin to all accounts this kind of thing was gall and bitterness to mrs morel and she had a fair share of it the women did not spare her at first for she was superior though she could not help it he began to be rather late in coming home they're working very late now aren't they she said to her washer woman no later than they allers do i don't think but they stop to have their pint at ellen's an they get talkin an there you are dinner stone cold an it serves em right but mr morel does not take any drink the woman dropped the clothes looked at mrs morel then went on with her work saying nothing gertrude morel was very ill when the boy was born morel was good to her as good as gold but she felt very lonely miles away from her own people she felt lonely with him now and his presence only made it more intense the boy was small and frail at first but he came on quickly he was a beautiful child with dark gold ringlets and dark blue eyes which changed gradually to a clear grey his mother loved him passionately he came just when her own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear when her faith in life was shaken and her soul felt dreary and lonely she made much of the child and the father was jealous at last mrs morel despised her husband she turned to the child she turned from the father he had begun to neglect her the novelty of his own home was gone he had no grit she said bitterly to herself what he felt just at the minute that was all to him he could not abide by anything there was nothing at the back of all his show there began a battle between the husband and wife a fearful bloody battle that ended only with the death of one she fought to make him undertake his own responsibilities to make him fulfill his obligations but he was too different from her his nature was purely sensuous and she strove to make him moral religious she tried to force him to face things he could not endure it it drove him out of his mind while the baby was still tiny the father's temper had become so irritable that it was not to be trusted the child had only to give a little trouble when the man began to bully a little more and the hard hands of the collier hit the baby then mrs morel loathed her husband loathed him for days and he went out and drank and she cared very little what he did only on his return she scathed him with her satire the estrangement between them caused him knowingly or unknowingly grossly to offend her where he would not have done william was only one year old and his mother was proud of him he was so pretty she was not well off now but her sisters kept the boy in clothes then with his little white hat curled with an ostrich feather and his white coat he was a joy to her the twining wisps of hair clustering round his head mrs morel lay listening one sunday morning to the chatter of the father and child downstairs then she dozed off when she came downstairs a great fire glowed in the grate the room was hot the breakfast was roughly laid and seated in his armchair against the chimney piece sat morel rather timid and standing between his legs the child cropped like a sheep with such an odd round poll looking wondering at her and on a newspaper spread out upon the hearthrug a myriad of crescent shaped curls like the petals of a marigold scattered in the reddening firelight mrs morel stood still it was her first baby she went very white and was unable to speak what dost think o im morel laughed uneasily she gripped her two fists lifted them and came forward morel shrank back i could kill you i could she said she choked with rage her two fists uplifted yer non want ter make a wench on im morel said in a frightened tone bending his head to shield his eyes from hers his attempt at laughter had vanished the mother looked down at the jagged close clipped head of her child she put her hands on his hair and stroked and fondled his head oh my boy she faltered her lip trembled her face broke and snatching up the child she buried her face in his shoulder and cried painfully she was one of those women who cannot cry whom it hurts as it hurts a man it was like ripping something out of her her sobbing morel sat with his elbows on his knees his hands gripped together till the knuckles were white he gazed in the fire feeling almost stunned as if he could not breathe presently she came to an end soothed the child and cleared away the breakfast table she left the newspaper littered with curls spread upon the hearthrug at last her husband gathered it up and put it at the back of the fire she went about her work with closed mouth and very quiet morel was subdued he crept about wretchedly and his meals were a misery that day she spoke to him civilly and never alluded to what he had done but he felt something final had happened afterwards she said she had been silly that the boy's hair would have had to be cut sooner or later in the end she even brought herself to say to her husband it was just as well he had played barber when he did but she knew and morel knew that that act had caused something momentous to take place in her soul she remembered the scene all her life as one in which she had suffered the most intensely this act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her love for morel before while she had striven against him bitterly she had fretted after him as if he had gone astray from her now she ceased to fret for his love he was an outsider to her this made life much more bearable nevertheless she still continued to strive with him she still had her high moral sense inherited from generations of puritans it was now a religious instinct and she was almost a fanatic with him because she loved him or had loved him if he sinned she tortured him if he drank and lied was often a poltroon sometimes a knave she wielded the lash unmercifully the pity was she was too much his opposite she could not be content with the little he might be she would have him the much that he ought to be so in seeking to make him nobler than he could be she destroyed him she injured and hurt and scarred herself but she lost none of her worth she also had the children he drank rather heavily though not more than many miners and always beer so that whilst his health was affected it was never injured the week end was his chief carouse he sat in the miners arms until turning out time every friday every saturday and every sunday evening on monday and tuesday he had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten o'clock sometimes he stayed at home on wednesday and thursday evenings or was only out for an hour he practically never had to miss work owing to his drinking but although he was very steady at work his wages fell off he was blab mouthed a tongue wagger authority was hateful to him therefore he could only abuse the pit managers he would say in the palmerston th gaffer come down to our stall this morning an e says you know walter this ere'll not do what about these props an i says to him why what art talkin about what d'st mean about th props it'll never do this ere e says you'll be havin th roof in one o these days an i says tha'd better stan on a bit o clunch then an hold it up wi thy ead so e wor that mad e cossed an e swore an t'other chaps they did laugh morel was a good mimic he imitated the manager's fat squeaky voice with its attempt at good english i shan't have it walter who knows more about it me or you so i says i've niver fun out how much tha knows alfred it'll appen carry thee ter bed an back so morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions and some of this would be true the pit manager was not an educated man he had been a boy along with morel so that while the two disliked each other they more or less took each other for granted but alfred charlesworth did not forgive the butty these public house sayings consequently although morel was a good miner sometimes earning as much as five pounds a week when he married he came gradually to have worse and worse stalls where the coal was thin and hard to get and unprofitable also in summer the pits are slack often on bright sunny mornings the men are seen trooping home again at ten eleven or twelve o'clock no empty trucks stand at the pit mouth the women on the hillside look across as they shake the hearthrug against the fence and count the wagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley and the children as they come from school at dinner time looking down the fields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing say minton's knocked off my dad'll be at home and there is a sort of shadow over all women and children and men because money will be short at the end of the week morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week to provide everything rent food clothes clubs insurance doctors occasionally if he were flush he gave her thirty five but these occasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twenty five in winter with a decent stall the miner might earn fifty or fifty five shillings a week then he was happy on friday night saturday and sunday he spent royally getting rid of his sovereign or thereabouts and out of so much he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or bought them a pound of apples it all went in drink in the bad times matters were more worrying but he was not so often drunk so that mrs morel used to say i'm not sure i wouldn't rather be short for when he's flush there isn't a minute of peace if he earned forty shillings he kept ten from thirty five he kept five from thirty two he kept four from twenty eight he kept three from twenty four he kept two from twenty he kept one and six from eighteen he kept a shilling from sixteen he kept sixpence he never saved a penny and he gave his wife no opportunity of saving instead she had occasionally to pay his debts not public house debts for those never were passed on to the women but debts when he had bought a canary or a fancy walking stick at the wakes time morel was working badly and mrs morel was trying to save against her confinement so it galled her bitterly to think he should be out taking his pleasure and spending money whilst she remained at home harassed there were two days holiday on the tuesday morning morel rose early he was in good spirits quite early before six o'clock she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs he had a pleasant way of whistling lively and musical he nearly always whistled hymns he had been a choir boy with a beautiful voice and had taken solos in southwell cathedral his morning whistling alone betrayed it his wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden his whistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away it always gave her a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay in bed the children not yet awake in the bright early morning happy in his man's fashion at nine o'clock while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting playing on the sofa and the mother was washing up he came in from his carpentry his sleeves rolled up his waistcoat hanging open he was still a good looking man with black wavy hair and a large black moustache his face was perhaps too much inflamed and there was about him a look almost of peevishness but now he was jolly he went straight to the sink where his wife was washing up what are thee there he said boisterously sluthe off an let me wesh mysen you may wait till i've finished said his wife oh mun i an what if i shonna this good humoured threat amused mrs morel then you can go and wash yourself in the soft water tub ha i can an a tha mucky little ussy with which he stood watching her a moment then went away to wait for her when he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant usually he preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck now however he made a toilet there seemed so much gusto in the way he puffed and swilled as he washed himself so much alacrity with which he hurried to the mirror in the kitchen and bending because it was too low for him scrupulously parted his wet black hair that it irritated mrs morel he put on a turn down collar a black bow and wore his sunday tail coat as such he looked spruce and what his clothes would not do his instinct for making the most of his good looks would at half past nine jerry purdy came to call for his pal jerry was morel's bosom friend and mrs morel disliked him he was a tall thin man with a rather foxy face the kind of face that seems to lack eyelashes he walked with a stiff brittle dignity as if his head were on a wooden spring his nature was cold and shrewd generous where he intended to be generous he seemed to be very fond of morel and more or less to take charge of him mrs morel hated him she had known his wife who had died of consumption and who had at the end conceived such a violent dislike of her husband that if he came into her room it caused her haemorrhage none of which jerry had seemed to mind and now his eldest daughter a girl of fifteen kept a poor house for him and looked after the two younger children a mean wizzen hearted stick mrs morel said of him i've never known jerry mean in my life protested morel a opener handed and more freer chap you couldn't find anywhere accordin to my knowledge open handed to you retorted mrs morel but his fist is shut tight enough to his children poor things poor things and what for are they poor things i should like to know but mrs morel would not be appeased on jerry's score the subject of argument was seen craning his thin neck over the scullery curtain he caught mrs morel's eye mornin missis mester in yes he is jerry entered unasked and stood by the kitchen doorway he was not invited to sit down but stood there coolly asserting the rights of men and husbands a nice day he said to mrs morel yes grand out this morning grand for a walk do you mean you're going for a walk she asked yes we mean walkin to nottingham he replied h'm the two men greeted each other both glad jerry however full of assurance morel rather subdued afraid to seem too jubilant in presence of his wife but he laced his boots quickly with spirit they were going for a ten mile walk across the fields to nottingham climbing the hillside from the bottoms they mounted gaily into the morning at the moon and stars they had their first drink then on to the old spot then a long five miles of drought to carry them into bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter but they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full so that when they came in sight of the city morel was sleepy the town spread upwards before them smoking vaguely in the midday glare fridging the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks and chimneys in the last field morel lay down under an oak tree and slept soundly for over an hour when he rose to go forward he felt queer the two had dinner in the meadows with jerry's sister then repaired to the punch bowl where they mixed in the excitement of pigeon racing morel never in his life played cards considering them as having some occult malevolent power the devil's pictures he called them but he was a master of skittles and of dominoes he took a challenge from a newark man on skittles all the men in the old long bar took sides betting either one way or the other morel took off his coat jerry held the hat containing the money the men at the tables watched some stood with their mugs in their hands morel felt his big wooden ball carefully then launched it he played havoc among the nine pins and won half a crown which restored him to solvency by seven o'clock the two were in good condition they caught the 7.30 train home in the afternoon the bottoms was intolerable every inhabitant remaining was out of doors the women in twos and threes bareheaded and in white aprons gossiped in the alley between the blocks men having a rest between drinks sat on their heels and talked the place smelled stale the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat mrs morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows which were not more than two hundred yards away the water ran quickly over stones and broken pots mother and child leaned on the rail of the old sheep bridge watching up at the dipping hole at the other end of the meadow mrs morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the deep yellow water or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over the blackish stagnant meadow she knew william was at the dipping hole and it was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned annie played under the tall old hedge picking up alder cones that she called currants the child required much attention and the flies were teasing the children were put to bed at seven o'clock then she worked awhile when walter morel and jerry arrived at bestwood they felt a load off their minds a railway journey no longer impended so they could put the finishing touches to a glorious day they entered the nelson with the satisfaction of returned travellers the next day was a work day and the thought of it put a damper on the men's spirits most of them moreover had spent their money some were already rolling dismally home to sleep in preparation for the morrow mrs morel listening to their mournful singing went indoors nine o'clock passed and ten and still the pair had not returned on a doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly in a drawl lead kindly light mrs morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they must sing that hymn when they got maudlin as if genevieve weren't good enough she said the kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops on the hob a large black saucepan steamed slowly mrs morel took a panchion a great bowl of thick red earth streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom and then straining herself to the weight was pouring in the liquor just then morel came in he had been very jolly in the nelson but coming home had grown irritable he had not quite got over the feeling of irritability and pain after having slept on the ground when he was so hot and a bad conscience afflicted him as he neared the house he did not know he was angry but when the garden gate resisted his attempts to open it he kicked it and broke the latch he entered just as mrs morel was pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan swaying slightly he lurched against the table the boiling liquor pitched mrs morel started back good gracious she cried coming home in his drunkenness comin home in his what he snarled his hat over his eye suddenly her blood rose in a jet say you're not drunk she flashed she had put down her saucepan and was stirring the sugar into the beer he dropped his two hands heavily on the table and thrust his face forwards at her say you're not drunk he repeated why nobody but a nasty little bitch like you ud ave such a thought he thrust his face forward at her there's money to bezzle with if there's money for nothing else i've not spent a two shillin bit this day he said you don't get as drunk as a lord on nothing she replied and she cried flashing into sudden fury if you've been sponging on your beloved jerry why let him look after his children for they need it it's a lie it's a lie shut your face woman they were now at battle pitch each forgot everything save the hatred of the other and the battle between them she was fiery and furious as he they went on till he called her a liar no she cried starting up scarce able to breathe don't call me that you the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoe leather she forced the last words out of suffocated lungs you're a liar he yelled banging the table with his fist you're a liar you're a liar she stiffened herself with clenched fists the house is filthy with you she cried then get out on it it's mine get out on it he shouted it's me as brings th money whoam not thee it's my house not thine then ger out on't ger out on't and i would she cried suddenly shaken into tears of impotence ah wouldn't i wouldn't i have gone long ago but for those children ay haven't i repented not going years ago when i'd only the one suddenly drying into rage do you think it's for you i stop do you think i'd stop one minute for you go then he shouted beside himself go no she faced round no she cried loudly you shan't have it all your own way you shan't do all you like i've got those children to see to my word she laughed i should look well to leave them to you go he cried thickly lifting his fist he was afraid of her go i should be only too glad i should laugh laugh my lord if i could get away from you she replied he came up to her his red face with its bloodshot eyes thrust forward and gripped her arms she cried in fear of him struggled to be free coming slightly to himself panting he pushed her roughly to the outer door and thrust her forth slotting the bolt behind her with a bang then he went back into the kitchen dropped into his armchair his head bursting full of blood sinking between his knees thus he dipped gradually into a stupor from exhaustion and intoxication the moon was high and magnificent in the august night mrs morel seared with passion shivered to find herself out there in a great white light that fell cold on her and gave a shock to her inflamed soul she stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great rhubarb leaves near the door then she got the air into her breast she walked down the garden path trembling in every limb while the child boiled within her for a while she could not control her consciousness mechanically she went over the last scene then over it again certain phrases certain moments coming each time like a brand red hot down on her soul and each time she enacted again the past hour each time the brand came down at the same points till the mark was burnt in and the pain burnt out and at last she came to herself she must have been half an hour in this delirious condition then the presence of the night came again to her she glanced round in fear she had wandered to the side garden where she was walking up and down the path beside the currant bushes under the long wall the garden was a narrow strip bounded from the road that cut transversely between the blocks by a thick thorn hedge she hurried out of the side garden to the front where she could stand as if in an immense gulf of white light the moon streaming high in face of her the moonlight standing up from the hills in front and filling the valley where the bottoms crouched almost blindingly there panting and half weeping in reaction from the stress she murmured to herself over and over again the nuisance the nuisance she became aware of something about her with an effort she roused herself to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness the tall white lilies were reeling in the moonlight and the air was charged with their perfume as with a presence mrs morel gasped slightly in fear she touched the big pallid flowers on their petals then shivered they seemed to be stretching in the moonlight she put her hand into one white bin the gold scarcely showed on her fingers by moonlight she bent down to look at the binful of yellow pollen but it only appeared dusky then she drank a deep draught of the scent it almost made her dizzy mrs morel leaned on the garden gate looking out and she lost herself awhile she did not know what she thought except for a slight feeling of sickness and her consciousness in the child herself melted out like scent into the shiny pale air after a time the child too melted with her in the mixing pot of moonlight and she rested with the hills and lilies and houses all swum together in a kind of swoon when she came to herself she was tired for sleep languidly she looked about her the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spread with linen a moth ricochetted over them and right across the garden following it with her eye roused her a few whiffs of the raw strong scent of phlox invigorated her she passed along the path hesitating at the white rose bush it smelled sweet and simple she touched the white ruffles of the roses their fresh scent and cool soft leaves reminded her of the morning time and sunshine she was very fond of them but she was tired and wanted to sleep in the mysterious out of doors she felt forlorn there was no noise anywhere evidently the children had not been wakened or had gone to sleep again a train three miles away roared across"
