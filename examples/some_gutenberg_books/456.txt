"1" "very sweet to me very fine but remote my grip was fixing now upon the world i saw another door opening the door of my career he stared again into the fire its red lights picked out a stubborn strength in his face for just one flickering moment and then it vanished again well he said and sighed i have served that career i have done much work much hard work but i have dreamt of the enchanted garden a thousand dreams and seen its door or at least glimpsed its door four times since then yes four times for a while this world was so bright and interesting seemed so full of meaning and opportunity that the half effaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and remote who wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty women and distinguished men i came down to london from oxford a man of bold promise that i have done something to redeem something and yet there have been disappointments twice i have been in love i will not dwell on that but once as i went to someone who i know doubted whether i dared to come i took a short cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near earl's court and so happened on a white wall and a familiar green door odd said i to myself but i thought this place was on campden hill it's the place i never could find somehow like counting stonehenge the place of that queer day dream of mine and i went by it intent upon my purpose it had no appeal to me that afternoon i had just a moment's impulse to try the door three steps aside were needed at the most though i was sure enough in my heart that it would open to me and then i thought that doing so might delay me on the way to that appointment in which i thought my honour was involved afterwards i was sorry for my punctuality i might at least have peeped in i thought and waved a hand to those panthers but i knew enough by this time not to seek again belatedly that which is not found by seeking yes that time made me very sorry years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door it's only recently it has come back to me with it there has come a sense as though some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world i began to think of it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that i should never see that door again perhaps i was suffering a little from overwork perhaps it was what i've heard spoken of as the feeling of forty i don't know but certainly the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things recently and that just at a time with all these new political developments when i ought to be working odd isn't it but i do begin to find life toilsome its rewards as i come near them cheap i began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly yes and i've seen it three times the garden no the door and i haven't gone in he leaned over the table to me with an enormous sorrow in his voice as he spoke thrice i have had my chance _thrice if ever that door offers itself to me again i swore i will go in out of this dust and heat out of this dry glitter of vanity out of these toilsome futilities i will go and never return this time i will stay i swore it and when the time came _i didn't go_ three times in one year have i passed that door and failed to enter three times in the last year the first time was on the night of the snatch division on the tenants redemption bill on which the government was saved by a majority of three you remember no one on our side perhaps very few on the opposite side expected the end that night then the debate collapsed like eggshells i and hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at brentford we were both unpaired and we were called up by telephone and set off at once in his cousin's motor we got in barely in time and on the way we passed my wall and door livid in the moonlight blotched with hot yellow as the glare of our lamps lit it but unmistakable my god cried i what said hotchkiss nothing i answered and the moment passed i've made a great sacrifice i told the whip as i got in they all have he said and hurried by i do not see how i could have done otherwise then and the next occasion was as i rushed to my father's bedside to bid that stern old man farewell then too the claims of life were imperative but the third time was different it happened a week ago it fills me with hot remorse to recall it i was with gurker and ralphs it's no secret now you know that i've had my talk with gurker we had been dining at frobisher's and the talk had become intimate between us the question of my place in the reconstructed ministry lay always just over the boundary of the discussion yes yes that's all settled it needn't be talked about yet but there's no reason to keep a secret from you yes thanks thanks but let me tell you my story then on that night things were very much in the air my position was a very delicate one i was keenly anxious to get some definite word from gurker but was hampered by ralphs presence i was using the best power of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too obviously directed to the point that concerns me i had to ralphs behaviour since has more than justified my caution ralphs i knew would leave us beyond the kensington high street and then i could surprise gurker by a sudden frankness one has sometimes to resort to these little devices and then it was that in the margin of my field of vision i became aware once more of the white wall the green door before us down the road we passed it talking i passed it i can still see the shadow of gurker's marked profile his opera hat tilted forward over his prominent nose the many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow and ralphs as we sauntered past i passed within twenty inches of the door if i say good night to them and go in i asked myself what will happen and i was all a tingle for that word with gurker i could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems they will think me mad i thought and suppose i vanish now amazing disappearance of a prominent politician that weighed with me a thousand inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that crisis then he turned on me with a sorrowful smile and speaking slowly here i am he said here i am he repeated and my chance has gone from me three times in one year the door has been offered me the door that goes into peace into delight into a beauty beyond dreaming a kindness no man on earth can know and i have rejected it redmond and it has gone how do you know i know i know i am left now to work it out to stick to the tasks that held me so strongly when my moments came you say i have success this vulgar tawdry irksome envied thing i have it he had a walnut in his big hand if that was my success he said and crushed it and held it out for me to see let me tell you something redmond this loss is destroying me for two months for ten weeks nearly now i have done no work at all except the most necessary and urgent duties my soul is full of inappeasable regrets at nights when it is less likely i shall be recognised i go out i wander yes i wonder what people would think of that if they knew a cabinet minister the responsible head of that most vital of all departments wandering alone grieving sometimes near audibly lamenting for a door for a garden iv i can see now his rather pallid face and the unfamiliar sombre fire that had come into his eyes i see him very vividly to night i sit recalling his words his tones and last evening's _westminster gazette_ still lies on my sofa containing the notice of his death at lunch to day the club was busy with him and the strange riddle of his fate they found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation near east kensington station it is one of two shafts that have been made in connection with an extension of the railway southward it is protected from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high road in which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some of the workmen who live in that direction the doorway was left unfastened through a misunderstanding between two gangers and through it he made his way my mind is darkened with questions and riddles it would seem he walked all the way from the house that night he has frequently walked home during the past session and so it is i figure his dark form coming along the late and empty streets wrapped up intent and then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat the rough planking into a semblance of white did that fatal unfastened door awaken some memory was there after all ever any green door in the wall at all i do not know i have told his story as he told it to me there are times when i believe that wallace was no more than the victim of the coincidence between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination and a careless trap but that indeed is not my profoundest belief you may think me superstitious if you will and foolish but indeed i am more than half convinced that he had in truth an abnormal gift and a sense something i know not what that in the guise of wall and door offered him an outlet a secret and peculiar passage of escape into another and altogether more beautiful world at any rate you will say it betrayed him in the end but did it betray him there you touch the inmost mystery of these dreamers these men of vision and the imagination we see our world fair and common the hoarding and the pit by our daylight standard he walked out of security into darkness danger and death but did he see like that the star it was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made almost simultaneously from three observatories that the motion of the planet neptune the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun had become very erratic ogilvy had already called attention to a suspected retardation in its velocity in december such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet neptune nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any very great excitement scientific people however found the intelligence remarkable enough even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets and that the deflection of neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of the solar system the sun with its specks of planets its dust of planetoids and its impalpable comets swims in a vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination beyond the orbit of neptune there is space vacant so far as human observation has penetrated without warmth or light or sound blank emptiness for twenty million times a million miles that is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of the stars is attained and saving a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame no matter had ever to human knowledge crossed this gulf of space until early in the twentieth century this strange wanderer appeared a vast mass of matter it was bulky heavy rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into the radiance of the sun by the second day it was clearly visible to any decent instrument as a speck with a barely sensible diameter in the constellation leo near regulus in a little while an opera glass could attain it on the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual apparition in the heavens a planetary collision one london paper headed the news and proclaimed duchaine's opinion that this strange new planet would probably collide with neptune the leader writers enlarged upon the topic so that in most of the capitals of the world on january 3rd there was an expectation however vague of some imminent phenomenon in the sky and as the night followed the sunset round the globe thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see the old familiar stars just as they had always been until it was dawn in london and pollux setting and the stars overhead grown pale the winter's dawn it was a sickly filtering accumulation of daylight and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to show where people were astir but the yawning policeman saw the thing the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape workmen going to their work betimes milkmen the drivers of news carts dissipation going home jaded and pale homeless wanderers sentinels on their beats and in the country labourers trudging afield poachers slinking home all over the dusky quickening country it could be seen and out at sea by seamen watching for the day a great white star come suddenly into the westward sky brighter it was than any star in our skies brighter than the evening star at its brightest it still glowed out white and large no mere twinkling spot of light but a small round clear shining disc an hour after the day had come and where science has not reached men stared and feared telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the heavens sturdy boers dusky hottentots gold coast negroes frenchmen spaniards portuguese stood in the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star and in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement rising almost to shouting pitch as the two remote bodies had rushed together and a hurrying to and fro to gather photographic apparatus and spectroscope and this appliance and that to record this novel astonishing sight the destruction of a world for it was a world a sister planet of our earth far greater than our earth indeed that had so suddenly flashed into flaming death neptune it was had been struck fairly and squarely by the strange planet from outer space and the heat of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast mass of incandescence round the world that day two hours before the dawn went the pallid great white star fading only as it sank westward and the sun mounted above it everywhere men marvelled at it but of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those sailors habitual watchers of the stars who far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night and when next it rose over europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on hilly slopes on house roofs in open spaces staring eastward for the rising of the great new star it rose with a white glow in front of it like the glare of a white fire and those who had seen it come into existence the night before cried out at the sight of it it is larger they cried it is brighter and indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange new star it is brighter cried the people clustering in the streets but in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one another _it is nearer_ they said _nearer and voice after voice repeated it is nearer and the clicking telegraph took that up and it trembled along telephone wires and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type it is nearer men writing in offices struck with a strange realisation flung down their pens men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in those words it is nearer it hurried along wakening streets it was shouted down the frost stilled ways of quiet villages men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellow lit doorways shouting the news to the passersby it is nearer pretty women flushed and glittering heard the news told jestingly between the dances and feigned an intelligent interest they did not feel nearer indeed how curious how very very clever people must be to find out things like that lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to comfort themselves looking skyward it has need to be nearer for the night's as cold as charity don't seem much warmth from it if it _is_ nearer all the same what is a new star to me cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her dead the schoolboy rising early for his examination work puzzled it out for himself with the great white star shining broad and bright through the frost flowers of his window centrifugal centripetal he said with his chin on his fist stop a planet in its flight rob it of its centrifugal force what then centripetal has it and down it falls into the sun and this do _we_ come in the way i wonder the light of that day went the way of its brethren and with the later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again and it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself hanging huge in the sunset in a south african city a great man had married and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride even the skies have illuminated said the flatterer under capricorn two negro lovers daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one another crouched together in a cane brake where the fire flies hovered that is our star they whispered and felt strangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light the master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers from him his calculations were already finished in a small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active for four long nights each day serene explicit patient as ever he had given his lecture to his students and then had come back at once to this momentous calculation his face was grave a little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity for some time he seemed lost in thought then he went to the window and the blind went up with a click half way up the sky over the clustering roofs chimneys and steeples of the city hung the star he looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy you may kill me he said after a silence but i can hold you and all the universe for that matter in the grip of this little brain i would not change even now he looked at the little phial there will be no need of sleep again he said the next day at noon punctual to the minute he entered his lecture theatre put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was and carefully selected a large piece of chalk it was a joke among his students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply he came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers of young fresh faces and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of phrasing circumstances have arisen circumstances beyond my control he said and paused which will debar me from completing the course i had designed it would seem gentlemen if i may put the thing clearly and briefly that man has lived in vain the students glanced at one another had they heard aright mad raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were but one or two faces remained intent upon his calm grey fringed face it will be interesting he was saying to devote this morning to an exposition so far as i can make it clear to you of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion let us assume he turned towards the blackboard meditating a diagram in the way that was usual to him what was that about lived in vain whispered one student to another listen said the other nodding towards the lecturer and presently they began to understand that night the star rose later for its proper eastward motion had carried it some way across leo towards virgo and its brightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose and every star was hidden in its turn save only jupiter near the zenith capella aldebaran sirius and the pointers of the bear it was very white and beautiful in many parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about it was perceptibly larger in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon the frost was still on the ground in england but the world was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight one could see to read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan and everywhere the world was awake that night and throughout christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country side like the belling of bees in the heather and this murmurous tumult grew to a clangour in the cities it was the tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and steeples summoning the people to sleep no more to sin no more but to gather in their churches and pray and overhead growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed rose the dazzling star and the streets and houses were alight in all the cities the shipyards glared and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all night long and in all the seas about the civilised lands ships with throbbing engines and ships with bellying sails crowded with men and living creatures were standing out to ocean and the north for already the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the world and translated into a hundred tongues the new planet and neptune locked in a fiery embrace were whirling headlong ever faster and faster towards the sun already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles and every second its terrific velocity increased as it flew now indeed it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it but near its destined path as yet only slightly perturbed spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid round the sun every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger and the result of that attraction inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit into an elliptical path and the burning star swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush would describe a curved path and perhaps collide with and certainly pass very close to our earth earthquakes volcanic outbreaks cyclones sea waves floods and a steady rise in temperature to i know not what limit so prophesied the master mathematician and overhead to carry out his words lonely and cold and livid blazed the star of the coming doom to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that it was visibly approaching and that night too the weather changed and the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england softened towards a thaw but you must not imagine because i have spoken of people praying through the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing toward mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star as a matter of fact use and wont still ruled the world and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations in all the cities the shops save one here and there opened and closed at their proper hours the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades the workers gathered in the factories soldiers drilled scholars studied lovers sought one another thieves lurked and fled politicians planned their schemes the presses of the newspapers roared through the night and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic the newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000 for then too people had anticipated the end the star was no star mere gas a comet and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth there was no precedent for such a thing common sense was sturdy everywhere scornful jesting a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful that night at seven fifteen by greenwich time the star would be at its nearest to jupiter then the world would see the turn things would take the master mathematician's grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate self advertisement common sense at last a little heated by argument signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed so too barbarism and savagery already tired of the novelty went about their nightly business and save for a howling dog here and there the beast world left the star unheeded and yet when at last the watchers in the european states saw the star rise an hour later it is true but no larger than it had been the night before there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematician to take the danger as if it had passed but hereafter the laughter ceased the star grew it grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour a little larger each hour a little nearer the midnight zenith and brighter and brighter until it had turned night into a second day had it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path had it lost no velocity to jupiter it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet the next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to english eyes and the thaw was assured it rose over america near the size of the moon but blinding white to look at and _hot_ and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength and in virginia and brazil and down the st lawrence valley it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunder clouds flickering violet lightning and hail unprecedented in manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods and upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that night and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid and soon in their upper reaches with swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men they rose steadily steadily in the ghostly brilliance and came trickling over their banks at last behind the flying population of their valleys and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic the tides were higher than had ever been in the memory of man and the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland drowning whole cities and so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow the earthquakes began and grew until all down america from the arctic circle to cape horn hillsides were sliding fissures were opening and houses and walls crumbling to destruction the whole side of cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in"
