"1" "only revealed by memory not detected by sight wooed from day to day by the changing hours but responding with no change in themselves left for ever grim and sullen after the flush of morning the winged gleams of the april noonday the parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun and directly below them the eye rested on a more advanced line of hanging woods divided by bright patches of pasture or furrowed crops and not yet deepened into the uniform leafy curtains of high summer but still showing the warm tints of the young oak and the tender green of the ash and lime then came the valley where the woods grew thicker as if they had rolled down and hurried together from the patches left smooth on the slope that they might take the better care of the tall mansion which lifted its parapets and sent its faint blue summer smoke among them doubtless there was a large sweep of park and a broad glassy pool in front of that mansion but the swelling slope of meadow would not let our traveller see them from the village green he saw instead a foreground which was just as lovely the level sunlight lying like transparent gold among the gently curving stems of the feathered grass and the tall red sorrel and the white ambels of the hemlocks lining the bushy hedgerows it was that moment in summer when the sound of the scythe being whetted makes us cast more lingering looks at the flower sprinkled tresses of the meadows he might have seen other beauties in the landscape if he had turned a little in his saddle and looked eastward beyond jonathan burge's pasture and woodyard towards the green corn fields and walnut trees of the hall farm but apparently there was more interest for him in the living groups close at hand every generation in the village was there from old feyther taft in his brown worsted night cap who was bent nearly double but seemed tough enough to keep on his legs a long while leaning on his short stick down to the babies with their little round heads lolling forward in quilted linen caps now and then there was a new arrival perhaps a slouching labourer who having eaten his supper came out to look at the unusual scene with a slow bovine gaze willing to hear what any one had to say in explanation of it but by no means excited enough to ask a question but all took care not to join the methodists on the green and identify themselves in that way with the expectant audience for there was not one of them that would not have disclaimed the imputation of having come out to hear the preacher woman they had only come out to see what war a goin on like the men were chiefly gathered in the neighbourhood of the blacksmith's shop but do not imagine them gathered in a knot villagers never swarm a whisper is unknown among them and they seem almost as incapable of an undertone as a cow or a stag your true rustic turns his back on his interlocutor throwing a question over his shoulder as if he meant to run away from the answer and walking a step or two farther off when the interest of the dialogue culminates so the group in the vicinity of the blacksmith's door was by no means a close one and formed no screen in front of chad cranage the blacksmith himself who stood with his black brawny arms folded leaning against the door post and occasionally sending forth a bellowing laugh at his own jokes giving them a marked preference over the sarcasms of wiry ben who had renounced the pleasures of the holly bush for the sake of seeing life under a new form but both styles of wit were treated with equal contempt by mr joshua rann mr rann's leathern apron and subdued griminess can leave no one in any doubt that he is the village shoemaker the thrusting out of his chin and stomach and the twirling of his thumbs are more subtle indications intended to prepare unwary strangers for the discovery that they are in the presence of the parish clerk old joshway as he is irreverently called by his neighbours is in a state of simmering indignation but he has not yet opened his lips except to say in a resounding bass undertone like the tuning of a violoncello sehon king of the amorites for his mercy endureth for ever and og the king of basan for his mercy endureth for ever a quotation which may seem to have slight bearing on the present occasion but as with every other anomaly adequate knowledge will show it to be a natural sequence mr rann was inwardly maintaining the dignity of the church in the face of this scandalous irruption of methodism and as that dignity was bound up with his own sonorous utterance of the responses his argument naturally suggested a quotation from the psalm he had read the last sunday afternoon the stronger curiosity of the women had drawn them quite to the edge of the green where they could examine more closely the quakerlike costume and odd deportment of the female methodists underneath the maple there was a small cart which had been brought from the wheelwright's to serve as a pulpit and round this a couple of benches and a few chairs had been placed some of the methodists were resting on these with their eyes closed as if wrapt in prayer or meditation others chose to continue standing and had turned their faces towards the villagers with a look of melancholy compassion which was highly amusing to bessy cranage the blacksmith's buxom daughter known to her neighbours as chad's bess who wondered why the folks war amakin faces a that'ns chad's bess was the object of peculiar compassion because her hair being turned back under a cap which was set at the top of her head exposed to view an ornament of which she was much prouder than of her red cheeks namely a pair of large round ear rings with false garnets in them ornaments condemned not only by the methodists but by her own cousin and namesake timothy's bess who with much cousinly feeling often wished them ear rings might come to good timothy's bess though retaining her maiden appellation among her familiars had long been the wife of sandy jim and possessed a handsome set of matronly jewels of which it is enough to mention the heavy baby she was rocking in her arms and the sturdy fellow of five in knee breeches and red legs who had a rusty milk can round his neck by way of drum and was very carefully avoided by chad's small terrier this young olive branch notorious under the name of timothy's bess's ben being of an inquiring disposition unchecked by any false modesty had advanced beyond the group of women and children and was walking round the methodists looking up in their faces with his mouth wide open and beating his stick against the milk can by way of musical accompaniment but one of the elderly women bending down to take him by the shoulder with an air of grave remonstrance timothy's bess's ben first kicked out vigorously then took to his heels and sought refuge behind his father's legs ye gallows young dog said sandy jim with some paternal pride if ye donna keep that stick quiet i'll tek it from ye what dy'e mane by kickin foulks here gie him here to me jim said chad cranage i'll tie hirs up an shoe him as i do th hosses well mester casson he continued as that personage sauntered up towards the group of men how are ye t naight are ye coom t help groon they say folks allays groon when they're hearkenin to th methodys as if they war bad i th inside i mane to groon as loud as your cow did th other naight an then the praicher ull think i'm i th raight way i'd advise you not to be up to no nonsense chad said mr casson with some dignity poyser wouldn't like to hear as his wife's niece was treated any ways disrespectful for all he mayn't be fond of her taking on herself to preach aye an she's a pleasant looked un too said wiry ben i'll stick up for the pretty women preachin i know they'd persuade me over a deal sooner nor th ugly men i shouldna wonder if i turn methody afore the night's out an begin to coort the preacher like seth bede why seth's looking rether too high i should think said mr casson this woman's kin wouldn't like her to demean herself to a common carpenter tchu said ben with a long treble intonation what's folks's kin got to do wi't not a chip poyser's wife may turn her nose up an forget bygones but this dinah morris they tell me s as poor as iver she was works at a mill an's much ado to keep hersen a strappin young carpenter as is a ready made methody like seth wouldna be a bad match for her why poysers make as big a fuss wi adam bede as if he war a nevvy o their own idle talk idle talk said mr joshua rann adam an seth's two men you wunna fit them two wi the same last maybe said wiry ben contemptuously but seth's the lad for me though he war a methody twice o'er i'm fair beat wi seth for i've been teasin him iver sin we've been workin together an he bears me no more malice nor a lamb an he's a stout hearted feller too for when we saw the old tree all afire a comin across the fields one night an we thought as it war a boguy seth made no more ado but he up to't as bold as a constable why there he comes out o will maskery's an there's will hisself lookin as meek as if he couldna knock a nail o the head for fear o hurtin't an there's the pretty preacher woman my eye she's got her bonnet off i mun go a bit nearer several of the men followed ben's lead and the traveller pushed his horse on to the green as dinah walked rather quickly and in advance of her companions towards the cart under the maple tree while she was near seth's tall figure she looked short but when she had mounted the cart and was away from all comparison she seemed above the middle height of woman though in reality she did not exceed it an effect which was due to the slimness of her figure and the simple line of her black stuff dress the stranger was struck with surprise as he saw her approach and mount the cart surprise not so much at the feminine delicacy of her appearance as at the total absence of self consciousness in her demeanour he had made up his mind to see her advance with a measured step and a demure solemnity of countenance he had felt sure that her face would be mantled with the smile of conscious saintship or else charged with denunciatory bitterness he knew but two types of methodist the ecstatic and the bilious but dinah walked as simply as if she were going to market and seemed as unconscious of her outward appearance as a little boy there was no blush no tremulousness which said i know you think me a pretty woman too young to preach no casting up or down of the eyelids no compression of the lips no attitude of the arms that said but you must think of me as a saint she held no book in her ungloved hands but let them hang down lightly crossed before her as she stood and turned her grey eyes on the people there was no keenness in the eyes they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out rather than impressed by external objects she stood with her left hand towards the descending sun and leafy boughs screened her from its rays but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness like flowers at evening it was a small oval face of a uniform transparent whiteness with an egg like line of cheek and chin a full but firm mouth a delicate nostril and a low perpendicular brow surmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair the hair was drawn straight back behind the ears and covered except for an inch or two above the brow by a net quaker cap the eyebrows of the same colour as the hair were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled the eyelashes though no darker were long and abundant nothing was left blurred or unfinished it was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals the eyes had no peculiar beauty beyond that of expression they looked so simple so candid so gravely loving that no accusing scowl no light sneer could help melting away before their glance joshua rann gave a long cough as if he were clearing his throat in order to come to a new understanding with himself chad cranage lifted up his leather skull cap and scratched his head and wiry ben wondered how seth had the pluck to think of courting her a sweet woman the stranger said to himself but surely nature never meant her for a preacher perhaps he was one of those who think that nature has theatrical properties and with the considerate view of facilitating art and psychology makes up her characters so that there may be no mistake about them but dinah began to speak dear friends she said in a clear but not loud voice let us pray for a blessing she closed her eyes and hanging her head down a little continued in the same moderate tone as if speaking to some one quite near her saviour of sinners when a poor woman laden with sins went out to the well to draw water she found thee sitting at the well she knew thee not she had not sought thee her mind was dark her life was unholy but thou didst speak to her thou didst teach her thou didst show her that her life lay open before thee and yet thou wast ready to give her that blessing which she had never sought jesus thou art in the midst of us and thou knowest all men if there is any here like that poor woman if their minds are dark their lives unholy if they have come out not seeking thee not desiring to be taught deal with them according to the free mercy which thou didst show to her speak to them lord open their ears to my message bring their sins to their minds and make them thirst for that salvation which thou art ready to give lord thou art with thy people still they see thee in the night watches and their hearts burn within them as thou talkest with them by the way and thou art near to those who have not known thee open their eyes that they may see thee see thee weeping over them and saying ye will not come unto me that ye might have life see thee hanging on the cross and saying father forgive them for they know not what they do see thee as thou wilt come again in thy glory to judge them at the last amen dinah opened her eyes again and paused looking at the group of villagers who were now gathered rather more closely on her right hand dear friends she began raising her voice a little you have all of you been to church and i think you must have heard the clergyman read these words the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor jesus christ spoke those words he said he came to preach the gospel to the poor i don't know whether you ever thought about those words much but i will tell you when i remember first hearing them it was on just such a sort of evening as this when i was a little girl and my aunt as brought me up took me to hear a good man preach out of doors just as we are here i remember his face well he was a very old man and had very long white hair his voice was very soft and beautiful not like any voice i had ever heard before i was a little girl and scarcely knew anything and this old man seemed to me such a different sort of a man from anybody i had ever seen before that i thought he had perhaps come down from the sky to preach to us and i said aunt will he go back to the sky to night like the picture in the bible that man of god was mr wesley who spent his life in doing what our blessed lord did preaching the gospel to the poor and he entered into his rest eight years ago i came to know more about him years after but i was a foolish thoughtless child then and i remembered only one thing he told us in his sermon he told us as gospel meant good news the gospel you know is what the bible tells us about god think of that now jesus christ did really come down from heaven as i like a silly child thought mr wesley did and what he came down for was to tell good news about god to the poor why you and me dear friends are poor we have been brought up in poor cottages and have been reared on oat cake and lived coarse and we haven't been to school much nor read books and we don't know much about anything but what happens just round us we are just the sort of people that want to hear good news for when anybody's well off they don't much mind about hearing news from distant parts but if a poor man or woman's in trouble and has hard work to make out a living they like to have a letter to tell em they've got a friend as will help em to be sure we can't help knowing something about god even if we've never heard the gospel the good news that our saviour brought us for we know everything comes from god don't you say almost every day this and that will happen please god and we shall begin to cut the grass soon please god to send us a little more sunshine we know very well we are altogether in the hands of god we didn't bring ourselves into the world we can't keep ourselves alive while we're sleeping the daylight and the wind and the corn and the cows to give us milk everything we have comes from god and he gave us our souls and put love between parents and children and husband and wife but is that as much as we want to know about god we see he is great and mighty and can do what he will we are lost as if we was struggling in great waters when we try to think of him but perhaps doubts come into your mind like this can god take much notice of us poor people perhaps he only made the world for the great and the wise and the rich it doesn't cost him much to give us our little handful of victual and bit of clothing but how do we know he cares for us any more than we care for the worms and things in the garden so as we rear our carrots and onions will god take care of us when we die and has he any comfort for us when we are lame and sick and helpless perhaps too he is angry with us else why does the blight come and the bad harvests and the fever and all sorts of pain and trouble for our life is full of trouble and if god sends us good he seems to send bad too how is it how is it ah dear friends we are in sad want of good news about god and what does other good news signify if we haven't that for everything else comes to an end and when we die we leave it all but god lasts when everything else is gone what shall we do if he is not our friend then dinah told how the good news had been brought and how the mind of god towards the poor had been made manifest in the life of jesus dwelling on its lowliness and its acts of mercy so you see dear friends she went on jesus spent his time almost all in doing good to poor people he preached out of doors to them and he made friends of poor workmen and taught them and took pains with them not but what he did good to the rich too for he was full of love to all men only he saw as the poor were more in want of his help so he cured the lame and the sick and the blind and he worked miracles to feed the hungry because he said he was sorry for them and he was very kind to the little children and comforted those who had lost their friends and he spoke very tenderly to poor sinners that were sorry for their sins ah wouldn't you love such a man if you saw him if he were here in this village what a kind heart he must have what a friend he would be to go to in trouble how pleasant it must be to be taught by him well dear friends who was this man was he only a good man a very good man and no more like our dear mr wesley who has been taken from us he was the son of god in the image of the father the bible says that means just like god who is the beginning and end of all things the god we want to know about so then all the love that jesus showed to the poor is the same love that god has for us we can understand what jesus felt because he came in a body like ours and spoke words such as we speak to each other we were afraid to think what god was before the god who made the world and the sky and the thunder and lightning we could never see him we could only see the things he had made and some of these things was very terrible so as we might well tremble when we thought of him but our blessed saviour has showed us what god is in a way us poor ignorant people can understand he has showed us what god's heart is what are his feelings towards us but let us see a little more about what jesus came on earth for another time he said i came to seek and to save that which was lost and another time i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance the lost sinners ah dear friends does that mean you and me hitherto the traveller had been chained to the spot against his will by the charm of dinah's mellow treble tones which had a variety of modulation like that of a fine instrument touched with the unconscious skill of musical instinct the simple things she said seemed like novelties as a melody strikes us with a new feeling when we hear it sung by the pure voice of a boyish chorister the quiet depth of conviction with which she spoke seemed in itself an evidence for the truth of her message he saw that she had thoroughly arrested her hearers the villagers had pressed nearer to her and there was no longer anything but grave attention on all faces she spoke slowly though quite fluently often pausing after a question or before any transition of ideas there was no change of attitude no gesture the effect of her speech was produced entirely by the inflections of her voice and when she came to the question will god take care of us when we die she uttered it in such a tone of plaintive appeal that the tears came into some of the hardest eyes the stranger had ceased to doubt as he had done at the first glance that she could fix the attention of her rougher hearers but still he wondered whether she could have that power of rousing their more violent emotions which must surely be a necessary seal of her vocation as a methodist preacher until she came to the words lost sinners when there was a great change in her voice and manner she had made a long pause before the exclamation and the pause seemed to be filled by agitating thoughts that showed themselves in her features her pale face became paler the circles under her eyes deepened as they did when tears half gather without falling and the mild loving eyes took an expression of appalled pity as if she had suddenly discerned a destroying angel hovering over the heads of the people her voice became deep and muffled but there was still no gesture nothing could be less like the ordinary type of the ranter than dinah she was not preaching as she heard others preach but speaking directly from her own emotions and under the inspiration of her own simple faith but now she had entered into a new current of feeling her manner became less calm her utterance more rapid and agitated as she tried to bring home to the people their guilt their wilful darkness their state of disobedience to god as she dwelt on the hatefulness of sin the divine holiness and the sufferings of the saviour by which a way had been opened for their salvation at last it seemed as if in her yearning desire to reclaim the lost sheep she could not be satisfied by addressing her hearers as a body she appealed first to one and then to another beseeching them with tears to turn to god while there was yet time painting to them the desolation of their souls lost in sin feeding on the husks of this miserable world far away from god their father and then the love of the saviour who was waiting and watching for their return there was many a responsive sigh and groan from her fellow methodists but the village mind does not easily take fire and a little smouldering vague anxiety that might easily die out again was the utmost effect dinah's preaching had wrought in them at present yet no one had retired except the children and old feyther taft who being too deaf to catch many words had some time ago gone back to his inglenook wiry ben was feeling very uncomfortable and almost wishing he had not come to hear dinah he thought what she said would haunt him somehow yet he couldn't help liking to look at her and listen to her though he dreaded every moment that she would fix her eyes on him and address him in particular she had already addressed sandy jim who was now holding the baby to relieve his wife and the big soft hearted man had rubbed away some tears with his fist with a confused intention of being a better fellow going less to the holly bush down by the stone pits and cleaning himself more regularly of a sunday in front of sandy jim stood chad's bess who had shown an unwonted quietude and fixity of attention ever since dinah had begun to speak not that the matter of the discourse had arrested her at once for she was lost in a puzzling speculation as to what pleasure and satisfaction there could be in life to a young woman who wore a cap like dinah's giving up this inquiry in despair she took to studying dinah's nose eyes mouth and hair and wondering whether it was better to have such a sort of pale face as that or fat red cheeks and round black eyes like her own but gradually the influence of the general gravity told upon her and she became conscious of what dinah was saying the gentle tones the loving persuasion did not touch her but when the more severe appeals came she began to be frightened poor bessy had always been considered a naughty girl she was conscious of it if it was necessary to be very good it was clear she must be in a bad way she couldn't find her places at church as sally rann could she had often been tittering when she curcheyed to mr irwine and these religious deficiencies were accompanied by a corresponding slackness in the minor morals for bessy belonged unquestionably to that unsoaped lazy class of feminine characters with whom you may venture to eat an egg an apple or a nut all this she was generally conscious of and hitherto"
