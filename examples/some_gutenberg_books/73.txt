"1" "the tall one's companions cried with emphasis that they too had evolved the same thing and they congratulated themselves upon it but there were others who said that the tall one's plan was not the true one at all they persisted with other theories there was a vigorous discussion the youth took no part in them as he walked along in careless line he was engaged with his own eternal debate he could not hinder himself from dwelling upon it he was despondent and sullen and threw shifting glances about him he looked ahead often expecting to hear from the advance the rattle of firing but the long serpents crawled slowly from hill to hill without bluster of smoke a dun colored cloud of dust floated away to the right the sky overhead was of a fairy blue the youth studied the faces of his companions ever on the watch to detect kindred emotions he suffered disappointment some ardor of the air which was causing the veteran commands to move with glee almost with song had infected the new regiment the men began to speak of victory as of a thing they knew also the tall soldier received his vindication they were certainly going to come around in behind the enemy they expressed commiseration for that part of the army which had been left upon the river bank felicitating themselves upon being a part of a blasting host the youth considering himself as separated from the others was saddened by the blithe and merry speeches that went from rank to rank the company wags all made their best endeavors the regiment tramped to the tune of laughter the blatant soldier often convulsed whole files by his biting sarcasms aimed at the tall one and it was not long before all the men seemed to forget their mission whole brigades grinned in unison and regiments laughed a rather fat soldier attempted to pilfer a horse from a dooryard he planned to load his knapsack upon it he was escaping with his prize when a young girl rushed from the house and grabbed the animal's mane there followed a wrangle the young girl with pink cheeks and shining eyes stood like a dauntless statue the observant regiment standing at rest in the roadway whooped at once and entered whole souled upon the side of the maiden the men became so engrossed in this affair that they entirely ceased to remember their own large war they jeered the piratical private and called attention to various defects in his personal appearance and they were wildly enthusiastic in support of the young girl to her from some distance came bold advice hit him with a stick there were crows and catcalls showered upon him when he retreated without the horse the regiment rejoiced at his downfall loud and vociferous congratulations were showered upon the maiden who stood panting and regarding the troops with defiance at nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces and the fragments went into the fields to camp tents sprang up like strange plants camp fires like red peculiar blossoms dotted the night the youth kept from intercourse with his companions as much as circumstances would allow him in the evening he wandered a few paces into the gloom from this little distance the many fires with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays made weird and satanic effects he lay down in the grass the blades pressed tenderly against his cheek the moon had been lighted and was hung in a treetop the liquid stillness of the night enveloping him made him feel vast pity for himself there was a caress in the soft winds and the whole mood of the darkness he thought was one of sympathy for himself in his distress he wished without reserve that he was at home again making the endless rounds from the house to the barn from the barn to the fields from the fields to the barn from the barn to the house he remembered he had so often cursed the brindle cow and her mates and had sometimes flung milking stools but from his present point of view there was a halo of happiness about each of their heads and he would have sacrificed all the brass buttons on the continent to have been enabled to return to them he told himself that he was not formed for a soldier and he mused seriously upon the radical differences between himself and those men who were dodging implike around the fires as he mused thus he heard the rustle of grass and upon turning his head discovered the loud soldier he called out oh wilson the latter approached and looked down why hello henry is it you what are you doing here oh thinking said the youth the other sat down and carefully lighted his pipe you're getting blue my boy you're looking thundering peek ed what the dickens is wrong with you oh nothing said the youth the loud soldier launched then into the subject of the anticipated fight oh we've got em now as he spoke his boyish face was wreathed in a gleeful smile and his voice had an exultant ring we've got em now at last by the eternal thunders we'll like em good if the truth was known he added more soberly they've licked _us_ about every clip up to now but this time this time we'll lick em good i thought you was objecting to this march a little while ago said the youth coldly oh it wasn't that explained the other i don't mind marching if there's going to be fighting at the end of it what i hate is this getting moved here and moved there with no good coming of it as far as i can see excepting sore feet and damned short rations well jim conklin says we'll get plenty of fighting this time he's right for once i guess though i can't see how it come this time we're in for a big battle and we've got the best end of it certain sure gee rod how we will thump em he arose and began to pace to and fro excitedly the thrill of his enthusiasm made him walk with an elastic step he was sprightly vigorous fiery in his belief in success he looked into the future with clear proud eye and he swore with the air of an old soldier the youth watched him for a moment in silence when he finally spoke his voice was as bitter as dregs oh you're going to do great things i s'pose the loud soldier blew a thoughtful cloud of smoke from his pipe oh i don't know he remarked with dignity i don't know i s'pose i'll do as well as the rest i'm going to try like thunder he evidently complimented himself upon the modesty of this statement how do you know you won't run when the time comes asked the youth run said the loud one run of course not he laughed well continued the youth lots of good a nough men have thought they was going to do great things before the fight but when the time come they skedaddled oh that's all true i s'pose replied the other but i'm not going to skedaddle the man that bets on my running will lose his money that's all he nodded confidently oh shucks said the youth you ain't the bravest man in the world are you no i ain't exclaimed the loud soldier indignantly and i didn't say i was the bravest man in the world neither i said i was going to do my share of fighting that's what i said and i am too who are you anyhow you talk as if you thought you was napoleon bonaparte he glared at the youth for a moment and then strode away the youth called in a savage voice after his comrade well you needn't git mad about it but the other continued on his way and made no reply he felt alone in space when his injured comrade had disappeared his failure to discover any mite of resemblance in their viewpoints made him more miserable than before no one seemed to be wrestling with such a terrific personal problem he was a mental outcast he went slowly to his tent and stretched himself on a blanket by the side of the snoring tall soldier in the darkness he saw visions of a thousand tongued fear that would babble at his back and cause him to flee while others were going coolly about their country's business he admitted that he would not be able to cope with this monster he felt that every nerve in his body would be an ear to hear the voices while other men would remain stolid and deaf and as he sweated with the pain of these thoughts he could hear low serene sentences i'll bid five make it six seven seven goes he stared at the red shivering reflection of a fire on the white wall of his tent until exhausted and ill from the monotony of his suffering he fell asleep chapter 3 when another night came the columns changed to purple streaks filed across two pontoon bridges a glaring fire wine tinted the waters of the river its rays shining upon the moving masses of troops brought forth here and there sudden gleams of silver or gold upon the other shore a dark and mysterious range of hills was curved against the sky the insect voices of the night sang solemnly after this crossing the youth assured himself that at any moment they might be suddenly and fearfully assaulted from the caves of the lowering woods he kept his eyes watchfully upon the darkness but his regiment went unmolested to a camping place and its soldiers slept the brave sleep of wearied men in the morning they were routed out with early energy and hustled along a narrow road that led deep into the forest it was during this rapid march that the regiment lost many of the marks of a new command the men had begun to count the miles upon their fingers and they grew tired sore feet an damned short rations that's all said the loud soldier there was perspiration and grumblings after a time they began to shed their knapsacks some tossed them unconcernedly down others hid them carefully asserting their plans to return for them at some convenient time men extricated themselves from thick shirts presently few carried anything but their necessary clothing blankets haversacks canteens and arms and ammunition you can now eat and shoot said the tall soldier to the youth that's all you want to do there was sudden change from the ponderous infantry of theory to the light and speedy infantry of practice the regiment relieved of a burden received a new impetus but there was much loss of valuable knapsacks and on the whole very good shirts but the regiment was not yet veteranlike in appearance veteran regiments in the army were likely to be very small aggregations of men once when the command had first come to the field some perambulating veterans noting the length of their column had accosted them thus hey fellers what brigade is that and when the men had replied that they formed a regiment and not a brigade the older soldiers had laughed and said o gawd also there was too great a similarity in the hats the hats of a regiment should properly represent the history of headgear for a period of years and moreover there were no letters of faded gold speaking from the colors they were new and beautiful and the color bearer habitually oiled the pole presently the army again sat down to think the odor of the peaceful pines was in the men's nostrils the sound of monotonous axe blows rang through the forest and the insects nodding upon their perches crooned like old women the youth returned to his theory of a blue demonstration one gray dawn however he was kicked in the leg by the tall soldier and then before he was entirely awake he found himself running down a wood road in the midst of men who were panting from the first effects of speed his canteen banged rythmically upon his thigh and his haversack bobbed softly his musket bounced a trifle from his shoulder at each stride and made his cap feel uncertain upon his head he could hear the men whisper jerky sentences say what's all this about what th thunder we skedaddlin this way fer billie keep off m feet yeh run like a cow and the loud soldier's shrill voice could be heard what th'devil they in sich a hurry for the youth thought the damp fog of early morning moved from the rush of a great body of troops from the distance came a sudden spatter of firing he was bewildered as he ran with his comrades he strenuously tried to think but all he knew was that if he fell down those coming behind would tread upon him all his faculties seemed to be needed to guide him over and past obstructions he felt carried along by a mob the sun spread disclosing rays and one by one regiments burst into view like armed men just born of the earth the youth perceived that the time had come he was about to be measured for a moment he felt in the face of his great trial like a babe and the flesh over his heart seemed very thin he seized time to look about him calculatingly but he instantly saw that it would be impossible for him to escape from the regiment it inclosed him and there were iron laws of tradition and law on four sides he was in a moving box as he perceived this fact it occurred to him that he had never wished to come to the war he had not enlisted of his free will he had been dragged by the merciless government and now they were taking him out to be slaughtered the regiment slid down a bank and wallowed across a little stream the mournful current moved slowly on and from the water shaded black some white bubble eyes looked at the men as they climbed the hill on the farther side artillery began to boom here the youth forgot many things as he felt a sudden impulse of curiosity he scrambled up the bank with a speed that could not be exceeded by a bloodthirsty man he expected a battle scene there were some little fields girted and squeezed by a forest spread over the grass and in among the tree trunks he could see knots and waving lines of skirmishers who were running hither and thither and firing at the landscape a dark battle line lay upon a sunstruck clearing that gleamed orange color a flag fluttered other regiments floundered up the bank the brigade was formed in line of battle and after a pause started slowly through the woods in the rear of the receding skirmishers who were continually melting into the scene to appear again farther on they were always busy as bees deeply absorbed in their little combats the youth tried to observe everything he did not use care to avoid trees and branches and his forgotten feet were constantly knocking against stones or getting entangled in briers he was aware that these battalions with their commotions were woven red and startling into the gentle fabric of softened greens and browns it looked to be a wrong place for a battle field the skirmishers in advance fascinated him their shots into thickets and at distant and prominent trees spoke to him of tragedies hidden mysterious solemn once the line encountered the body of a dead soldier he lay upon his back staring at the sky he was dressed in an awkward suit of yellowish brown the youth could see that the soles of his shoes had been worn to the thinness of writing paper and from a great rent in one the dead foot projected piteously and it was as if fate had betrayed the soldier in death it exposed to his enemies that poverty which in life he had perhaps concealed from his friends the ranks opened covertly to avoid the corpse the invulnerable dead man forced a way for himself the youth looked keenly at the ashen face the wind raised the tawny beard it moved as if a hand were stroking it he vaguely desired to walk around and around the body and stare the impulse of the living to try to read in dead eyes the answer to the question during the march the ardor which the youth had acquired when out of view of the field rapidly faded to nothing his curiosity was quite easily satisfied if an intense scene had caught him with its wild swing as he came to the top of the bank he might have gone gone roaring on this advance upon nature was too calm he had opportunity to reflect he had time in which to wonder about himself and to attempt to probe his sensations absurd ideas took hold upon him he thought that he did not relish the landscape it threatened him a coldness swept over his back and it is true that his trousers felt to him that they were no fit for his legs at all a house standing placidly in distant fields had to him an ominous look the shadows of the woods were formidable he was certain that in this vista there lurked fierce eyed hosts the swift thought came to him that the generals did not know what they were about it was all a trap suddenly those close forests would bristle with rifle barrels ironlike brigades would appear in the rear they were all going to be sacrificed the generals were stupids the enemy would presently swallow the whole command he glared about him expecting to see the stealthy approach of his death he thought that he must break from the ranks and harangue his comrades they must not all be killed like pigs and he was sure it would come to pass unless they were informed of these dangers the generals were idiots to send them marching into a regular pen there was but one pair of eyes in the corps he would step forth and make a speech shrill and passionate words came to his lips the line broken into moving fragments by the ground went calmly on through fields and woods the youth looked at the men nearest him and saw for the most part expressions of deep interest as if they were investigating something that had fascinated them one or two stepped with overvaliant airs as if they were already plunged into war others walked as upon thin ice the greater part of the untested men appeared quiet and absorbed they were going to look at war the red animal war the blood swollen god and they were deeply engrossed in this march as he looked the youth gripped his outcry at his throat he saw that even if the men were tottering with fear they would laugh at his warning they would jeer him and if practicable pelt him with missiles admitting that he might be wrong a frenzied declamation of the kind would turn him into a worm he assumed then the demeanor of one who knows that he is doomed alone to unwritten responsibilities he lagged with tragic glances at the sky he was surprised presently by the young lieutenant of his company who began heartily to beat him with a sword calling out in a loud and insolent voice come young man get up into ranks there no skulking ll do here he mended his pace with suitable haste and he hated the lieutenant who had no appreciation of fine minds he was a mere brute after a time the brigade was halted in the cathedral light of a forest the busy skirmishers were still popping through the aisles of the wood could be seen the floating smoke from their rifles sometimes it went up in little balls white and compact during this halt many men in the regiment began erecting tiny hills in front of them they used stones sticks earth and anything they thought might turn a bullet some built comparatively large ones while others seems content with little ones this procedure caused a discussion among the men some wished to fight like duelists believing it to be correct to stand erect and be from their feet to their foreheads a mark they said they scorned the devices of the cautious but the others scoffed in reply and pointed to the veterans on the flanks who were digging at the ground like terriers in a short time there was quite a barricade along the regimental fronts directly however they were ordered to withdraw from that place this astounded the youth he forgot his stewing over the advance movement well then what did they march us out here for he demanded of the tall soldier the latter with calm faith began a heavy explanation although he had been compelled to leave a little protection of stones and dirt to which he had devoted much care and skill when the regiment was aligned in another position each man's regard for his safety caused another line of small intrenchments they ate their noon meal behind a third one they were moved from this one also they were marched from place to place with apparent aimlessness the youth had been taught that a man became another thing in battle he saw his salvation in such a change hence this waiting was an ordeal to him he was in a fever of impatience he considered that there was denoted a lack of purpose on the part of the generals he began to complain to the tall soldier i can't stand this much longer he cried i don't see what good it does to make us wear out our legs for nothin he wished to return to camp knowing that this affair was a blue demonstration or else to go into a battle and discover that he had been a fool in his doubts and was in truth a man of traditional courage the strain of present circumstances he felt to be intolerable the philosophical tall soldier measured a sandwich of cracker and pork and swallowed it in a nonchalant manner oh i suppose we must go reconnoitering around the country jest to keep em from getting too close or to develop em or something huh said the loud soldier well cried the youth still fidgeting i'd rather do anything most than go tramping round the country all day doing no good to nobody and jest tiring ourselves out so would i said the loud soldier it ain't right i tell you if anybody with any sense was a runnin this army it oh shut up roared the tall private you little fool you little damn cuss you ain't had that there coat and them pants on for six months and yet you talk as if well i wanta do some fighting anyway interrupted the other i didn't come here to walk i could ave walked to home round an round the barn if i jest wanted to walk the tall one red faced swallowed another sandwich as if taking poison in despair but gradually as he chewed his face became again quiet and contented he could not rage in fierce argument in the presence of such sandwiches during his meals he always wore an air of blissful contemplation of the food he had swallowed his spirit seemed then to be communing with the viands he accepted new environment and circumstance with great coolness eating from his haversack at every opportunity on the march he went along with the stride of a hunter objecting to neither gait nor distance and he had not raised his voice when he had been ordered away from three little protective piles of earth and stone each of which had been an engineering feat worthy of being made sacred to the name of his grandmother in the afternoon the regiment went out over the same ground it had taken in the morning the landscape then ceased to threaten the youth he had been close to it and become familiar with it when however they began to pass into a new region his old fears of stupidity and incompetence reassailed him but this time he doggedly let them babble he was occupied with his problem and in his desperation he concluded that the stupidity did not greatly matter once he thought he had concluded that it would be better to get killed directly and end his troubles regarding death thus out of the corner of his eye he conceived it to be nothing but rest and he was filled with a momentary astonishment that he should have made an extraordinary commotion over the mere matter of getting killed he would die he would go to some place where he would be understood it was useless to expect appreciation of his profound and fine sense from such men as the lieutenant he must look to the grave for comprehension the skirmish fire increased to a long clattering sound with it was mingled far away cheering a battery spoke directly the youth could see the skirmishers running they were pursued by the sound of musketry fire after a time the hot dangerous flashes of the rifles were visible smoke clouds went slowly and insolently across the fields like observant phantoms the din became crescendo like the roar of an oncoming train a brigade ahead of them and on the right went into action with a rending roar it was as if it had exploded and thereafter it lay stretched in the distance behind a long gray wall that one was obliged to look twice at to make sure that it was smoke the youth forgetting his neat plan of getting killed gazed spell bound his eyes grew wide and busy with the action of the scene his mouth was a little ways open of a sudden he felt a heavy and sad hand laid upon his shoulder awakening from his trance of observation he turned and beheld the loud soldier it's my first and last battle old boy said the latter with intense gloom he was quite pale and his girlish lip was trembling eh murmured the youth in great astonishment it's my first and last battle old boy continued the loud soldier something tells me what i'm a gone coon this first time and and i w want you to take these here things to my folks he ended in a quavering sob of pity for himself he handed the youth a little packet done up in a yellow envelope why what the devil began the youth again but the other gave him a glance as from the depths of a tomb and raised his limp hand in a prophetic manner and turned away chapter 4 the brigade was halted in the fringe of a grove the men crouched among the trees and pointed their restless guns out at the fields they tried to look beyond the smoke out of this haze they could see running men some shouted information and gestured as the hurried the men of the new regiment watched and listened eagerly while their tongues ran on in gossip of the battle they mouthed rumors that had flown like birds out of the unknown they say perry has been driven in with big loss yes carrott went t th hospital he said he was sick that smart lieutenant is commanding g company th boys say they won't be under carrott no more if they all have t desert they allus knew he was a hannises batt'ry is took it ain't either i saw hannises batt'ry off on th left not more'n

of th fight three fingers was crunched th dern doctor wanted t amputate m an bill he raised a heluva row i hear he's a funny feller the din in front swelled to a tremendous chorus the youth and his fellows were frozen to silence they could see a flag that tossed in the smoke angrily near it were the blurred and agitated forms of troops there"
