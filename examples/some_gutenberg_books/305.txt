not m de chalusse's daughter you may therefore tell me the truth is his condition hopeless alarming yes hopeless no but monsieur this terrible unconsciousness it usually follows such an attack as he has been the victim of still we may hope that the paralysis will gradually disappear and the power of motion return after a time mademoiselle marguerite was listening pale agitated and embarrassed it was evident that she had a question on her lips which she scarcely dared to ask at last however summoning all her courage she exclaimed and if m de chalusse should not recover will he die without regaining consciousness without being able to speak i am unable to say mademoiselle the count's malady is one of those which set at naught all the hypotheses of science she thanked him sadly sent a servant to summon madame leon and returned to the count's room as for the doctor he said to himself as he went downstairs what a strange girl is she afraid that the count will regain consciousness or on the contrary does she wish him to speak is there any question of a will under all this what else can it be what is at stake his preoccupation was so intense that he almost forgot where he was going and he paused on every step it was not until the fresh air of the courtyard blew upon his face reminding him of the realities of life that the charlatanesque element in his nature regained the ascendency my friend he said addressing m casimir who was lighting him out you must at once have some straw spread over the street so as to deaden the sound of the vehicles and to morrow you must inform the commissary of police ten minutes later a thick bed of straw had been strewed across the thoroughfare and the drivers of passing vehicles involuntarily slackened their speed for every one in paris knows what this signifies m casimir personally superintended the work which was intrusted to the grooms and he was about to return indoors again when a young man who had been walking up and down in front of the mansion for more than an hour hastily approached him he was a beardless fellow with a strangely wrinkled face as leaden tinted as that of a confirmed absinthe drinker his general expression was shrewd and at the same time impudent and surprising audacity gleamed in his eyes what do you want asked m casimir the young fellow bowed humbly and replied ah don't you recognize me monsieur i'm toto excuse me victor chupin employed by m isidore fortunat oh yes i recollect i came in obedience to my employer's orders to inquire if you had obtained the information you promised him but seeing that something had happened at your house i didn't dare go in but decided to watch for you and you did quite right my lad i have no information to give you ah yes stop the marquis de valorsay was closeted with the count for two hours yesterday but what good will that do the count has been taken suddenly ill and he will scarcely live through the night victor chupin was thunderstruck impossible he cried is it for him that the straw has been strewed in the street it's for him what a lucky fellow no one would go to such expense for me but i have an idea that my guv'nor will hardly laugh when i tell him this still thank you all the same m'sieur and au revoir he was darting off when a sudden thought detained him excuse me said he with conjuror like volubility i was so horrified that i forgot business tell me m'sieur if the count dies you'll take charge of the funeral arrangements won't you very well a word of advice then don't go to the regular undertakers but come to me here's my address proffering a card i will treat with the undertakers for you and take charge of everything it will be much better and far cheaper for you on account of certain arrangements i've made with these parties everything to the very last plume is warranted to give perfect satisfaction each item will be specified in the bill and can be verified during the ceremony no payment exacted until after delivery well is it understood the valet shrugged his shoulders nonsense said he carelessly what is all that to me ah i forgot to mention that there would be a commission of two hundred francs to divide between us that's consideration give me your card and rely on me my compliments to m fortunat please and so saying he re entered the house victor chupin drew a huge silver watch from his pocket and consulted it five minutes to eight he growled and the guv'nor expects me at eight precisely i shall have to stretch out my legs ii m isidore fortunat resided at no 27 place de la bourse on the third floor he had a handsome suite of apartments a drawing room a dining room a bed room a large outer office where his clerks worked and a private one which was the sanctuary of his thoughts and meditations the whole cost him only six thousand francs a year a mere trifle as rents go nowadays his lease entitled him moreover to the use of a room ten feet square up under the eaves where he lodged his servant madame dodelin a woman of forty six or thereabouts who had met with reverses of fortune and who now took such good charge of his establishment that his table for he ate at home was truly fit for a sybarite having been established here for five years or more m fortunat was very well known in the neighborhood and as he paid his rent promptly and met all his obligations without demur he was generally respected besides people knew very well from what source m fortunat derived his income he gave his attention to contested claims liquidations the recovery of legacies and so on as was shown by the inscription in large letters which figured on the elegant brass plate adorning his door he must have had a prosperous business for he employed six collectors in addition to the clerks who wrote all day long in his office and his clients were so numerous that the concierge was often heard to complain of the way they ran up and down the stairs declaring that it was worse than a procession to be just we must add that m fortunat's appearance manners and conduct were of a nature to quiet all suspicions he was some thirty eight years of age extremely methodical in his habits gentle and refined in his manner intelligent very good looking and always dressed in perfect taste he was accused of being in business matters as cold as polished and as hard as one of the marble slabs of the morgue but then no one was obliged to employ him unless they chose to do so this much is certain he did not frequent cafes or places of amusement if he went out at all after dinner it was only to pass the evening at the house of some rich client in the neighborhood he detested the smell of tobacco and was inclined to be devout never failing to attend eight o'clock mass on sunday mornings his housekeeper suspected him of matrimonial designs and perhaps she was right on the evening that the count de chalusse was struck with apoplexy m isidore fortunat had been dining alone and was sipping a cup of tea when the door bell rang announcing the arrival of a visitor madame dodelin hastened to open the door and in walked victor chupin breathless from his hurried walk it had not taken him twenty five minutes to cover the distance which separates the rue de courcelles from the place de la bourse you are late victor said m fortunat quietly that's true monsieur but it isn't my fault everything was in confusion down there and i was obliged to wait how is that why the count de chalusse was stricken with apoplexy this evening and he is probably dead by this time m fortunat sprang from his chair with a livid face and trembling lips stricken with apoplexy he exclaimed in a husky voice i am ruined then fearing madame dodelin's curiosity he seized the lamp and rushed into his office crying to chupin follow me chupin obeyed without a word for he was a shrewd fellow and knew how to make the best of a trying situation he was not usually allowed to enter this private room the floor of which was covered with a magnificent carpet and so after carefully closing the door he remained standing hat in hand and looking somewhat intimidated but m fortunat seemed to have forgotten his presence after depositing the lamp on the mantel shelf he walked several times round and round the room like a hunted beast seeking for some means of egress if the count is dead he muttered the marquis de valorsay is lost farewell to the millions the blow was so cruel and so entirely unexpected that he could not would not believe in its reality he walked straight to chupin and caught him by the collar as if the young fellow had been the cause of this misfortune it isn't possible said he the count cannot be dead you are deceiving me or they deceived you you must have misunderstood you only wished to give some excuse for your delay perhaps speak say something as a rule chupin was not easily impressed but he felt almost frightened by his employer's agitation i only repeated what m casimir told me monsieur was his reply he then wished to furnish some particulars but m fortunat had already resumed his furious tramp to and fro giving vent to his wrath and despair in incoherent exclamations forty thousand francs lost he exclaimed forty thousand francs counted out there on my desk i see them yet counted and placed in the hand of the marquis de valorsay in exchange for his signature my savings for a number of years and i have only a worthless scrap of paper to show for them that cursed marquis and he was to come here this evening and i was to give him ten thousand francs more they are lying there in that drawer let him come the wretch let him come anger had positively brought foam to m fortunat's lips and any one seeing him then would subsequently have had but little confidence in his customary good natured air and unctuous politeness and yet the marquis is as much to be pitied as i am he continued he loses as much even more and such a sure thing it seemed too what speculation can a fellow engage in after this and a man must put his money somewhere he can't bury it in the ground chupin listened with an air of profound commiseration but it was only assumed he was inwardly jubilant for his interest in the affair was in direct opposition to that of his employer indeed if m fortunat lost forty thousand francs by the count de chalusse's death chupin expected to make a hundred francs commission on the funeral still he may have made a will pursued m fortunat but no i'm sure he hasn't a poor devil who has only a few sous to leave behind him always takes this precaution he thinks he may be run over by an omnibus and suddenly killed and he always writes and signs his last wishes but millionaires don't think of such things they believe themselves immortal he paused to reflect for a moment for power of reflection had returned to him his excitement had quickly spent itself by reason of its very violence this much is certain he resumed slowly and in a more composed voice whether the count has made a will or not valorsay will lose the millions he expected from chalusse if there is no will mademoiselle marguerite won't have a sou and then good evening if there is one this devil of a girl suddenly becoming her own mistress and wealthy into the bargain will send monsieur de valorsay about his business especially if she loves another as he himself admits and in that case again good evening m fortunat drew out his handkerchief and pausing in front of the looking glass wiped the perspiration from his brow and arranged his disordered hair he was one of those men who may be stunned but never crushed by a catastrophe in conclusion he muttered i must enter my forty thousand francs as an item in the profit and loss account it only remains to be seen if it would not be possible to regain them in the same affair he was again master of himself and never had his mind been more clear he seated himself at his desk leant his elbows upon it rested his head on his hands and remained for some time perfectly motionless but there was triumph in his gesture when he at last looked up again i am safe he muttered so low that chupin could not hear him what a fool i was if there is no will a fourth of the millions shall be mine ah when a man knows his ground he never need lose the battle but i must act quickly he added very quickly and so speaking he rose and glanced at the clock nine o'clock said he i must open the campaign this very evening motionless in his dark corner chupin still retained his commiserating attitude but he was so oppressed with curiosity that he could scarcely breathe he opened his eyes and ears to the utmost and watched his employer's slightest movements with intense interest prompt to act when he had once decided upon his course m fortunat now drew from his desk a large portfolio crammed full of letters receipts bills deeds of property and old parchments i can certainly discover the necessary pretext here he murmured rummaging through the mass of papers but he did not at once find what he sought and he was growing impatient as could be seen by his feverish haste when all at once he paused with a sigh of relief at last he held in his hand a soiled and crumpled note of hand affixed by a pin to a huissier's protest thus proving conclusively that it had been dishonored m fortunat waved these strips of paper triumphantly and with a satisfied air exclaimed it is here that i must strike it is here if casimir hasn't deceived me that i shall find the indispensable information i need he was in such haste that he did not wait to put his portfolio in order he threw it with the papers it had contained into the drawer of his desk again and approaching chupin he asked it was you was it not victor who obtained that information respecting the solvency of the vantrassons husband and wife who let out furnished rooms yes monsieur and i gave you the answer nothing to hope for i know but that doesn't matter do you remember their address perfectly they are now living on the asnieres road beyond the fortifications on the right hand side what is the number chupin hesitated reflected for a moment and then began to scratch his head furiously as he was in the habit of doing whenever his memory failed him and he wished to recall it to duty i'm not sure whether the number is eighteen or forty six he said at last that is never mind interrupted m fortunat if i sent you to the house could you find it oh yes m'sieur at once with my eyes shut i can see the place perfectly a rickety old barrack there is a tract of unoccupied land on one side and a kitchen garden in the rear very well you shall accompany me there chupin seemed astonished by this strange proposal what m'sieur said he do you think of going there at this time of night why not shall we find the establishment closed no certainly not vantrasson doesn't merely keep furnished rooms he's a grocer and sells liquor too his place is open until eleven o'clock at least but if you are going there to present a bill it's perhaps a little late if i were in your place m'sieur i should wait till to morrow it's raining and the streets are deserted it's an out of the way place too and in such cases a man has been known to settle his account with whatever came handiest with a cudgel or a bullet for instance are you afraid this question seemed so utterly absurd to chupin that he was not in the least offended by it his only answer was a disdainful shrug of the shoulders then we will go remarked m fortunat while i'm getting ready go and hire a cab and see that you get a good horse chupin was off in an instant tearing down the staircase like a tempest there was a cab stand only a few steps from the house but he preferred to run to the jobmaster's stables in the rue feydeau cab sir shouted several men as they saw him approaching he made no reply but began to examine the horses with the air of a connoisseur until at last he found an animal that suited him thereupon he beckoned to the driver and going to the little office where a woman sat reading my five sous if you please he said authoritatively the woman looked at him most jobmasters are in the habit of giving five sous to any servant who comes in search of a cab for his master and this was the custom here but the keeper of the office who felt sure that chupin was not a servant hesitated and this made the young fellow angry make haste he cried imperiously if you don't i shall run to the nearest stand the woman at once threw him five sous which he pocketed with a satisfied grin they were his rightfully his since he had taken the trouble to gain them he then hastily returned to the office to inform his employer that the cab was waiting at the door and found himself face to face with a sight which made him open his eyes to their widest extent m fortunat had profited by his clerk's absence not to disguise himself that would be saying too much but to make some changes in his appearance he had arrayed himself in a long overcoat shiny with grease and wear and falling below his knees in place of his elegant satin cravat he had knotted a gaudy silk neckerchief about his throat his boots were worn and out of shape and his hat would have been treated with contempt even by a dealer in old clothes of the prosperous fortunat so favorably known round about the place de la bourse naught remained save his face and his hands another fortunat had taken his place more than needy in aspect wretched famished gaunt with hunger ready for any desperate deed and yet he seemed at ease in this garb it yielded to his every movement as if he had worn it for a long time the butterfly had become a chrysalis again chupin's admiring smile must have repaid him for his trouble since the young clerk evinced approval m fortunat felt sure that vantrasson would take him for what he wished to appear a poor devil of an agent who was acting on some other person's behalf let us start at once said he but just as he was leaving the ante room he remembered an order of great importance which he wished to give he called madame dodelin and without paying the slightest heed to her astonishment at seeing him thus attired if the marquis de valorsay comes in my absence said he and he will come ask him to wait for me i shall return before midnight don't take him into my office he can wait in the drawing room this last order was certainly unnecessary since m fortunat had closed and double locked his office door and placed the key carefully in his own pocket but perhaps he had forgotten this circumstance there were now no traces of his recent anger and disappointment he was in excellent humor and you might have supposed that he was starting on an enterprise from which he expected to derive both pleasure and profit chupin was climbing to a place on the box beside the driver when his employer bade him take a seat inside the vehicle they were not long in reaching their destination for the horse was really a good one and the driver had been stimulated by the promise of a magnificent gratuity in fact m fortunat and his companion reached the asnieres road in less than forty minutes in obedience to the orders he had received before starting the cabman drew up on the right hand side of the road at about a hundred paces from the city gate beyond the fortifications well sir here you are are you satisfied he inquired as he opened the door perfectly satisfied replied m fortunat here is your promised gratuity now you have only to wait for us don't stir from this place do you understand but the driver shook his head excuse me he said but if it's all the same to you i will station myself over there near the gate here you see i should be afraid to go to sleep while over there very well suit yourself m fortunat replied this precaution on the driver's part convinced him that chupin had not exaggerated the evil reputation of this quarter of the parisian suburbs and indeed there was little of a reassuring character in the aspect of this broad road quite deserted at this hour and shrouded in the darkness of a tempestuous night the rain had ceased falling but the wind blew with increased violence twisting the branches off the trees tearing slates from the roofs and shaking the street lamps so furiously as to extinguish the gas they could not see a step before them the mud was ankle deep and not a person not a solitary soul was visible are we almost there m fortunat asked every ten paces almost there m'sieur chupin said this but to tell the truth he knew nothing about it he tried to discover where he was but did not succeed houses were becoming scanty and vacant plots of building ground more numerous it was only with the greatest difficulty that one could occasionally discern a light at last however after a quarter of an hour's hard struggling chupin uttered a joyful cry here we are m'sieur look said he a large building five stories high sinister of aspect and standing quite alone could just be distinguished in the darkness it was already falling to pieces and yet it was not entirely completed plainly enough the speculator who had undertaken the enterprise had not been rich enough to complete it on seeing the many closely pierced windows of the facade a passer by could not fail to divine for what purpose the building had been erected and in order that no one should remain in ignorance of it this inscription furnished rooms figured in letters three feet high between the third and fourth floors the inside arrangements could be easily divined innumerable rooms all small and inconvenient and let out at exorbitant rentals however victor chupin's memory had misled him this establishment was not on the right but on the left hand side of the road a perfect mire through which m fortunat and his companion were obliged to cross their eyes having become accustomed to the darkness they could discern sundry details as they approached the building the ground floor comprised two shops one of which was closed but the other was still open and a faint light gleamed through the soiled red curtains over the frontage appeared the shop keeper's name vantrasson while on either side in smaller letters were the words groceries and provisions foreign and french wines everything about this den denoted abject poverty and low debauchery m fortunat certainly did not recoil but before entering the shop he was not sorry to have an opportunity to reconnoitre he approached cautiously and peered through the window at a place where a rent in the curtain allowed him some view of the interior behind the counter a woman who looked some fifty years of age was seated mending a soiled dress by the light of a smoking lamp she was short and very stout she seemed literally weighed down and puffed out by an unwholesome and unnatural mass of superfluous flesh and she was as white as if her veins had been filled with water instead of blood her hanging cheeks her receding forehead and her thin lips imparted an alarming expression of wickedness and cunning to her countenance at the farther end of the store fortunat could vaguely discern the figure of a man seated on a stool he seemed to be asleep for his crossed arms rested on a table with his head leaning on them good luck whispered chupin in his employer's ear there is not a customer in the place vantrasson and his wife are alone this circumstance was by no means displeasing to m fortunat as could be seen by his expression of face so m'sieur continued chupin you need have no fears i'll remain here and watch while you go in m fortunat did so on hearing the door open and shut the woman laid down her work what can i do for monsieur she asked in a wheedling voice m fortunat did not reply at once but he drew the note with which he had provided himself from his pocket and displayed it i am a huissier's clerk he then exclaimed and i called in reference to this little matter a note of hand for five hundred and eighty three francs value received in goods signed vantrasson and made payable to the order of a person named barutin an execution said the woman whose voice suddenly soured vantrasson wake up and come and see about this this summons was unnecessary on hearing the words note of hand the man had lifted his head and at the name of barutin he rose and approached with a heavy uncertain step as if he had not yet slept off his intoxication he was younger than his wife tall with a well proportioned and athletic form his features were regular but the abuse of alcohol and all sorts of excesses had greatly marred them and their present expression was one of ferocious brutishness what's that you are talking about he asked in a harsh grating voice is it to mock people that you come and ask for money on the 15th of october rent day where have you seen any money left after the landlord has made his round besides what is this bill give it me to look at m fortunat was not guilty of such folly he did not intrust the paper to vantrasson's hand but held it a little distance from him and then read it aloud when he had finished that note fell due eighteen months ago declared vantrasson it is worth nothing now you are mistaken a note of this kind is of value any time within five years after the day it goes to protest possibly but as barutin has failed and gone no one knows where i am released another mistake on your part you owe these five hundred and eighty three francs to the person who bought this note at barutin's sale and who has given my employer orders to prosecute the blood had risen to vantrasson's face and what of that do you suppose i've never been sued for debts before even the king can't take anything from a person who possesses nothing and i own nothing my furniture is all pawned or mortgaged and my stock is not worth a hundred francs when your employer finds it useless to waste money in worrying me he'll let me alone you can't injure a man like me do you really think so i'm sure of it unfortunately you are again mistaken for although the holder of the note doesn't care so very much about obtaining his dues he'll spend his own money like water to make trouble for you and thereupon m fortunat began to draw a vivid and frightful picture of a poor debtor pursued by a rich creditor who harassed him and tortured him and hounded him everywhere until not even a change of clothing was left him vantrasson rolled his eyes and brandished his formidable fist in the most defiant manner but his wife was evidently much alarmed at last she could bear it no longer and rising hastily she led her husband to the rear of the shop saying come i must speak with you he followed her and they remained for some little time conversing together in a low tone but with excited gestures when they returned the woman opened the conversation alas sir she said to m fortunat we have no"
