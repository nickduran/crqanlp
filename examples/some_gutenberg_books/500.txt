"1" "hunger was appeased started to grumble and cry that he wanted a new pair of feet but mastro geppetto in order to punish him for his mischief let him alone the whole morning after dinner he said to him why should i make your feet over again to see you run away from home once more i promise you answered the marionette sobbing that from now on i'll be good boys always promise that when they want something said geppetto i promise to go to school every day to study and to succeed boys always sing that song when they want their own will but i am not like other boys i am better than all of them and i always tell the truth i promise you father that i'll learn a trade and i'll be the comfort and staff of your old age geppetto though trying to look very stern felt his eyes fill with tears and his heart soften when he saw pinocchio so unhappy he said no more but taking his tools and two pieces of wood he set to work diligently in less than an hour the feet were finished two slender nimble little feet strong and quick modeled as if by an artist's hands close your eyes and sleep geppetto then said to the marionette pinocchio closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep while geppetto stuck on the two feet with a bit of glue melted in an eggshell doing his work so well that the joint could hardly be seen as soon as the marionette felt his new feet he gave one leap from the table and started to skip and jump around as if he had lost his head from very joy to show you how grateful i am to you father i'll go to school now but to go to school i need a suit of clothes geppetto did not have a penny in his pocket so he made his son a little suit of flowered paper a pair of shoes from the bark of a tree and a tiny cap from a bit of dough pinocchio ran to look at himself in a bowl of water and he felt so happy that he said proudly now i look like a gentleman truly answered geppetto but remember that fine clothes do not make the man unless they be neat and clean very true answered pinocchio but in order to go to school i still need something very important what is it an a b c book to be sure but how shall we get it that's easy we'll go to a bookstore and buy it and the money i have none neither have i said the old man sadly pinocchio although a happy boy always became sad and downcast at these words when poverty shows itself even mischievous boys understand what it means what does it matter after all cried geppetto all at once as he jumped up from his chair putting on his old coat full of darns and patches he ran out of the house without another word after a while he returned in his hands he had the a b c book for his son but the old coat was gone the poor fellow was in his shirt sleeves and the day was cold where's your coat father i have sold it why did you sell your coat it was too warm pinocchio understood the answer in a twinkling and unable to restrain his tears he jumped on his father's neck and kissed him over and over chapter 9 pinocchio sells his a b c book to pay his way into the marionette theater see pinocchio hurrying off to school with his new a b c book under his arm as he walked along his brain was busy planning hundreds of wonderful things building hundreds of castles in the air talking to himself he said in school today i'll learn to read tomorrow to write and the day after tomorrow i'll do arithmetic then clever as i am i can earn a lot of money with the very first pennies i make i'll buy father a new cloth coat cloth did i say no it shall be of gold and silver with diamond buttons that poor man certainly deserves it for after all isn't he in his shirt sleeves because he was good enough to buy a book for me on this cold day too fathers are indeed good to their children as he talked to himself he thought he heard sounds of pipes and drums coming from a distance pi pi pi pi pi pi zum zum zum zum he stopped to listen those sounds came from a little street that led to a small village along the shore what can that noise be what a nuisance that i have to go to school otherwise there he stopped very much puzzled he felt he had to make up his mind for either one thing or another should he go to school or should he follow the pipes today i'll follow the pipes and tomorrow i'll go to school there's always plenty of time to go to school decided the little rascal at last shrugging his shoulders no sooner said than done he started down the street going like the wind on he ran and louder grew the sounds of pipe and drum pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi zum zum zum zum suddenly he found himself in a large square full of people standing in front of a little wooden building painted in brilliant colors what is that house pinocchio asked a little boy near him read the sign and you'll know i'd like to read but somehow i can't today oh really then i'll read it to you know then that written in letters of fire i see the words great marionette theater when did the show start it is starting now and how much does one pay to get in four pennies pinocchio who was wild with curiosity to know what was going on inside lost all his pride and said to the boy shamelessly will you give me four pennies until tomorrow i'd give them to you gladly answered the other poking fun at him but just now i can't give them to you for the price of four pennies i'll sell you my coat if it rains what shall i do with a coat of flowered paper i could not take it off again do you want to buy my shoes they are only good enough to light a fire with what about my hat fine bargain indeed a cap of dough the mice might come and eat it from my head pinocchio was almost in tears he was just about to make one last offer but he lacked the courage to do so he hesitated he wondered he could not make up his mind at last he said will you give me four pennies for the book i am a boy and i buy nothing from boys said the little fellow with far more common sense than the marionette i'll give you four pennies for your a b c book said a ragpicker who stood by then and there the book changed hands and to think that poor old geppetto sat at home in his shirt sleeves shivering with cold having sold his coat to buy that little book for his son chapter 10 the marionettes recognize their brother pinocchio and greet him with loud cheers but the director fire eater happens along and poor pinocchio almost loses his life quick as a flash pinocchio disappeared into the marionette theater and then something happened which almost caused a riot the curtain was up and the performance had started harlequin and pulcinella were reciting on the stage and as usual they were threatening each other with sticks and blows the theater was full of people enjoying the spectacle and laughing till they cried at the antics of the two marionettes the play continued for a few minutes and then suddenly without any warning harlequin stopped talking turning toward the audience he pointed to the rear of the orchestra yelling wildly at the same time look look am i asleep or awake or do i really see pinocchio there yes yes it is pinocchio screamed pulcinella it is it is shrieked signora rosaura peeking in from the side of the stage it is pinocchio it is pinocchio yelled all the marionettes pouring out of the wings it is pinocchio it is our brother pinocchio hurrah for pinocchio pinocchio come up to me shouted harlequin come to the arms of your wooden brothers at such a loving invitation pinocchio with one leap from the back of the orchestra found himself in the front rows with another leap he was on the orchestra leader's head with a third he landed on the stage it is impossible to describe the shrieks of joy the warm embraces the knocks and the friendly greetings with which that strange company of dramatic actors and actresses received pinocchio it was a heart rending spectacle but the audience seeing that the play had stopped became angry and began to yell the play the play we want the play the yelling was of no use for the marionettes instead of going on with their act made twice as much racket as before and lifting up pinocchio on their shoulders carried him around the stage in triumph at that very moment the director came out of his room he had such a fearful appearance that one look at him would fill you with horror his beard was as black as pitch and so long that it reached from his chin down to his feet his mouth was as wide as an oven his teeth like yellow fangs and his eyes two glowing red coals in his huge hairy hands a long whip made of green snakes and black cats tails twisted together swished through the air in a dangerous way at the unexpected apparition no one dared even to breathe one could almost hear a fly go by those poor marionettes one and all trembled like leaves in a storm why have you brought such excitement into my theater the huge fellow asked pinocchio with the voice of an ogre suffering with a cold believe me your honor the fault was not mine enough be quiet i'll take care of you later as soon as the play was over the director went to the kitchen where a fine big lamb was slowly turning on the spit more wood was needed to finish cooking it he called harlequin and pulcinella and said to them bring that marionette to me he looks as if he were made of well seasoned wood he'll make a fine fire for this spit harlequin and pulcinella hesitated a bit then frightened by a look from their master they left the kitchen to obey him a few minutes later they returned carrying poor pinocchio who was wriggling and squirming like an eel and crying pitifully father save me i don't want to die i don't want to die chapter 11 fire eater sneezes and forgives pinocchio who saves his friend harlequin from death in the theater great excitement reigned fire eater this was really his name was very ugly but he was far from being as bad as he looked proof of this is that when he saw the poor marionette being brought in to him struggling with fear and crying i don't want to die i don't want to die he felt sorry for him and began first to waver and then to weaken finally he could control himself no longer and gave a loud sneeze at that sneeze harlequin who until then had been as sad as a weeping willow smiled happily and leaning toward the marionette whispered to him good news brother mine fire eater has sneezed and this is a sign that he feels sorry for you you are saved for be it known that while other people when sad and sorrowful weep and wipe their eyes fire eater on the other hand had the strange habit of sneezing each time he felt unhappy the way was just as good as any other to show the kindness of his heart after sneezing fire eater ugly as ever cried to pinocchio stop crying your wails give me a funny feeling down here in my stomach and e tchee e tchee two loud sneezes finished his speech god bless you said pinocchio thanks are your father and mother still living demanded fire eater my father yes my mother i have never known your poor father would suffer terribly if i were to use you as firewood poor old man i feel sorry for him e tchee e tchee e tchee three more sneezes sounded louder than ever god bless you said pinocchio thanks however i ought to be sorry for myself too just now my good dinner is spoiled i have no more wood for the fire and the lamb is only half cooked never mind in your place i'll burn some other marionette hey there officers at the call two wooden officers appeared long and thin as a yard of rope with queer hats on their heads and swords in their hands fire eater yelled at them in a hoarse voice take harlequin tie him and throw him on the fire i want my lamb well done think how poor harlequin felt he was so scared that his legs doubled up under him and he fell to the floor pinocchio at that heartbreaking sight threw himself at the feet of fire eater and weeping bitterly asked in a pitiful voice which could scarcely be heard have pity i beg of you signore there are no signori here have pity kind sir there are no sirs here have pity your excellency on hearing himself addressed as your excellency the director of the marionette theater sat up very straight in his chair stroked his long beard and becoming suddenly kind and compassionate smiled proudly as he said to pinocchio well what do you want from me now marionette i beg for mercy for my poor friend harlequin who has never done the least harm in his life there is no mercy here pinocchio i have spared you harlequin must burn in your place i am hungry and my dinner must be cooked in that case said pinocchio proudly as he stood up and flung away his cap of dough in that case my duty is clear come officers tie me up and throw me on those flames no it is not fair for poor harlequin the best friend that i have in the world to die in my place these brave words said in a piercing voice made all the other marionettes cry even the officers who were made of wood also cried like two babies fire eater at first remained hard and cold as a piece of ice but then little by little he softened and began to sneeze and after four or five sneezes he opened wide his arms and said to pinocchio you are a brave boy come to my arms and kiss me pinocchio ran to him and scurrying like a squirrel up the long black beard he gave fire eater a loving kiss on the tip of his nose has pardon been granted to me asked poor harlequin with a voice that was hardly a breath pardon is yours answered fire eater and sighing and wagging his head he added well tonight i shall have to eat my lamb only half cooked but beware the next time marionettes at the news that pardon had been given the marionettes ran to the stage and turning on all the lights they danced and sang till dawn chapter 12 fire eater gives pinocchio five gold pieces for his father geppetto but the marionette meets a fox and a cat and follows them the next day fire eater called pinocchio aside and asked him what is your father's name geppetto and what is his trade he's a wood carver does he earn much he earns so much that he never has a penny in his pockets just think that in order to buy me an a b c book for school he had to sell the only coat he owned a coat so full of darns and patches that it was a pity poor fellow i feel sorry for him here take these five gold pieces go give them to him with my kindest regards pinocchio as may easily be imagined thanked him a thousand times he kissed each marionette in turn even the officers and beside himself with joy set out on his homeward journey he had gone barely half a mile when he met a lame fox and a blind cat walking together like two good friends the lame fox leaned on the cat and the blind cat let the fox lead him along good morning pinocchio said the fox greeting him courteously how do you know my name asked the marionette i know your father well where have you seen him i saw him yesterday standing at the door of his house and what was he doing he was in his shirt sleeves trembling with cold poor father but after today god willing he will suffer no longer why because i have become a rich man you a rich man said the fox and he began to laugh out loud the cat was laughing also but tried to hide it by stroking his long whiskers there is nothing to laugh at cried pinocchio angrily i am very sorry to make your mouth water but these as you know are five new gold pieces and he pulled out the gold pieces which fire eater had given him at the cheerful tinkle of the gold the fox unconsciously held out his paw that was supposed to be lame and the cat opened wide his two eyes till they looked like live coals but he closed them again so quickly that pinocchio did not notice and may i ask inquired the fox what you are going to do with all that money first of all answered the marionette i want to buy a fine new coat for my father a coat of gold and silver with diamond buttons after that i'll buy an a b c book for myself for yourself for myself i want to go to school and study hard look at me said the fox for the silly reason of wanting to study i have lost a paw look at me said the cat for the same foolish reason i have lost the sight of both eyes at that moment a blackbird perched on the fence along the road called out sharp and clear pinocchio do not listen to bad advice if you do you'll be sorry poor little blackbird if he had only kept his words to himself in the twinkling of an eyelid the cat leaped on him and ate him feathers and all after eating the bird he cleaned his whiskers closed his eyes and became blind once more poor blackbird said pinocchio to the cat why did you kill him i killed him to teach him a lesson he talks too much next time he will keep his words to himself by this time the three companions had walked a long distance suddenly the fox stopped in his tracks and turning to the marionette said to him do you want to double your gold pieces what do you mean do you want one hundred a thousand two thousand gold pieces for your miserable five yes but how the way is very easy instead of returning home come with us and where will you take me to the city of simple simons pinocchio thought a while and then said firmly no i don't want to go home is near and i'm going where father is waiting for me how unhappy he must be that i have not yet returned i have been a bad son and the talking cricket was right when he said that a disobedient boy cannot be happy in this world i have learned this at my own expense even last night in the theater when fire eater brrrr the shivers run up and down my back at the mere thought of it well then said the fox if you really want to go home go ahead but you'll be sorry you'll be sorry repeated the cat think well pinocchio you are turning your back on dame fortune on dame fortune repeated the cat tomorrow your five gold pieces will be two thousand two thousand repeated the cat but how can they possibly become so many asked pinocchio wonderingly i'll explain said the fox you must know that just outside the city of simple simons there is a blessed field called the field of wonders in this field you dig a hole and in the hole you bury a gold piece after covering up the hole with earth you water it well sprinkle a bit of salt on it and go to bed during the night the gold piece sprouts grows blossoms and next morning you find a beautiful tree that is loaded with gold pieces so that if i were to bury my five gold pieces cried pinocchio with growing wonder next morning i should find how many it is very simple to figure out answered the fox why you can figure it on your fingers granted that each piece gives you five hundred multiply five hundred by five next morning you will find twenty five hundred new sparkling gold pieces fine fine cried pinocchio dancing about with joy and as soon as i have them i shall keep two thousand for myself and the other five hundred i'll give to you two a gift for us cried the fox pretending to be insulted why of course not of course not repeated the cat we do not work for gain answered the fox we work only to enrich others to enrich others repeated the cat what good people thought pinocchio to himself and forgetting his father the new coat the a b c book and all his good resolutions he said to the fox and to the cat let us go i am with you chapter 13 the inn of the red lobster cat and fox and marionette walked and walked and walked at last toward evening dead tired they came to the inn of the red lobster let us stop here a while said the fox to eat a bite and rest for a few hours at midnight we'll start out again for at dawn tomorrow we must be at the field of wonders they went into the inn and all three sat down at the same table however not one of them was very hungry the poor cat felt very weak and he was able to eat only thirty five mullets with tomato sauce and four portions of tripe with cheese moreover as he was so in need of strength he had to have four more helpings of butter and cheese the fox after a great deal of coaxing tried his best to eat a little the doctor had put him on a diet and he had to be satisfied with a small hare dressed with a dozen young and tender spring chickens after the hare he ordered some partridges a few pheasants a couple of rabbits and a dozen frogs and lizards that was all he felt ill he said and could not eat another bite pinocchio ate least of all he asked for a bite of bread and a few nuts and then hardly touched them the poor fellow with his mind on the field of wonders was suffering from a gold piece indigestion supper over the fox said to the innkeeper give us two good rooms one for mr pinocchio and the other for me and my friend before starting out we'll take a little nap remember to call us at midnight sharp for we must continue on our journey yes sir answered the innkeeper winking in a knowing way at the fox and the cat as if to say i understand as soon as pinocchio was in bed he fell fast asleep and began to dream he dreamed he was in the middle of a field the field was full of vines heavy with grapes the grapes were no other than gold coins which tinkled merrily as they swayed in the wind they seemed to say let him who wants us take us just as pinocchio stretched out his hand to take a handful of them he was awakened by three loud knocks at the door it was the innkeeper who had come to tell him that midnight had struck are my friends ready the marionette asked him indeed yes they went two hours ago why in such a hurry unfortunately the cat received a telegram which said that his first born was suffering from chilblains and was on the point of death he could not even wait to say good by to you did they pay for the supper how could they do such a thing being people of great refinement they did not want to offend you so deeply as not to allow you the honor of paying the bill too bad that offense would have been more than pleasing to me said pinocchio scratching his head where did my good friends say they would wait for me he added at the field of wonders at sunrise tomorrow morning pinocchio paid a gold piece for the three suppers and started on his way toward the field that was to make him a rich man he walked on not knowing where he was going for it was dark so dark that not a thing was visible round about him not a leaf stirred a few bats skimmed his nose now and again and scared him half to death once or twice he shouted who goes there and the far away hills echoed back to him who goes there who goes there who goes as he walked pinocchio noticed a tiny insect glimmering on the trunk of a tree a small being that glowed with a pale soft light who are you he asked i am the ghost of the talking cricket answered the little being in a faint voice that sounded as if it came from a far away world what do you want asked the marionette i want to give you a few words of good advice return home and give the four gold pieces you have left to your poor old father who is weeping because he has not seen you for many a day tomorrow my father will be a rich man for these four gold pieces will become two thousand don't listen to those who promise you wealth overnight my boy as a rule they are either fools or swindlers listen to me and go home but i want to go on the hour is late i want to go on the night is very dark i want to go on the road is dangerous i want to go on remember that boys who insist on having their own way sooner or later come to grief the same nonsense good by cricket good night pinocchio and may heaven preserve you from the assassins there was silence for a minute and the light of the talking cricket disappeared suddenly just as if someone had snuffed it out once again the road was plunged in darkness chapter 14 pinocchio not having listened to the good advice of the talking cricket falls into the hands of the assassins dear oh dear when i come to think of it said the marionette to himself as he once more set out on his journey we boys are really very unlucky everybody scolds us everybody gives us advice everybody warns us if we were to allow it everyone would try to be father and mother to us everyone even the talking cricket take me for example just because i would not listen to that bothersome cricket who knows how many misfortunes may be awaiting me assassins indeed at least i have never believed in them nor ever will to speak sensibly i think assassins have been invented by fathers and mothers to frighten children who want to run away at night and then even if i were to meet them on the road what matter i'll just run up to them and say well signori what do you want remember that you can't fool with me run along and mind your business at such a speech i can almost see those poor fellows running like the wind but in case they don't run away i can always run myself pinocchio was not given time to argue any longer for he thought he heard a slight rustle among the leaves behind him he turned to look and behold there in the darkness stood two big black shadows wrapped from head to foot in black sacks the two figures leaped toward him as softly as if they were ghosts here they come pinocchio said to himself and not knowing where to hide the gold pieces he stuck all four of them under his tongue he tried to run away but hardly had he taken a step when he felt his arms grasped and heard two horrible deep voices say to him your money or your life on account of the gold pieces in his"
