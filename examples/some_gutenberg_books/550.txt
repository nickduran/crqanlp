come there were no lips in raveloe from which a word could fall that would stir silas marner's benumbed faith to a sense of pain in the early ages of the world we know it was believed that each territory was inhabited and ruled by its own divinities so that a man could cross the bordering heights and be out of the reach of his native gods whose presence was confined to the streams and the groves and the hills among which he had lived from his birth and poor silas was vaguely conscious of something not unlike the feeling of primitive men when they fled thus in fear or in sullenness from the face of an unpropitious deity it seemed to him that the power he had vainly trusted in among the streets and at the prayer meetings was very far away from this land in which he had taken refuge where men lived in careless abundance knowing and needing nothing of that trust which for him had been turned to bitterness the little light he possessed spread its beams so narrowly that frustrated belief was a curtain broad enough to create for him the blackness of night his first movement after the shock had been to work in his loom and he went on with this unremittingly never asking himself why now he was come to raveloe he worked far on into the night to finish the tale of mrs osgood's table linen sooner than she expected without contemplating beforehand the money she would put into his hand for the work he seemed to weave like the spider from pure impulse without reflection every man's work pursued steadily tends in this way to become an end in itself and so to bridge over the loveless chasms of his life silas's hand satisfied itself with throwing the shuttle and his eye with seeing the little squares in the cloth complete themselves under his effort then there were the calls of hunger and silas in his solitude had to provide his own breakfast dinner and supper to fetch his own water from the well and put his own kettle on the fire and all these immediate promptings helped along with the weaving to reduce his life to the unquestioning activity of a spinning insect he hated the thought of the past there was nothing that called out his love and fellowship toward the strangers he had come amongst and the future was all dark for there was no unseen love that cared for him thought was arrested by utter bewilderment now its old narrow pathway was closed and affection seemed to have died under the bruise that had fallen on its keenest nerves but at last mrs osgood's table linen was finished and silas was paid in gold his earnings in his native town where he worked for a wholesale dealer had been after a lower rate he had been paid weekly and of his weekly earnings a large proportion had gone to objects of piety and charity now for the first time in his life he had five bright guineas put into his hand no man expected a share of them and he loved no man that he should offer him a share but what were the guineas to him who saw no vista beyond countless days of weaving it was needless for him to ask that for it was pleasant to him to feel them in his palm and look at their bright faces which were all his own it was another element of life like the weaving and the satisfaction of hunger subsisting quite aloof from the life of belief and love from which he had been cut off the weaver's hand had known the touch of hard won money even before the palm had grown to its full breadth for twenty years mysterious money had stood to him as the symbol of earthly good and the immediate object of toil he had seemed to love it little in the years when every penny had its purpose for him for he loved the _purpose_ then but now when all purpose was gone that habit of looking towards the money and grasping it with a sense of fulfilled effort made a loam that was deep enough for the seeds of desire and as silas walked homeward across the fields in the twilight he drew out the money and thought it was brighter in the gathering gloom about this time an incident happened which seemed to open a possibility of some fellowship with his neighbours one day taking a pair of shoes to be mended he saw the cobbler's wife seated by the fire suffering from the terrible symptoms of heart disease and dropsy which he had witnessed as the precursors of his mother's death he felt a rush of pity at the mingled sight and remembrance and recalling the relief his mother had found from a simple preparation of foxglove he promised sally oates to bring her something that would ease her since the doctor did her no good in this office of charity silas felt for the first time since he had come to raveloe a sense of unity between his past and present life which might have been the beginning of his rescue from the insect like existence into which his nature had shrunk but sally oates's disease had raised her into a personage of much interest and importance among the neighbours and the fact of her having found relief from drinking silas marner's stuff became a matter of general discourse when doctor kimble gave physic it was natural that it should have an effect but when a weaver who came from nobody knew where worked wonders with a bottle of brown waters the occult character of the process was evident such a sort of thing had not been known since the wise woman at tarley died and she had charms as well as stuff everybody went to her when their children had fits silas marner must be a person of the same sort for how did he know what would bring back sally oates's breath if he didn't know a fine sight more than that the wise woman had words that she muttered to herself so that you couldn't hear what they were and if she tied a bit of red thread round the child's toe the while it would keep off the water in the head there were women in raveloe at that present time who had worn one of the wise woman's little bags round their necks and in consequence had never had an idiot child as ann coulter had silas marner could very likely do as much and more and now it was all clear how he should have come from unknown parts and be so comical looking but sally oates must mind and not tell the doctor for he would be sure to set his face against marner he was always angry about the wise woman and used to threaten those who went to her that they should have none of his help any more silas now found himself and his cottage suddenly beset by mothers who wanted him to charm away the whooping cough or bring back the milk and by men who wanted stuff against the rheumatics or the knots in the hands and to secure themselves against a refusal the applicants brought silver in their palms silas might have driven a profitable trade in charms as well as in his small list of drugs but money on this condition was no temptation to him he had never known an impulse towards falsity and he drove one after another away with growing irritation for the news of him as a wise man had spread even to tarley and it was long before people ceased to take long walks for the sake of asking his aid but the hope in his wisdom was at length changed into dread for no one believed him when he said he knew no charms and could work no cures and every man and woman who had an accident or a new attack after applying to him set the misfortune down to master marner's ill will and irritated glances thus it came to pass that his movement of pity towards sally oates which had given him a transient sense of brotherhood heightened the repulsion between him and his neighbours and made his isolation more complete gradually the guineas the crowns and the half crowns grew to a heap and marner drew less and less for his own wants trying to solve the problem of keeping himself strong enough to work sixteen hours a day on as small an outlay as possible have not men shut up in solitary imprisonment found an interest in marking the moments by straight strokes of a certain length on the wall until the growth of the sum of straight strokes arranged in triangles has become a mastering purpose do we not wile away moments of inanity or fatigued waiting by repeating some trivial movement or sound until the repetition has bred a want which is incipient habit that will help us to understand how the love of accumulating money grows an absorbing passion in men whose imaginations even in the very beginning of their hoard showed them no purpose beyond it marner wanted the heaps of ten to grow into a square and then into a larger square and every added guinea while it was itself a satisfaction bred a new desire in this strange world made a hopeless riddle to him he might if he had had a less intense nature have sat weaving weaving looking towards the end of his pattern or towards the end of his web till he forgot the riddle and everything else but his immediate sensations but the money had come to mark off his weaving into periods and the money not only grew but it remained with him he began to think it was conscious of him as his loom was and he would on no account have exchanged those coins which had become his familiars for other coins with unknown faces he handled them he counted them till their form and colour were like the satisfaction of a thirst to him but it was only in the night when his work was done that he drew them out to enjoy their companionship he had taken up some bricks in his floor underneath his loom and here he had made a hole in which he set the iron pot that contained his guineas and silver coins covering the bricks with sand whenever he replaced them not that the idea of being robbed presented itself often or strongly to his mind hoarding was common in country districts in those days there were old labourers in the parish of raveloe who were known to have their savings by them probably inside their flock beds but their rustic neighbours though not all of them as honest as their ancestors in the days of king alfred had not imaginations bold enough to lay a plan of burglary how could they have spent the money in their own village without betraying themselves they would be obliged to run away a course as dark and dubious as a balloon journey so year after year silas marner had lived in this solitude his guineas rising in the iron pot and his life narrowing and hardening itself more and more into a mere pulsation of desire and satisfaction that had no relation to any other being his life had reduced itself to the functions of weaving and hoarding without any contemplation of an end towards which the functions tended the same sort of process has perhaps been undergone by wiser men when they have been cut off from faith and love only instead of a loom and a heap of guineas they have had some erudite research some ingenious project or some well knit theory strangely marner's face and figure shrank and bent themselves into a constant mechanical relation to the objects of his life so that he produced the same sort of impression as a handle or a crooked tube which has no meaning standing apart the prominent eyes that used to look trusting and dreamy now looked as if they had been made to see only one kind of thing that was very small like tiny grain for which they hunted everywhere and he was so withered and yellow that though he was not yet forty the children always called him old master marner yet even in this stage of withering a little incident happened which showed that the sap of affection was not all gone it was one of his daily tasks to fetch his water from a well a couple of fields off and for this purpose ever since he came to raveloe he had had a brown earthenware pot which he held as his most precious utensil among the very few conveniences he had granted himself it had been his companion for twelve years always standing on the same spot always lending its handle to him in the early morning so that its form had an expression for him of willing helpfulness and the impress of its handle on his palm gave a satisfaction mingled with that of having the fresh clear water one day as he was returning from the well he stumbled against the step of the stile and his brown pot falling with force against the stones that overarched the ditch below him was broken in three pieces silas picked up the pieces and carried them home with grief in his heart the brown pot could never be of use to him any more but he stuck the bits together and propped the ruin in its old place for a memorial this is the history of silas marner until the fifteenth year after he came to raveloe the livelong day he sat in his loom his ear filled with its monotony his eyes bent close down on the slow growth of sameness in the brownish web his muscles moving with such even repetition that their pause seemed almost as much a constraint as the holding of his breath but at night came his revelry at night he closed his shutters and made fast his doors and drew forth his gold long ago the heap of coins had become too large for the iron pot to hold them and he had made for them two thick leather bags which wasted no room in their resting place but lent themselves flexibly to every corner how the guineas shone as they came pouring out of the dark leather mouths the silver bore no large proportion in amount to the gold because the long pieces of linen which formed his chief work were always partly paid for in gold and out of the silver he supplied his own bodily wants choosing always the shillings and sixpences to spend in this way he loved the guineas best but he would not change the silver the crowns and half crowns that were his own earnings begotten by his labour he loved them all he spread them out in heaps and bathed his hands in them then he counted them and set them up in regular piles and felt their rounded outline between his thumb and fingers and thought fondly of the guineas that were only half earned by the work in his loom as if they had been unborn children thought of the guineas that were coming slowly through the coming years through all his life which spread far away before him the end quite hidden by countless days of weaving no wonder his thoughts were still with his loom and his money when he made his journeys through the fields and the lanes to fetch and carry home his work so that his steps never wandered to the hedge banks and the lane side in search of the once familiar herbs these too belonged to the past from which his life had shrunk away like a rivulet that has sunk far down from the grassy fringe of its old breadth into a little shivering thread that cuts a groove for itself in the barren sand but about the christmas of that fifteenth year a second great change came over marner's life and his history became blent in a singular manner with the life of his neighbours chapter iii the greatest man in raveloe was squire cass who lived in the large red house with the handsome flight of stone steps in front and the high stables behind it nearly opposite the church he was only one among several landed parishioners but he alone was honoured with the title of squire for though mr osgood's family was also understood to be of timeless origin the raveloe imagination having never ventured back to that fearful blank when there were no osgoods still he merely owned the farm he occupied whereas squire cass had a tenant or two who complained of the game to him quite as if he had been a lord it was still that glorious war time which was felt to be a peculiar favour of providence towards the landed interest and the fall of prices had not yet come to carry the race of small squires and yeomen down that road to ruin for which extravagant habits and bad husbandry were plentifully anointing their wheels i am speaking now in relation to raveloe and the parishes that resembled it for our old fashioned country life had many different aspects as all life must have when it is spread over a various surface and breathed on variously by multitudinous currents from the winds of heaven to the thoughts of men which are for ever moving and crossing each other with incalculable results raveloe lay low among the bushy trees and the rutted lanes aloof from the currents of industrial energy and puritan earnestness the rich ate and drank freely accepting gout and apoplexy as things that ran mysteriously in respectable families and the poor thought that the rich were entirely in the right of it to lead a jolly life besides their feasting caused a multiplication of orts which were the heirlooms of the poor betty jay scented the boiling of squire cass's hams but her longing was arrested by the unctuous liquor in which they were boiled and when the seasons brought round the great merry makings they were regarded on all hands as a fine thing for the poor for the raveloe feasts were like the rounds of beef and the barrels of ale they were on a large scale and lasted a good while especially in the winter time after ladies had packed up their best gowns and top knots in bandboxes and had incurred the risk of fording streams on pillions with the precious burden in rainy or snowy weather when there was no knowing how high the water would rise it was not to be supposed that they looked forward to a brief pleasure on this ground it was always contrived in the dark seasons when there was little work to be done and the hours were long that several neighbours should keep open house in succession so soon as squire cass's standing dishes diminished in plenty and freshness his guests had nothing to do but to walk a little higher up the village to mr osgood's at the orchards and they found hams and chines uncut pork pies with the scent of the fire in them spun butter in all its freshness everything in fact that appetites at leisure could desire in perhaps greater perfection though not in greater abundance than at squire cass's for the squire's wife had died long ago and the red house was without that presence of the wife and mother which is the fountain of wholesome love and fear in parlour and kitchen and this helped to account not only for there being more profusion than finished excellence in the holiday provisions but also for the frequency with which the proud squire condescended to preside in the parlour of the rainbow rather than under the shadow of his own dark wainscot perhaps also for the fact that his sons had turned out rather ill raveloe was not a place where moral censure was severe but it was thought a weakness in the squire that he had kept all his sons at home in idleness and though some licence was to be allowed to young men whose fathers could afford it people shook their heads at the courses of the second son dunstan commonly called dunsey cass whose taste for swopping and betting might turn out to be a sowing of something worse than wild oats to be sure the neighbours said it was no matter what became of dunsey a spiteful jeering fellow who seemed to enjoy his drink the more when other people went dry always provided that his doings did not bring trouble on a family like squire cass's with a monument in the church and tankards older than king george but it would be a thousand pities if mr godfrey the eldest a fine open faced good natured young man who was to come into the land some day should take to going along the same road with his brother as he had seemed to do of late if he went on in that way he would lose miss nancy lammeter for it was well known that she had looked very shyly on him ever since last whitsuntide twelvemonth when there was so much talk about his being away from home days and days together there was something wrong more than common that was quite clear for mr godfrey didn't look half so fresh coloured and open as he used to do at one time everybody was saying what a handsome couple he and miss nancy lammeter would make and if she could come to be mistress at the red house there would be a fine change for the lammeters had been brought up in that way that they never suffered a pinch of salt to be wasted and yet everybody in their household had of the best according to his place such a daughter in law would be a saving to the old squire if she never brought a penny to her fortune for it was to be feared that notwithstanding his incomings there were more holes in his pocket than the one where he put his own hand in but if mr godfrey didn't turn over a new leaf he might say good bye to miss nancy lammeter it was the once hopeful godfrey who was standing with his hands in his side pockets and his back to the fire in the dark wainscoted parlour one late november afternoon in that fifteenth year of silas marner's life at raveloe the fading grey light fell dimly on the walls decorated with guns whips and foxes brushes on coats and hats flung on the chairs on tankards sending forth a scent of flat ale and on a half choked fire with pipes propped up in the chimney corners signs of a domestic life destitute of any hallowing charm with which the look of gloomy vexation on godfrey's blond face was in sad accordance he seemed to be waiting and listening for some one's approach and presently the sound of a heavy step with an accompanying whistle was heard across the large empty entrance hall the door opened and a thick set heavy looking young man entered with the flushed face and the gratuitously elated bearing which mark the first stage of intoxication it was dunsey and at the sight of him godfrey's face parted with some of its gloom to take on the more active expression of hatred the handsome brown spaniel that lay on the hearth retreated under the chair in the chimney corner well master godfrey what do you want with me said dunsey in a mocking tone you're my elders and betters you know i was obliged to come when you sent for me why this is what i want and just shake yourself sober and listen will you said godfrey savagely he had himself been drinking more than was good for him trying to turn his gloom into uncalculating anger i want to tell you i must hand over that rent of fowler's to the squire or else tell him i gave it you for he's threatening to distrain for it and it'll all be out soon whether i tell him or not he said just now before he went out he should send word to cox to distrain if fowler didn't come and pay up his arrears this week the squire's short o cash and in no humour to stand any nonsense and you know what he threatened if ever he found you making away with his money again so see and get the money and pretty quickly will you oh said dunsey sneeringly coming nearer to his brother and looking in his face suppose now you get the money yourself and save me the trouble eh since you was so kind as to hand it over to me you'll not refuse me the kindness to pay it back for me it was your brotherly love made you do it you know godfrey bit his lips and clenched his fist don't come near me with that look else i'll knock you down oh no you won't said dunsey turning away on his heel however because i'm such a good natured brother you know i might get you turned out of house and home and cut off with a shilling any day i might tell the squire how his handsome son was married to that nice young woman molly farren and was very unhappy because he couldn't live with his drunken wife and i should slip into your place as comfortable as could be but you see i don't do it i'm so easy and good natured you'll take any trouble for me you'll get the hundred pounds for me i know you will how can i get the money said godfrey quivering i haven't a shilling to bless myself with and it's a lie that you'd slip into my place you'd get yourself turned out too that's all for if you begin telling tales i'll follow bob's my father's favourite you know that very well he'd only think himself well rid of you never mind said dunsey nodding his head sideways as he looked out of the window it ud be very pleasant to me to go in your company you're such a handsome brother and we've always been so fond of quarrelling with one another i shouldn't know what to do without you but you'd like better for us both to stay at home together i know you would so you'll manage to get that little sum o money and i'll bid you good bye though i'm sorry to part dunstan was moving off but godfrey rushed after him and seized him by the arm saying with an oath i tell you i have no money i can get no money borrow of old kimble i tell you he won't lend me any more and i shan't ask him well then sell wildfire yes that's easy talking i must have the money directly well you've only got to ride him to the hunt to morrow there'll be bryce and keating there for sure you'll get more bids than one i daresay and get back home at eight o'clock splashed up to the chin i'm going to mrs osgood's birthday dance oho said dunsey turning his head on one side and trying to speak in a small mincing treble and there's sweet miss nancy coming and we shall dance with her and promise never to be naughty again and be taken into favour and hold your tongue about miss nancy you fool said godfrey turning red else i'll throttle you what for said dunsey still in an artificial tone but taking a whip from the table and beating the butt end of it on his palm you've a very good chance i'd advise you to creep up her sleeve again it ud be saving time if molly should happen to take a drop too much laudanum some day and make a widower of you miss nancy wouldn't mind being a second if she didn't know it and you've got a good natured brother who'll keep your secret well because you'll be so very obliging to him i'll tell you what it is said godfrey quivering and pale again my patience is pretty near at an end if you'd a little more sharpness in you you might know that you may urge a man a bit too far and make one leap as easy as another i don't know but what it is so now i may as well tell the squire everything myself i should get you off my back if i got nothing else and after all he'll know some time she's been threatening to come herself and tell him so don't flatter yourself that your secrecy's worth any price you choose to ask you drain me of money till i have got nothing to pacify _her_ with and she'll do as she threatens some day it's all one i'll tell my father everything myself and you may go to the"
