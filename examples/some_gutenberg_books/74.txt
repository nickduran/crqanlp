of more innocents there was no lack of material boys happened along every little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash by the time ben was fagged out tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for a kite in good repair and when he played out johnny miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with and so on and so on hour after hour and when the middle of the afternoon came from being a poor poverty stricken boy in the morning tom was literally rolling in wealth he had besides the things before mentioned twelve marbles part of a jews harp a piece of blue bottle glass to look through a spool cannon a key that wouldn't unlock anything a fragment of chalk a glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles six fire crackers a kitten with only one eye a brass door knob a dog collar but no dog the handle of a knife four pieces of orange peel and a dilapidated old window sash he had had a nice good idle time all the while plenty of company and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it if he hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all he had discovered a great law of human action without knowing it namely that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain if he had been a great and wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do and this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread mill is work while rolling ten pins or climbing mont blanc is only amusement there are wealthy gentlemen in england who drive four horse passenger coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable money but if they were offered wages for the service that would turn it into work and then they would resign the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters to report chapter iii tom presented himself before aunt polly who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroom breakfast room dining room and library combined the balmy summer air the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her knitting for she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her lap her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety she had thought that of course tom had deserted long ago and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way he said mayn't i go and play now aunt what a'ready how much have you done it's all done aunt tom don't lie to me i can't bear it i ain't aunt it _is_ all done aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence she went out to see for herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent of tom's statement true when she found the entire fence white washed and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and even a streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable she said well i never there's no getting round it you can work when you're a mind to tom and then she diluted the compliment by adding but it's powerful seldom you're a mind to i'm bound to say well go long and play but mind you get back some time in a week or i'll tan you she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish he hooked a doughnut then he skipped out and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling they raged around sid like a hail storm and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect and tom was over the fence and gone there was a gate but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it his soul was at peace now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt's cow stable he presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square of the village where two military companies of boys had met for conflict according to previous appointment tom was general of one of these armies joe harper a bosom friend general of the other these two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person that being better suited to the still smaller fry but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides de camp tom's army won a great victory after a long and hard fought battle then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and marched away and tom turned homeward alone as he was passing by the house where jeff thatcher lived he saw a new girl in the garden a lovely little blue eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long tails white summer frock and embroidered pan talettes the fresh crowned hero fell without firing a shot a certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind he had thought he loved her to distraction he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality he had been months winning her she had confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that she had discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present and began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order to win her admiration he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time but by and by while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house tom came up to the fence and leaned on it grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer she halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold but his face lit up right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to side in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finally his bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner but only for a minute only while he could button the flower inside his jacket next his heart or next his stomach possibly for he was not much posted in anatomy and not hypercritical anyway he returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window meantime and been aware of his attentions finally he strode home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered what had got into the child he took a good scolding about clodding sid and did not seem to mind it in the least he tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it he said aunt you don't whack sid when he takes it well sid don't torment a body the way you do you'd be always into that sugar if i warn't watching you presently she stepped into the kitchen and sid happy in his immunity reached for the sugar bowl a sort of glorying over tom which was wellnigh unbearable but sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke tom was in ecstasies in such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent he said to himself that he would not speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model catch it he was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles he said to himself now it's coming and the next instant he was sprawling on the floor the potent palm was uplifted to strike again when tom cried out hold on now what er you belting _me_ for sid broke it aunt polly paused perplexed and tom looked for healing pity but when she got her tongue again she only said umf well you didn't get a lick amiss i reckon you been into some other audacious mischief when i wasn't around like enough then her conscience reproached her and she yearned to say something kind and loving but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong and discipline forbade that so she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes he knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it he would hang out no signals he would take notice of none he knew that a yearning glance fell upon him now and then through a film of tears but he refused recognition of it he pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word but he would turn his face to the wall and die with that word unsaid ah how would she feel then and he pictured himself brought home from the river dead with his curls all wet and his sore heart at rest how she would throw herself upon him and how her tears would fall like rain and her lips pray god to give her back her boy and she would never never abuse him any more but he would lie there cold and white and make no sign a poor little sufferer whose griefs were at an end he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams that he had to keep swallowing he was so like to choke and his eyes swam in a blur of water which overflowed when he winked and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose and such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it it was too sacred for such contact and so presently when his cousin mary danced in all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age long visit of one week to the country he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit a log raft in the river invited him and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream wishing the while that he could only be drowned all at once and unconsciously without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature then he thought of his flower he got it out rumpled and wilted and it mightily increased his dismal felicity he wondered if she would pity him if she knew would she cry and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights till he wore it threadbare at last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness about half past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to where the adored unknown lived he paused a moment no sound fell upon his listening ear a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second story window was the sacred presence there he climbed the fence threaded his stealthy way through the plants till he stood under that window he looked up at it long and with emotion then he laid him down on the ground under it disposing himself upon his back with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower and thus he would die out in the cold world with no shelter over his homeless head no friendly hand to wipe the death damps from his brow no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came and thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning and oh would she drop one little tear upon his poor lifeless form would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted so untimely cut down the window went up a maid servant's discordant voice profaned the holy calm and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort there was a whiz as of a missile in the air mingled with the murmur of a curse a sound as of shivering glass followed and a small vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom not long after as tom all undressed for bed was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip sid woke up but if he had any dim idea of making any references to allusions he thought better of it and held his peace for there was danger in tom's eye tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers and sid made mental note of the omission chapter iv the sun rose upon a tranquil world and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction breakfast over aunt polly had family worship it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of scriptural quotations welded together with a thin mortar of originality and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the mosaic law as from sinai then tom girded up his loins so to speak and went to work to get his verses sid had learned his lesson days before tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses and he chose part of the sermon on the mount because he could find no verses that were shorter at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson but no more for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought and his hands were busy with distracting recreations mary took his book to hear him recite and he tried to find his way through the fog blessed are the a a poor yes poor blessed are the poor a a in spirit in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for they they _theirs_ for _theirs_ blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they they sh for they a s h a for they s h oh i don't know what it is _shall_ oh _shall_ for they shall for they shall a a shall mourn a a blessed are they that shall they that a they that shall mourn for they shall a shall _what_ why don't you tell me mary what do you want to be so mean for oh tom you poor thick headed thing i'm not teasing you i wouldn't do that you must go and learn it again don't you be discouraged tom you'll manage it and if you do i'll give you something ever so nice there now that's a good boy all right what is it mary tell me what it is never you mind tom you know if i say it's nice it is nice you bet you that's so mary all right i'll tackle it again and he did tackle it again and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success mary gave him a brand new barlow knife worth twelve and a half cents and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations true the knife would not cut anything but it was a sure enough barlow and there was inconceivable grandeur in that though where the western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so perhaps tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it and was arranging to begin on the bureau when he was called off to dress for sunday school mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleeves poured out the water on the ground gently and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door but mary removed the towel and said now ain't you ashamed tom you mustn't be so bad water won't hurt you tom was a trifle disconcerted the basin was refilled and this time he stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a big breath and began when he entered the kitchen presently with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face but when he emerged from the towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck mary took him in hand and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother without distinction of color and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect he privately smoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered his hair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate and his own filled his life with bitterness then mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years they were simply called his other clothes and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe the girl put him to rights after he had dressed himself she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat he now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him he hoped that mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted she coated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought them out he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn't want to do but mary said persuasively please tom that's a good boy so he got into the shoes snarling mary was soon ready and the three children set out for sunday school a place that tom hated with his whole heart but sid and mary were fond of it sabbath school hours were from nine to half past ten and then church service two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily and the other always remained too for stronger reasons the church's high backed uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sort of pine board tree box on top of it for a steeple at the door tom dropped back a step and accosted a sunday dressed comrade say billy got a yaller ticket yes what'll you take for her what'll you give piece of lickrish and a fish hook less see em tom exhibited they were satisfactory and the property changed hands then tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones he waylaid other boys as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer he entered the church now with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy the teacher a grave elderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and tom pulled a boy's hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hear him say ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher tom's whole class were of a pattern restless noisy and troublesome when they came to recite their lessons not one of them knew his verses perfectly but had to be prompted all along however they worried through and each got his reward in small blue tickets each with a passage of scripture on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation ten blue tickets equalled a red one and could be exchanged for it ten red tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound bible worth forty cents in those easy times to the pupil how many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses even for a dore bible and yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way it was the patient work of two years and a boy of german parentage had won four or five he once recited three thousand verses without stopping but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth a grievous misfortune for the school for on great occasions before company the superintendent as tom expressed it had always made this boy come out and spread himself only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a bible and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks it is possible that tom's mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit with a closed hymn book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves and commanded attention when a sunday school superintendent makes his customary little speech a hymn book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert though why is a mystery for neither the hymn book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer this superintendent was a slim creature of thirty five with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair he wore a stiff standing collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank note and had fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in the fashion of the day like sleigh runners an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together mr walters was very earnest of mien and very sincere and honest at heart and he held sacred things and places in such reverence and so separated them from worldly matters that unconsciously to himself his sunday school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week days he began after this fashion now children i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two there that is it that is the way good little boys and girls should do i see one little girl who is looking out of the window i am afraid she thinks i am out there somewhere perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds applausive titter i want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright clean little faces assembled in a place like this learning to do right and be good and so forth and so on it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration it was of a pattern which does not vary and so it is familiar to us all the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary but now every sound ceased suddenly with the subsidence of mr walters voice and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare the entrance of visitors lawyer thatcher accompanied by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middle aged gentleman with iron gray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife the lady was leading a child tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings conscience smitten too he could not meet amy lawrence's eye he could not brook her loving gaze but when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment the next moment he was showing off with all his might cuffing boys pulling hair making faces in a word using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause his exaltation had but one alloy the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden and that record in sand was fast washing out under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now the visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as mr walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school the middle aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage no less a one than the county judge
