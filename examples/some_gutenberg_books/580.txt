"1" "sir cold lamp post very good but lamp post inconvenient damned odd standing in the open street half an hour with your eye against a lamp post eh very good ha ha and the stranger without stopping to take breath swallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandy and water and flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon had occurred while his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their thanks to their new acquaintance mr pickwick had leisure to examine his costume and appearance he was about the middle height but the thinness of his body and the length of his legs gave him the appearance of being much taller the green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow tails but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the stranger for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists it was buttoned closely up to his chin at the imminent hazard of splitting the back and an old stock without a vestige of shirt collar ornamented his neck his scanty black trousers displayed here and there those shiny patches which bespeak long service and were strapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes as if to conceal the dirty white stockings which were nevertheless distinctly visible his long black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath each side of his old pinched up hat and glimpses of his bare wrists might be observed between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his coat sleeves his face was thin and haggard but an indescribable air of jaunty impudence and perfect self possession pervaded the whole man such was the individual on whom mr pickwick gazed through his spectacles which he had fortunately recovered and to whom he proceeded when his friends had exhausted themselves to return in chosen terms his warmest thanks for his recent assistance never mind said the stranger cutting the address very short said enough no more smart chap that cabman handled his fives well but if i'd been your friend in the green jemmy damn me punch his head cod i would pig's whisper pieman too no gammon this coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the rochester coachman to announce that the commodore was on the point of starting commodore said the stranger starting up my coach place booked one outside leave you to pay for the brandy and water want change for a five bad silver brummagem buttons won't do no go eh and he shook his head most knowingly now it so happened that mr pickwick and his three companions had resolved to make rochester their first halting place too and having intimated to their new found acquaintance that they were journeying to the same city they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach where they could all sit together up with you said the stranger assisting mr pickwick on to the roof with so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman's deportment very materially any luggage sir inquired the coachman who i brown paper parcel here that's all other luggage gone by water packing cases nailed up big as houses heavy heavy damned heavy replied the stranger as he forced into his pocket as much as he could of the brown paper parcel which presented most suspicious indications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief heads heads take care of your heads cried the loquacious stranger as they came out under the low archway which in those days formed the entrance to the coach yard terrible place dangerous work other day five children mother tall lady eating sandwiches forgot the arch crash knock children look round mother's head off sandwich in her hand no mouth to put it in head of a family off shocking shocking looking at whitehall sir fine place little window somebody else's

pen and ink back again cut and slash noble time sir sportsman sir abruptly turning to mr winkle a remarkable instance of the prophetic force of mr jingle's imagination this dialogue occurring in the year 1827 and the revolution in 1830 a little sir replied that gentleman fine pursuit sir fine pursuit dogs sir not just now said mr winkle ah you should keep dogs fine animals sagacious creatures dog

staring at a board looked up saw an inscription gamekeeper has orders to shoot all dogs found in this inclosure wouldn't pass it wonderful dog valuable dog that very singular circumstance that said mr pickwick will you allow me to make a note of it certainly sir certainly hundred more anecdotes of the same animal fine girl sir to mr tracy tupman who had been bestowing sundry anti pickwickian glances on a young lady by the roadside very said mr tupman english girls not so fine as spanish noble creatures jet hair black eyes lovely forms sweet creatures beautiful you have been in spain sir said mr tracy tupman lived there ages many conquests sir inquired mr tupman conquests thousands don bolaro fizzgig grandee only daughter donna christina splendid creature loved me to distraction jealous father high souled daughter handsome englishman donna christina in despair prussic acid stomach pump in my portmanteau operation performed old bolaro in ecstasies consent to our union join hands and floods of tears romantic story very is the lady in england now sir inquired mr tupman on whom the description of her charms had produced a powerful impression dead sir dead said the stranger applying to his right eye the brief remnant of a very old cambric handkerchief never recovered the stomach pump undermined constitution fell a victim and her father inquired the poetic snodgrass remorse and misery replied the stranger sudden disappearance talk of the whole city search made everywhere without success public fountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing weeks elapsed still a stoppage workmen employed to clean it water drawn off father in law discovered sticking head first in the main pipe with a full confession in his right boot took him out and the fountain played away again as well as ever will you allow me to note that little romance down sir said mr snodgrass deeply affected certainly sir certainly fifty more if you like to hear em strange life mine rather curious history not extraordinary but singular in this strain with an occasional glass of ale by way of parenthesis when the coach changed horses did the stranger proceed until they reached rochester bridge by which time the note books both of mr pickwick and mr snodgrass were completely filled with selections from his adventures magnificent ruin said mr augustus snodgrass with all the poetic fervour that distinguished him when they came in sight of the fine old castle what a study for an antiquarian were the very words which fell from mr pickwick's mouth as he applied his telescope to his eye ah fine place said the stranger glorious pile frowning walls tottering arches dark nooks crumbling staircases old cathedral too earthy smell pilgrims feet wore away the old steps little saxon doors confessionals like money takers boxes at theatres queer customers those monks popes and lord treasurers and all sorts of old fellows with great red faces and broken noses turning up every day buff jerkins too match locks sarcophagus fine place old legends too strange stories capital and the stranger continued to soliloquise until they reached the bull inn in the high street where the coach stopped do you remain here sir inquired mr nathaniel winkle here not i but you'd better good house nice beds wright's next house dear very dear half a crown in the bill if you look at the waiter charge you more if you dine at a friend's than they would if you dined in the coffee room rum fellows very mr winkle turned to mr pickwick and murmured a few words a whisper passed from mr pickwick to mr snodgrass from mr snodgrass to mr tupman and nods of assent were exchanged mr pickwick addressed the stranger you rendered us a very important service this morning sir said he will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner great pleasure not presume to dictate but broiled fowl and mushrooms capital thing what time let me see replied mr pickwick referring to his watch it is now nearly three shall we say five suit me excellently said the stranger five precisely till then care of yourselves and lifting the pinched up hat a few inches from his head and carelessly replacing it very much on one side the stranger with half the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket walked briskly up the yard and turned into the high street evidently a traveller in many countries and a close observer of men and things said mr pickwick i should like to see his poem said mr snodgrass i should like to have seen that dog said mr winkle mr tupman said nothing but he thought of donna christina the stomach pump and the fountain and his eyes filled with tears a private sitting room having been engaged bedrooms inspected and dinner ordered the party walked out to view the city and adjoining neighbourhood we do not find from a careful perusal of mr pickwick's notes of the four towns stroud rochester chatham and brompton that his impressions of their appearance differ in any material point from those of other travellers who have gone over the same ground his general description is easily abridged the principal productions of these towns says mr pickwick appear to be soldiers sailors jews chalk shrimps officers and dockyard men the commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine stores hard bake apples flat fish and oysters the streets present a lively and animated appearance occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of the military it is truly delightful to a philanthropic mind to see these gallant men staggering along under the influence of an overflow both of animal and ardent spirits more especially when we remember that the following them about and jesting with them affords a cheap and innocent amusement for the boy population nothing adds mr pickwick can exceed their good humour it was but the day before my arrival that one of them had been most grossly insulted in the house of a publican the barmaid had positively refused to draw him any more liquor in return for which he had merely in playfulness drawn his bayonet and wounded the girl in the shoulder and yet this fine fellow was the very first to go down to the house next morning and express his readiness to overlook the matter and forget what had occurred the consumption of tobacco in these towns continues mr pickwick must be very great and the smell which pervades the streets must be exceedingly delicious to those who are extremely fond of smoking a superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying punctual to five o'clock came the stranger and shortly afterwards the dinner he had divested himself of his brown paper parcel but had made no alteration in his attire and was if possible more loquacious than ever what's that he inquired as the waiter removed one of the covers soles sir soles ah capital fish all come from london stage coach proprietors get up political dinners carriage of soles dozens of baskets cunning fellows glass of wine sir with pleasure said mr pickwick and the stranger took wine first with him and then with mr snodgrass and then with mr tupman and then with mr winkle and then with the whole party together almost as rapidly as he talked devil of a mess on the staircase waiter said the stranger forms going up carpenters coming down lamps glasses harps what's going forward ball sir said the waiter assembly eh no sir not assembly sir ball for the benefit of a charity sir many fine women in this town do you know sir inquired mr tupman with great interest splendid capital kent sir everybody knows kent apples cherries hops and women glass of wine sir with great pleasure replied mr tupman the stranger filled and emptied i should very much like to go said mr tupman resuming the subject of the ball very much tickets at the bar sir interposed the waiter half a guinea each sir mr tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the festivity but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of mr snodgrass or the abstracted gaze of mr pickwick he applied himself with great interest to the port wine and dessert which had just been placed on the table the waiter withdrew and the party were left to enjoy the cosy couple of hours succeeding dinner beg your pardon sir said the stranger bottle stands pass it round way of the sun through the button hole no heeltaps and he emptied his glass which he had filled about two minutes before and poured out another with the air of a man who was used to it the wine was passed and a fresh supply ordered the visitor talked the pickwickians listened mr tupman felt every moment more disposed for the ball mr pickwick's countenance glowed with an expression of universal philanthropy and mr winkle and mr snodgrass fell fast asleep they're beginning upstairs said the stranger hear the company fiddles tuning now the harp there they go the various sounds which found their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first quadrille how i should like to go said mr tupman again so should i said the stranger confounded luggage heavy smacks nothing to go in odd ain't it now general benevolence was one of the leading features of the pickwickian theory and no one was more remarkable for the zealous manner in which he observed so noble a principle than mr tracy tupman the number of instances recorded on the transactions of the society in which that excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of other members for left off garments or pecuniary relief is almost incredible i should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the purpose said mr tracy tupman but you are rather slim and i am rather fat grown up bacchus cut the leaves dismounted from the tub and adopted kersey eh not double distilled but double milled ha ha pass the wine whether mr tupman was somewhat indignant at the peremptory tone in which he was desired to pass the wine which the stranger passed so quickly away or whether he felt very properly scandalised at an influential member of the pickwick club being ignominiously compared to a dismounted bacchus is a fact not yet completely ascertained he passed the wine coughed twice and looked at the stranger for several seconds with a stern intensity as that individual however appeared perfectly collected and quite calm under his searching glance he gradually relaxed and reverted to the subject of the ball i was about to observe sir he said that though my apparel would be too large a suit of my friend mr winkle's would perhaps fit you better the stranger took mr winkle's measure with his eye and that feature glistened with satisfaction as he said just the thing mr tupman looked round him the wine which had exerted its somniferous influence over mr snodgrass and mr winkle had stolen upon the senses of mr pickwick that gentleman had gradually passed through the various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner and its consequences he had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality like a gas lamp in the street with the wind in the pipe he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy then sank so low as to be scarcely discernible after a short interval he had burst out again to enlighten for a moment then flickered with an uncertain staggering sort of light and then gone out altogether his head was sunk upon his bosom and perpetual snoring with a partial choke occasionally were the only audible indications of the great man's presence the temptation to be present at the ball and to form his first impressions of the beauty of the kentish ladies was strong upon mr tupman the temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great he was wholly unacquainted with the place and its inhabitants and the stranger seemed to possess as great a knowledge of both as if he had lived there from his infancy mr winkle was asleep and mr tupman had had sufficient experience in such matters to know that the moment he awoke he would in the ordinary course of nature roll heavily to bed he was undecided fill your glass and pass the wine said the indefatigable visitor mr tupman did as he was requested and the additional stimulus of the last glass settled his determination winkle's bedroom is inside mine said mr tupman i couldn't make him understand what i wanted if i woke him now but i know he has a dress suit in a carpet bag and supposing you wore it to the ball and took it off when we returned i could replace it without troubling him at all about the matter capital said the stranger famous plan damned odd situation fourteen coats in the packing cases and obliged to wear another man's very good notion that very we must purchase our tickets said mr tupman not worth while splitting a guinea said the stranger toss who shall pay for both i call you spin first time woman woman bewitching woman and down came the sovereign with the dragon called by courtesy a woman uppermost mr tupman rang the bell purchased the tickets and ordered chamber candlesticks in another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely arrayed in a full suit of mr nathaniel winkle's it's a new coat said mr tupman as the stranger surveyed himself with great complacency in a cheval glass the first that's been made with our club button and he called his companions attention to the large gilt button which displayed a bust of mr pickwick in the centre and the letters p c on either side p c said the stranger queer set out old fellow's likeness and p c what does p c stand for peculiar coat eh mr tupman with rising indignation and great importance explained the mystic device rather short in the waist ain't it said the stranger screwing himself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons which were half way up his back like a general postman's coat queer coats those made by contract no measuring mysterious dispensations of providence all the short men get long coats all the long men short ones running on in this way mr tupman's new companion adjusted his dress or rather the dress of mr winkle and accompanied by mr tupman ascended the staircase leading to the ballroom what names sir said the man at the door mr tracy tupman was stepping forward to announce his own titles when the stranger prevented him no names at all and then he whispered mr tupman names won't do not known very good names in their way but not great ones capital names for a small party but won't make an impression in public assemblies incog the thing gentlemen from london distinguished foreigners anything the door was thrown open and mr tracy tupman and the stranger entered the ballroom it was a long room with crimson covered benches and wax candles in glass chandeliers the musicians were securely confined in an elevated den and quadrilles were being systematically got through by two or three sets of dancers two card tables were made up in the adjoining card room and two pair of old ladies and a corresponding number of stout gentlemen were executing whist therein the finale concluded the dancers promenaded the room and mr tupman and his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company charming women said mr tupman wait a minute said the stranger fun presently nobs not come yet queer place dockyard people of upper rank don't know dockyard people of lower rank dockyard people of lower rank don't know small gentry small gentry don't know tradespeople commissioner don't know anybody who's that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes in a fancy dress inquired mr tupman hush pray pink eyes fancy dress little boy nonsense ensign 97th honourable wilmot snipe great family snipes very sir thomas clubber lady clubber and the misses clubber shouted the man at the door in a stentorian voice a great sensation was created throughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons a large lady in blue satin and two young ladies on a similar scale in fashionably made dresses of the same hue commissioner head of the yard great man remarkably great man whispered the stranger in mr tupman's ear as the charitable committee ushered sir thomas clubber and family to the top of the room the honourable wilmot snipe and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to render homage to the misses clubber and sir thomas clubber stood bolt upright and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the assembled company mr smithie mrs smithie and the misses smithie was the next announcement what's mr smithie inquired mr tracy tupman something in the yard replied the stranger mr smithie bowed deferentially to sir thomas clubber and sir thomas clubber acknowledged the salute with conscious condescension lady clubber took a telescopic view of mrs smithie and family through her eye glass and mrs smithie stared in her turn at mrs somebody else whose husband was not in the dockyard at all colonel bulder mrs colonel bulder and miss bulder were the next arrivals head of the garrison said the stranger in reply to mr tupman's inquiring look miss bulder was warmly welcomed by the misses clubber the greeting between mrs colonel bulder and lady clubber was of the most affectionate description colonel bulder and sir thomas clubber exchanged snuff boxes and looked very much like a pair of alexander selkirks monarchs of all they surveyed while the aristocracy of the place the bulders and clubbers and snipes were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the room the other classes of society were imitating their example in other parts of it the less aristocratic officers of the 97th devoted themselves to the families of the less important functionaries from the dockyard the solicitors wives and the wine merchant's wife headed another grade the brewer's wife visited the bulders and mrs tomlinson the post office keeper seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader of the trade party one of the most popular personages in his own circle present was a little fat man with a ring of upright black hair round his head and an extensive bald plain on the top of it doctor slammer surgeon to the 97th the doctor took snuff with everybody chatted with everybody laughed danced made jokes played whist did everything and was everywhere to these pursuits multifarious as they were the little doctor added a more important one than any he was indefatigable in paying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow whose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable addition to a limited income upon the doctor and the widow the eyes of both mr tupman and his companion had been fixed for some time when the stranger broke silence lots of money old girl pompous doctor not a bad idea good fun were the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips mr tupman looked inquisitively in his face i'll dance with the widow said the stranger who is she inquired mr tupman don't know never saw her in all my life cut out the doctor here goes and the stranger forthwith crossed the room and leaning against a mantel piece commenced gazing with an air of respectful and melancholy admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady mr tupman looked on in mute astonishment the stranger progressed rapidly the little doctor danced with another lady the widow dropped her fan the stranger picked it up and presented it a smile a bow a curtsey a few words of conversation the stranger walked boldly up to and returned with the master of the ceremonies a little introductory pantomime and the stranger and mrs budger took their places in a quadrille the surprise of mr tupman at this summary proceeding great as it was was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor the stranger was young and the widow was flattered the doctor's attentions were unheeded by the widow and the doctor's indignation was wholly lost on his imperturbable rival doctor slammer was paralysed he doctor slammer of the 97th to be extinguished in a moment by a man whom nobody had ever seen before and whom nobody knew even now doctor slammer doctor slammer of the 97th rejected impossible it could not be yes it was there they were what introducing his friend could he believe his eyes he looked again and was under the painful necessity of admitting the veracity of his optics mrs budger was dancing with mr tracy tupman there was no mistaking the fact there was the widow before him bouncing bodily here and there with unwonted vigour and mr tracy tupman hopping about with a face expressive of the most intense solemnity dancing as a good many people do as if a quadrille were not a thing to be laughed at but a severe trial to the feelings which it requires inflexible resolution to encounter silently and patiently did the doctor bear all this and all the handings of negus and watching for glasses and darting for biscuits and coquetting that ensued but a few seconds after the stranger had disappeared to lead mrs budger to her carriage he darted swiftly from the room with every particle of his hitherto bottled up indignation effervescing from all parts of his countenance in a perspiration of passion the stranger was returning and mr tupman was beside him he spoke in a low tone and laughed the little doctor thirsted for his life he was exulting he had triumphed sir said the doctor in an awful voice producing a card and retiring into an angle of the passage my name is slammer doctor slammer sir 97th regiment chatham barracks my card sir my card he would have added more but his indignation choked him ah replied the stranger coolly slammer much obliged polite attention not ill now slammer but when i am knock you up you you're a shuffler sir gasped the furious doctor a poltroon a coward a liar a a will nothing induce you to give me your card sir oh i see said the stranger half aside negus too strong here liberal landlord very foolish very lemonade much better hot rooms elderly gentlemen suffer for it in the morning cruel cruel and he moved on a step or two you are stopping in this house sir said the indignant little man you are intoxicated now sir you shall hear from me in the morning sir i shall find you out sir i shall find you out rather you found me out than found me at home replied the unmoved stranger doctor slammer looked unutterable ferocity as he fixed his hat on his head with an indignant knock and the stranger and mr tupman ascended to the bedroom of the latter to restore the borrowed plumage to the unconscious winkle that gentleman was fast asleep the restoration was soon made the stranger was extremely jocose and mr tracy tupman being quite bewildered with wine negus lights and ladies thought the whole affair was an exquisite joke his new friend departed and after experiencing some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his nightcap originally intended for the reception of his head and finally overturning his candlestick in his struggles to put it on mr tracy tupman managed to get into bed by a series of complicated evolutions and shortly afterwards sank"
