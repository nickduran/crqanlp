"1" "with five legs instead of four i might have rested his defence upon the license allowed to that branch of his profession which as it permits all sorts of singular and irregular combinations may be allowed to extend itself so far as to bestow a limb supernumerary on a favourite subject but the cause of a deceased friend is sacred and i disdain to bottom it so superficially i have visited the sign in question which yet swings exalted in the village of langdirdum and i am ready to depone upon the oath that what has been idly mistaken or misrepresented as being the fifth leg of the horse is in fact the tail of that quadruped and considered with reference to the posture in which he is delineated forms a circumstance introduced and managed with great and successful though daring art the nag being represented in a rampant or rearing posture the tail which is prolonged till it touches the ground appears to form a point d'appui and gives the firmness of a tripod to the figure without which it would be difficult to conceive placed as the feet are how the courser could maintain his ground without tumbling backwards this bold conception has fortunately fallen into the custody of one by whom it is duly valued for when dick in his more advanced state of proficiency became dubious of the propriety of so daring a deviation to execute a picture of the publican himself in exchange for this juvenile production the courteous offer was declined by his judicious employer who had observed it seems that when his ale failed to do its duty in conciliating his guests one glance at his sign was sure to put them in good humour it would be foreign to my present purpose to trace the steps by which dick tinto improved his touch and corrected by the rules of art the luxuriance of a fervid imagination the scales fell from his eyes on viewing the sketches of a contemporary the scottish teniers as wilkie has been deservedly styled he threw down the brush took up the crayons and amid hunger and toil and suspense and uncertainty pursued the path of his profession under better auspices than those of his original master still the first rude emanations of his genius like the nursery rhymes of pope could these be recovered will be dear to the companions of dick tinto's youth there is a tankard and gridiron painted over the door of an obscure change house in the back wynd of gandercleugh but i feel i must tear myself from the subject or dwell on it too long amid his wants and struggles dick tinto had recourse like his brethren to levying that tax upon the vanity of mankind which he could not extract from their taste and liberality on a word he painted portraits it was in this more advanced state of proficiency when dick had soared above his original line of business and highly disdained any allusion to it that after having been estranged for several years we again met in the village of gandercleugh i holding my present situation and dick painting copies of the human face divine at a guinea per head this was a small premium yet in the first burst of business it more than sufficed for all dick's moderate wants so that he occupied an apartment at the wallace inn cracked his jest with impunity even upon mine host himself and lived in respect and observance with the chambermaid hostler and waiter those halcyon days were too serene to last long when his honour the laird of gandercleugh with his wife and three daughters the minister the gauger mine esteemed patron mr jedediah cleishbotham and some round dozen of the feuars and farmers had been consigned to immortality by tinto's brush custom began to slacken and it was impossible to wring more than crowns and half crowns from the hard hands of the peasants whose ambition led them to dick's painting room still though the horizon was overclouded no storm for some time ensued mine host had christian faith with a lodger who had been a good paymaster as long as he had the means and from a portrait of our landlord himself grouped with his wife and daughters in the style of rubens which suddenly appeared in the best parlour it was evident that dick had found some mode of bartering art for the necessaries of life nothing however is more precarious than resources of this nature it was observed that dick became in his turn the whetstone of mine host's wit without venturing either at defence or retaliation that his easel was transferred to a garret room in which there was scarce space for it to stand upright and that he no longer ventured to join the weekly club of which he had been once the life and soul in short dick tinto's friends feared that he had acted like the animal called the sloth which heaving eaten up the last green leaf upon the tree where it has established itself ends by tumbling down from the top and dying of inanition i ventured to hint this to dick recommended his transferring the exercise of his inestimable talent to some other sphere and forsaking the common which he might be said to have eaten bare there is an obstacle to my change of residence said my friend grasping my hand with a look of solemnity a bill due to my landlord i am afraid replied i with heartfelt sympathy if any part of my slender means can assist in this emergence no by the soul of sir joshua answered the generous youth i will never involve a friend in the consequences of my own misfortune there is a mode by which i can regain my liberty and to creep even through a common sewer is better than to remain in prison i did not perfectly understand what my friend meant the muse of painting appeared to have failed him and what other goddess he could invoke in his distress was a mystery to me we parted however without further explanation and i did not see him until three days after when he summoned me to partake of the foy with which his landlord proposed to regale him ere his departure for edinburgh i found dick in high spirits whistling while he buckled the small knapsack which contained his colours brushes pallets and clean shirt that he parted on the best terms with mine host was obvious from the cold beef set forth in the low parlour flanked by two mugs of admirable brown stout and i own my curiosity was excited concerning the means through which the face of my friend's affairs had been so suddenly improved i did not suspect dick of dealing with the devil and by what earthly means he had extricated himself thus happily i was at a total loss to conjecture he perceived my curiosity and took me by the hand my friend he said fain would i conceal even from you the degradation to which it has been necessary to submit in order to accomplish an honourable retreat from gandercleaugh but what avails attempting to conceal that which must needs betray itself even by its superior excellence all the village all the parish all the world will soon discover to what poverty has reduced richard tinto a sudden thought here struck me i had observed that our landlord wore on that memorable morning a pair of bran new velveteens instead of his ancient thicksets what said i drawing my right hand with the forefinger and thumb pressed together nimbly from my right haunch to my left shoulder you have condescended to resume the paternal arts to which you were first bred long stitches ha dick he repelled this unlucky conjecture with a frown and a pshaw indicative of indignant contempt and leading me into another room showed me resting against the wall the majestic head of sir william wallace grim as when severed from the trunk by the orders of the edward the painting was executed on boards of a substantial thickness and the top decorated with irons for suspending the honoured effigy upon a signpost there he said my friend stands the honour of scotland and my shame yet not so rather the shame of those who instead of encouraging art in its proper sphere reduce it to these unbecoming and unworthy extremities i endeavoured to smooth the ruffled feelings of my misused and indignant friend i reminded him that he ought not like the stag in the fable to despise the quality which had extricated him from difficulties in which his talents as a portrait or landscape painter had been found unavailing above all i praised the execution as well as conception of his painting and reminded him that far from feeling dishonoured by so superb a specimen of his talents being exposed to the general view of the public he ought rather to congratulate himself upon the augmentation of his celebrity to which its public exhibition must necessarily give rise you are right my friend you are right replied poor dick his eye kindling with enthusiasm why should i shun the name of an an he hesitated for a phrase an out of doors artist hogarth has introduced himself in that character in one of his best engravings domenichino or somebody else in ancient times morland in our own have exercised their talents in this manner and wherefore limit to the rich and higher classes alone the delight which the exhibition of works of art is calculated to inspire into all classes statues are placed in the open air why should painting be more niggardly in displaying her masterpieces than her sister sculpture and yet my friend we must part suddenly the carpenter is coming in an hour to put up the the emblem and truly with all my philosophy and your consolatory encouragement to boot i would rather wish to leave gandercleugh before that operation commences we partook of our genial host's parting banquet and i escorted dick on his walk to edinburgh we parted about a mile from the village just as we heard the distant cheer of the boys which accompanied the mounting of the new symbol of the wallace head dick tinto mended his pace to get out of hearing so little had either early practice or recent philosophy reconciled him to the character of a sign painter in edinburgh dick's talents were discovered and appreciated and he received dinners and hints from several distinguished judges of the fine arts but these gentlemen dispensed their criticism more willingly than their cash and dick thought he needed cash more than criticism he therefore sought london the universal mart of talent and where as is usual in general marts of most descriptions much more of each commodity is exposed to sale than can ever find purchasers dick who in serious earnest was supposed to have considerable natural talents for his profession and whose vain and sanguine disposition never permitted him to doubt for a moment of ultimate success threw himself headlong into the crowd which jostled and struggled for notice and preferment he elbowed others and was elbowed himself and finally by dint of intrepidity fought his way into some notice painted for the prize at the institution had pictures at the exhibition at somerset house and damned the hanging committee but poor dick was doomed to lose the field he fought so gallantly in the fine arts there is scarce an alternative betwixt distinguished success and absolute failure and as dick's zeal and industry were unable to ensure the first he fell into the distresses which in his condition were the natural consequences of the latter alternative he was for a time patronised by one or two of those judicious persons who make a virtue of being singular and of pitching their own opinions against those of the world in matters of taste and criticism but they soon tired of poor tinto and laid him down as a load upon the principle on which a spoilt child throws away its plaything misery i fear took him up and accompanied him to a premature grave to which he was carried from an obscure lodging in swallow street where he had been dunned by his landlady within doors and watched by bailiffs without until death came to his relief a corner of the morning post noticed his death generously adding that his manner displayed considerable genius though his style was rather sketchy and referred to an advertisement which announced that mr varnish a well known printseller had still on hand a very few drawings and painings by richard tinto esquire which those of the nobility and gentry who might wish to complete their collections of modern art were invited to visit without delay so ended dick tinto a lamentable proof of the great truth that in the fine arts mediocrity is not permitted and that he who cannot ascend to the very top of the ladder will do well not to put his foot upon it at all the memory of tinto is dear to me from the recollection of the many conversations which we have had together most of them turning upon my present task he was delighted with my progress and talked of an ornamented and illustrated edition with heads vignettes and culs de lampe all to be designed by his own patriotic and friendly pencil he prevailed upon an old sergeant of invalids to sit to him in the character of bothwell the lifeguard's man of charles the second and the bellman of gandercleugh in that of david deans but while he thus proposed to unite his own powers with mine for the illustration of these narratives he mixed many a dose of salutary criticism with the panegyrics which my composition was at times so fortunate as to call forth your characters he said my dear pattieson make too much use of the gob box they patter too much an elegant phraseology which dick had learned while painting the scenes of an itinerant company of players there is nothing in whole pages but mere chat and dialogue the ancient philosopher said i in reply was wont to say speak that i may know thee and how is it possible for an author to introduce his personae dramatis to his readers in a more interesting and effectual manner than by the dialogue in which each is represented as supporting his own appropriate character it is a false conclusion said tinto i hate it peter as i hate an unfilled can i grant you indeed that speech is a faculty of some value in the intercourse of human affairs and i will not even insist on the doctrine of that pythagorean toper who was of opinion that over a bottle speaking spoiled conversation but i will not allow that a professor of the fine arts has occasion to embody the idea of his scene in language in order to impress upon the reader its reality and its effect on the contrary i will be judged by most of your readers peter should these tales ever become public whether you have not given us a page of talk for every single idea which two words might have communicated while the posture and manner and incident accurately drawn and brougth out by appropriate colouring would have preserved all that was worthy of preservation and saved these everlasting said he's and said she's with which it has been your pleasure to encumber your pages i replied that he confounded the operations of the pencil and the pen that the serene and silent art as painting has been called by one of our first living poets necessarily appealed to the eye because it had not the organs for addressing the ear whereas poetry or that species of composition which approached to it lay under the necessity of doing absolutely the reverse and addressed itself to the ear for the purpose of exciting that interest which it could not attain through the medium of the eye dick was not a whit staggered by my argument which he contended was founded on misrepresentation description he said was to the author of a romance exactly what drawing and tinting were to a painter words were his colours and if properly employed they could not fail to place the scene which he wished to conjure up as effectually before the mind's eye as the tablet or canvas presents it to the bodily organ the same rules he contended applied to both and an exuberance of dialogue in the former case was a verbose and laborious mode of composition which went to confound the proper art of fictitious narrative with that of the drama a widely different species of composition of which dialogue was the very essence because all excepting the language to be made use of was presented to the eye by the dresses and persons and actions of the performers upon the stage but as nothing said dick can be more dull than a long narrative written upon the plan of a drama so where you have approached most near to that species of composition by indulging in prolonged scenes of mere conversation the course of your story has become chill and constrained and you have lost the power of arresting the attention and exciting the imagination in which upon other occasions you may be considered as having succeeded tolerably well i made my bow in requital of the compliment which was probably thrown in by way of placebo and expressed myself willing at least to make one trial of a more straightforward style of composition in which my actors should do more and say less than in my former attempts of this kind dick gave me a patronising and approving nod and observed that finding me so docile he would communicate for the benefit of my muse a subject which he had studied with a view to his own art the story he said was by tradition affirmed to be truth although as upwards of a hundred years had passed away since the events took place some doubts upon the accuracy of all the particulars might be reasonably entertained when dick tinto had thus spoken he rummaged his portfolio for the sketch from which he proposed one day to execute a picture of fourteen feet by eight the sketch which was cleverly executed to use the appropriate phrase represented an ancient hall fitted up and furnished in what we now call the taste of queen elizabeth's age the light admitted from the upper part of a high casement fell upon a female figure of exquisite beauty who in an attitude of speechless terror appeared to watch the issue of a debate betwixt two other persons the one was a young man in the vandyke dress common to the time of charles i who with an air of indignant pride testified by the manner in which he raised his head and extended his arm seemed to be urging a claim of right rather than of favour to a lady whose age and some resemblance in their features pointed her out as the mother of the younger female and who appeared to listen with a mixture of displeasure and impatience tinto produced his sketch with an air of mysterious triumph and gazed on it as a fond parent looks upon a hopeful child while he anticipates the future figure he is to make in the world and the height to which he will raise the honour of his family he held it at arm's length from me he helt it closer he placed it upon the top of a chest of drawers closed the lower shutters of the casement to adjust a downward and favourable light fell back to the due distance dragging me after him shaded his face with his hand as if to exclude all but the favourite object and ended by spoiling a child's copy book which he rolled up so as to serve for the darkened tube of an amateur i fancy my expressions of enthusiasm had not been in proportion to his own for he presently exclaimed with vehemence mr pattieson i used to think you had an eye in your head i vindicated my claim to the usual allowance of visual organs yet on my honour said dick i would swear you had been born blind since you have failed at the first glance to discover the subject and meaning of that sketch i do not mean to praise my own performance i leave these arts to others i am sensible of my deficiencies conscious that my drawing and colouring may be improved by the time i intend to dedicate to the art but the conception the expression the positions these tell the story to every one who looks at the sketch and if i can finish the picture without diminution of the original conception the name of tinto shall no more be smothered by the mists of envy and intrigue i replied that i admired the sketch exceedingly but that to understand its full merit i felt it absolutely necessary to be informed of the subject that is the very thing i complain of answered tinto you have accustomed yourself so much to these creeping twilight details of yours that you are become incapable of receiving that instant and vivid flash of conviction which darts on the mind from seeing the happy and expressive combinations of a single scene and which gathers from the position attitude and countenance of the moment not only the history of the past lives of the personages represented and the nature of the business on which they are immediately engaged but lifts even the veil of futurity and affords a shrewd guess at their future fortunes in that case replied i paining excels the ape of the renowned gines de passamonte which only meddled with the past and the present nay she excels that very nature who affords her subject for i protest to you dick that were i permitted to peep into that elizabeth chamber and see the persons you have sketched conversing in flesh and blood i should not be a jot nearer guessing the nature of their business than i am at this moment while looking at your sketch only generally from the languishing look of the young lady and the care you have taken to present a very handsome leg on the part of the gentleman i presume there is some reference to a love affair between them do you really presume to form such a bold conjecture said tinto and the indignant earnestness with which you see the man urge his suit the unresisting and passive despair of the younger female the stern air of inflexible determination in the elder woman whose looks express at once consciousness that she is acting wrong and a firm determination to persist in the course she has adopted if her looks express all this my dear tinto replied i interrupting him your pencil rivals the dramatic art of mr puff in the critic who crammed a whole complicated sentence into the expressive shake of lord burleigh's head my good friend peter replied tinto i observe you are perfectly incorrigible however i have compassion on your dulness and am unwilling you should be deprived of the pleasure of understanding my picture and of gaining at the same time a subject for your own pen you must know then last summer while i was taking sketches on the coast of east lothian and berwickshire i was seduced into the mountains of lammermoor by the account i received of some remains of antiquity in that district those with which i was most struck were the ruins of an ancient castle in which that elizabeth chamber as you call it once existed i resided for two or three days at a farmhouse in the neighbourhood where the aged goodwife was well acquainted with the history of the castle and the events which had taken place in it one of these was of a nature so interesting and singular that my attention was divided between my wish to draw the old ruins in landscape and to represent in a history piece the singular events which have taken place in it here are my notes of the tale said poor dick handing a parcel of loose scraps partly scratched over with his pencil partly with his pen where outlines of caricatures sketches of turrets mills old gables and dovecots disputed the ground with his written memoranda i proceeded however to decipher the substance of the manuscript as well as i could and move it into the following tale in which following in part though not entirely my friend tinto's advice i endeavoured to render my narrative rather descriptive than dramatic my favourite propensity however has at times overcome me and my persons like many others in this talking world speak now what then a great deal more than they act chapter ii well lord we have not got that which we have tis not enough our foes are this time fled being opposites of such repairing nature henry vi part ii in the gorge of a pass or mountain glen ascending from the fertile plains of east lothian there stood in former times an extensive castle of which only the ruins are now visible its ancient proprietors were a race of powerful and warlike carons who bore the same name with the castle itself which was ravenswood their line extended to a remote period of antiquity and they had intermarried with the douglasses humes swintons hays and other families of power and distinction in the same country their history was frequently involved in that of scotland itself in whose annals their feats are recorded the castle of ravenswood occupying and in some measure commanding a pass betweixt berwickshire or the merse as the southeastern province of scotland is termed and the lothians was of importance both in times of foreign war and domestic discord it was frequently beseiged with ardour and defended with obstinacy and of course its owners played a conspicuous part in story but their house had its revolutions like all sublunary things it became greatly declined from its splendour about the middle of the 17th century and towards the period of the revolution the last proprietor of ravenswood castle saw himself compelled to part with the ancient family seat and to remove himself to a lonely and sea beaten tower which situated on the bleak shores between st abb's head and the village of eyemouth looked out on the lonely and boisterous german ocean a black domain of wild pasture land surrounded their new residence and formed the remains of their property lord ravenswood the heir of this ruined family was far from bending his mind to his new condition of life in the civil war of 1689 he had espoused the sinking side and although he had escaped without the forfeiture of life or land his blood had been attainted and his title abolished he was now called lord ravenswood only in courtesy this forfeited nobleman inherited the pride and turbulence though not the forture of his house and as he imputed the final declension of his family to a particular individual he honoured that person with his full portion of hatred this was the very man who had now become by purchase proprietor of ravenswood and the domains of which the heir of the house now stood dispossessed he was descended of a family much less ancient than that of lord ravenswood and which had only risen to wealth and political importance during the great civil wars he himself had been bred to the bar and had held high offices in the state maintaining through life the character of a skilful fisher in the troubled waters of a state divided by factions and governed by delegated authority and of one who contrived to amass considerable sums of money in a country where there was but little to be gathered and who equally knew the value of wealth and the various means of augmenting it and using it as an engine of increasing his power and influence thus qualified and gifted he was a dangerous antagonist to the fierce and imprudent ravenswood whether he had given him good cause for the enmity with which the baron regarded him was a point on which men spoke differently some said the quarrel arose merely from the vindictive spirit and envy of lord ravenswood who could not patiently behold another though by just and fair purchase become the proprietor of the estate and castle of his forefathers but the greater part of the public prone to slander the wealthy in their absence as to flatter them in their presence held a less charitable opinion they said that the lord keeper for to this height sir william ashton had ascended had previous to the final purchase of the estate of ravenswood been concerned in extensive pecuniary transactions with the former proprietor and rather intimating what was probable than affirming anything positively they asked which party was likely to have the advantage in stating and enforcing the claims arising out of these complicated affairs and more than hinted the advantages which the cool lawyer and able politician must necessarily possess over the hot fiery and imprudent character whom he had involved in legal toils and pecuniary snares the character of the times aggravated these suspicions in those days there was no king in israel since the departure of james vi to assume the richer and more powerful"
