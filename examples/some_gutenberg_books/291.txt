"1" "anywhere in the world i hope he'll die to night for then he'll go straight to heaven but the repentant selina bewailed herself with tears and sobs refusing to be comforted for that in her haste she had called this white souled relative a beast i'll tell you what we'll do said edward the master mind rising as he always did to the situation we'll christen the piebald pig after him the one that hasn't got a name yet and that'll show we're sorry for our mistake i i christened that pig this morning harold guiltily confessed i christened it after the curate i'm very sorry but he came and bow'ed to me last night after you others had all been sent to bed early and somehow i felt i had to do it oh but that doesn't count said edward hastily because we weren't all there we'll take that christening off and call it uncle william and you can save up the curate for the next litter and the motion being agreed to without a division the house went into committee of supply alarums and excursions let's pretend suggested harold that we're cavaliers and roundheads and you be a roundhead o bother i replied drowsily we pretended that yesterday and it's not my turn to be a roundhead anyhow the fact is i was lazy and the call to arms fell on indifferent ears we three younger ones were stretched at length in the orchard the sun was hot the season merry june and never i thought had there been such wealth and riot of buttercups throughout the lush grass green and gold was the dominant key that day instead of active pretence with its shouts and perspiration how much better i held to lie at ease and pretend to one's self in green and golden fancies slipping the husk and passing a careless lounger through a sleepy imaginary world all gold and green but the persistent harold was not to be fobbed of well then he began afresh let's pretend we're knights of the round table and with a rush _i'll_ be lancelot i won't play unless i'm lancelot i said i didn't mean it really but the game of knights always began with this particular contest o please implored harold you know when edward's here i never get a chance of being lancelot i haven't been lancelot for weeks then i yielded gracefully all right i said i'll be tristram o but you can't cried harold again charlotte has always been tristram she won't play unless she's allowed to be tristram be somebody else this time charlotte said nothing but breathed hard looking straight before her the peerless hunter and harper was her special hero of romance and rather than see the part in less appreciative hands she would even have returned sadly to the stuffy schoolroom i don't care i said i'll be anything i'll be sir kay come on then once more in this country's story the mail clad knights paced through the greenwood shaw questing adventure redressing wrong and bandits five to one broke and fled discomfited to their caves once again were damsels rescued dragons disembowelled and giants in every corner of the orchard deprived of their already superfluous number of heads while palamides the saracen waited for us by the well and sir breuse saunce pite vanished in craven flight before the skilled spear that was his terror and his bane once more the lists were dight in camelot and all was gay with shimmer of silk and gold the earth shook with thunder of horses ash staves flew in splinters and the firmament rang to the clash of sword on helm the varying fortune of the day swung doubtful now on this side now on that till at last lancelot grim and great thrusting through the press unhorsed sir tristram an easy task and bestrode her threatening doom while the cornish knight forgetting hard won fame of old cried piteously you're hurting me i tell you and you're tearing my frock then it happed that sir kay hurtling to the rescue stopped short in his stride catching sight suddenly through apple boughs of a gleam of scarlet afar off while the confused tramp of many horses mingled with talk and laughter was borne to our ears what is it inquired tristram sitting up and shaking out her curls while lancelot forsook the clanging lists and trotted nimbly to the hedge i stood spell bound for a moment longer and then with a cry of soldiers i was off to the hedge charlotte picking herself up and scurrying after down the road they came two and two at an easy walk scarlet flamed in the eye bits jingled and saddles squeaked delightfully while the men in a halo of dust smoked their short clays like the heroes they were in a swirl of intoxicating glory the troop clinked and clattered by while we shouted and waved jumping up and down and the big jolly horsemen acknowledged the salute with easy condescension the moment they were past we were through the hedge and after them soldiers were not the common stuff of everyday life there had been nothing like this since the winter before last when on a certain afternoon bare of leaf and monochrome in its hue of sodden fallow and frost nipt copse suddenly the hounds had burst through the fence with their mellow cry and all the paddock was for the minute reverberant of thudding hoof and dotted with glancing red but this was better since it could only mean that blows and bloodshed were in the air is there going to be a battle panted harold hardly able to keep up for excitement of course there is i replied we're just in time come on perhaps i ought to have known better and yet the pigs and poultry with whom we chiefly consorted could instruct us little concerning the peace that in these latter days lapped this sea girt realm in the schoolroom we were just now dallying with the wars of the roses and did not legends of the country side inform us how cavaliers had once galloped up and down these very lanes from their quarters in the village here now were soldiers unmistakable and if their business was not fighting what was it sniffing the joy of battle we followed hard on their tracks won't edward be sorry puffed harold that he's begun that beastly latin it did indeed seem hard edward the most martial spirit of us all was drearily conjugating amo of all verbs between four walls while selina who ever thrilled ecstatic to a red coat was struggling with the uncouth german tongue age i reflected carries its penalties it was a grievous disappointment to us that the troop passed through the village unmolested every cottage i pointed out to my companions ought to have been loopholed and strongly held but no opposition was offered to the soldiers who indeed conducted themselves with a recklessness and a want of precaution that seemed simply criminal at the last cottage a transitory gleam of common sense flickered across me and turning on charlotte i sternly ordered her back the small maiden docile but exceedingly dolorous dragged reluctant feet homewards heavy at heart that she was to behold no stout fellows slain that day but harold and i held steadily on expecting every instant to see the environing hedges crackle and spit forth the leaden death will they be indians inquired my brother meaning the enemy or roundheads or what i reflected harold always required direct straightforward answers not faltering suppositions they won't be indians i replied at last nor yet roundheads there haven't been any roundheads seen about here for a long time they'll be frenchmen harold's face fell all right he said frenchmen'll do but i did hope they'd be indians if they were going to be indians i explained i i don't think i'd go on because when indians take you prisoner they scalp you first and then burn you at a stake but frenchmen don't do that sort of thing are you quite sure asked harold doubtfully quite i replied frenchmen only shut you up in a thing called the bastille and then you get a file sent in to you in a loaf of bread and saw the bars through and slide down a rope and they all fire at you but they don't hit you and you run down to the seashore as hard as you can and swim off to a british frigate and there you are harold brightened up again the programme was rather attractive if they try to take us prisoner he said we we won't run will we meanwhile the craven foe was a long time showing himself and we were reaching strange outland country uncivilised wherein lions might be expected to prowl at nightfall i had a stitch in my side and both harold's stockings had come down just as i was beginning to have gloomy doubts of the proverbial courage of frenchmen the officer called out something the men closed up and breaking into a trot the troops already far ahead vanished out of our sight with a sinking at the heart i began to suspect we had been fooled are they charging cried harold weary but rallying gamely i think not i replied doubtfully when there's going to be a charge the officer always makes a speech and then they draw their swords and the trumpets blow and but let's try a short cut we may catch them up yet so we struck across the fields and into another road and pounded down that and then over more fields panting down hearted yet hoping for the best the sun went in and a thin drizzle began to fall we were muddy breathless almost dead beat but we blundered on till at last we struck a road more brutally more callously unfamiliar than any road i ever looked upon not a hint nor a sign of friendly direction or assistance on the dogged white face of it there was no longer any disguising it we were hopelessly lost the small rain continued steadily the evening began to come on really there are moments when a fellow is justified in crying and i would have cried too if harold had not been there that right minded child regarded an elder brother as a veritable god and i could see that he felt himself as secure as if a whole brigade of guards hedged him round with protecting bayonets but i dreaded sore lest he should begin again with his questions as i gazed in dumb appeal on the face of unresponsive nature the sound of nearing wheels sent a pulse of hope through my being increasing to rapture as i recognised in the approaching vehicle the familiar carriage of the old doctor if ever a god emerged from a machine it was when this heaven sent friend recognising us stopped and jumped out with a cheery hail harold rushed up to him at once have you been there he cried was it a jolly fight who beat were there many people killed the doctor appeared puzzled i briefly explained the situation i see said the doctor looking grave and twisting his face this way and that well the fact is there isn't going to be any battle to day it's been put off on account of the change in the weather you will have due notice of the renewal of hostilities and now you'd better jump in and i'll drive you home you've been running a fine rig why you might have both been taken and shot as spies this special danger had never even occurred to us the thrill of it accentuated the cosey homelike feeling of the cushions we nestled into as we rolled homewards the doctor beguiled the journey with blood curdling narratives of personal adventure in the tented field he having followed the profession of arms so it seemed in every quarter of the globe time the destroyer of all things beautiful subsequently revealed the baselessness of these legends but what of that there are higher things than truth and we were almost reconciled by the time we were dropped at our gate to the fact that the battle had been postponed the finding of the princess it was the day i was promoted to a tooth brush the girls irrespective of age had been thus distinguished some time before why we boys could never rightly understand except that it was part and parcel of a system of studied favouritism on behalf of creatures both physically inferior and as was shown by a fondness for tale bearing of weaker mental fibre it was not that we yearned after these strange instruments in themselves edward indeed applied his to the scrubbing out of his squirrel's cage and for personal use when a superior eye was grim on him borrowed harold's or mine indifferently but the nimbus of distinction that clung to them that we coveted exceedingly what more indeed was there to ascend to before the remote but still possible razor and strop perhaps the exaltation had mounted to my head or nature and the perfect morning joined to him at disaffection anyhow having breakfasted and triumphantly repeated the collect i had broken down in the last sunday twas one without rhythm or alliteration a most objectionable collect having achieved thus much the small natural man in me rebelled and i vowed as i straddled and spat about the stable yard in feeble imitation of the coachman that lessons might go to the inventor of them it was only geography that morning any way and the practical thing was worth any quantity of bookish theoretic as for me i was going on my travels and imports and exports populations and capitals might very well wait while i explored the breathing coloured world outside true a fellow rebel was wanted and harold might as a rule have been counted on with certainty but just then harold was very proud the week before he had gone into tables and had been endowed with a new slate having a miniature sponge attached wherewith we washed the faces of charlotte's dolls thereby producing an unhealthy pallor which struck terror into the child's heart always timorous regarding epidemic visitations as to tables nobody knew exactly what they were least of all harold but it was a step over the heads of the rest and therefore a subject for self adulation and generally speaking airs so that harold hugging his slate and his chains was out of the question now in such a matter girls were worse than useless as wanting the necessary tenacity of will and contempt for self constituted authority so eventually i slipped through the hedge a solitary protestant and issued forth on the lane what time the rest of the civilised world was sitting down to lessons the scene was familiar enough and yet this morning how different it all seemed the act with its daring tinted everything with new strange hues affecting the individual with a sort of bruised feeling just below the pit of the stomach that was intensified whenever his thoughts flew back to the ink stained smelly schoolroom and could this be really me or was i only contemplating from the schoolroom aforesaid some other jolly young mutineer faring forth under the genial sun anyhow here was the friendly well in its old place half way up the lane hither the yoke shouldering village folk were wont to come to fill their clinking buckets when the drippings made worms of wet in the thick dust of the road they had flat wooden crosses inside each pail which floated on the top and we were instructed served to prevent the water from slopping over we used to wonder by what magic this strange principle worked and who first invented the crosses and whether he got a peerage for it but indeed the well was a centre of mystery for a hornet's nest was somewhere hard by and the very thought was fearsome wasps we knew well and disdained storming them in their fastnesses but these great beasts vestured in angry orange three stings from which so t was averred would kill a horse these were of a different kidney and their warning drone suggested prudence and retreat at this time neither villagers nor hornets encroached on the stillness lessons apparently pervaded all nature so after dabbling awhile in the well what boy has ever passed a bit of water without messing in it i scrambled through the hedge avoiding the hornet haunted side and struck into the silence of the copse if the lane had been deserted this was loneliness become personal here mystery lurked and peeped here brambles caught and held with a purpose of their own and saplings whipped the face with human spite the copse too proved vaster in extent more direfully drawn out than one would ever have guessed from its frontage on the lane and i was really glad when at last the wood opened and sloped down to a streamlet brawling forth into the sunlight by this cheery companion i wandered along conscious of little but that nature in providing store of water rats had thoughtfully furnished provender of right sized stones rapids also there were telling of canoes and portages crinkling bays and inlets caves for pirates and hidden treasures the wise dame had forgotten nothing till at last after what lapse of time i know not my further course though not the stream's was barred by some six feet of stout wire netting stretched from side to side just where a thick hedge arching till it touched forbade all further view the excitement of the thing was becoming thrilling a black flag must surely be fluttering close by here was evidently a malignant contrivance of the pirates designed to baffle our gun boats when we dashed up stream to shell them from their lair a gun boat indeed might well have hesitated so stout was the netting so close the hedge but i spied where a rabbit was wont to pass close down by the water's edge where a rabbit could go a boy could follow albeit stomach wise and with one leg in the stream so the passage was achieved and i stood inside safe but breathless at the sight gone was the brambled waste gone the flickering tangle of woodland instead terrace after terrace of shaven sward stone edged urn cornered stepped delicately down to where the stream now tamed and educated passed from one to another marble basin in which on occasion gleams of red hinted at gold fish in among the spreading water lilies the scene lay silent and slumbrous in the brooding noonday sun the drowsing peacock squatted humped on the lawn no fish leapt in the pools nor bird declared himself from the environing hedges self confessed it was here then at last the garden of sleep two things in those old days i held in especial distrust gamekeepers and gardeners seeing however no baleful apparitions of either nature i pursued my way between rich flower beds in search of the necessary princess conditions declared her presence patently as trumpets without this centre such surroundings could not exist a pavilion gold topped wreathed with lush jessamine beckoned with a special significance over close set shrubs there if anywhere she should be enshrined instinct and some knowledge of the habits of princesses triumphed for indeed there she was in no tranced repose however but laughingly struggling to disengage her hand from the grasp of a grown up man who occupied the marble bench with her as to age i suppose now that the two swung in respective scales that pivoted on twenty but children heed no minor distinctions to them the inhabited world is composed of the two main divisions children and upgrown people the latter being in no way superior to the former only hopelessly different these two then belonged to the grown up section i paused thinking it strange they should prefer seclusion when there were fish to be caught and butterflies to hunt in the sun outside and as i cogitated thus the grown up man caught sight of me hallo sprat he said with some abruptness where do you spring from i came up the stream i explained politely and comprehensively and i was only looking for the princess then you are a water baby he replied and what do you think of the princess now you've found her i think she is lovely i said and doubtless i was right having never learned to flatter but she's wide awake so i suppose somebody has kissed her this very natural deduction moved the grown up man to laughter but the princess turning red and jumping up declared that it was time for lunch come along then said the grown up man and you too water baby come and have something solid you must want it i accompanied them without any feeling of false delicacy the world as known to me was spread with food each several mid day and the particular table one sat at seemed a matter of no importance the palace was very sumptuous and beautiful just what a palace ought to be and we were met by a stately lady rather more grownup than the princess apparently her mother my friend the man was very kind and introduced me as the captain saying i had just run down from aldershot i didn't know where aldershot was but had no manner of doubt that he was perfectly right as a rule indeed grown up people are fairly correct on matters of fact it is in the higher gift of imagination that they are so sadly to seek the lunch was excellent and varied another gentleman in beautiful clothes a lord presumably lifted me into a high carved chair and stood behind it brooding over me like a providence i endeavoured to explain who i was and where i had come from and to impress the company with my own tooth brush and harold's tables but either they were stupid or is it a characteristic of fairyland that every one laughs at the most ordinary remarks my friend the man said good naturedly all right water baby you came up the stream and that's good enough for us the lord a reserved sort of man i thought took no share in the conversation after lunch i walked on the terrace with the princess and my friend the man and was very proud and i told him what i was going to be and he told me what he was going to be and then i remarked i suppose you two are going to get married he only laughed after the fairy fashion because if you aren't i added you really ought to meaning only that a man who discovered a princess living in the right sort of palace like this and didn't marry her there and then was false to all recognised tradition they laughed again and my friend suggested i should go down to the pond and look at the gold fish while they went for a stroll i was sleepy and assented but before they left me the grown up man put two half crowns in my hand for the purpose he explained of treating the other water babies i was so touched by this crowning mark of friendship that i nearly cried and thought much more of his generosity than of the fact that the princess ere she moved away stooped down and kissed me i watched them disappear down the path how naturally arms seem to go round waists in fairyland and then my cheek on the cool marble lulled by the trickle of water i slipped into dreamland out of real and magic world alike when i woke the sun had gone in a chill wind set all the leaves a whispering and the peacock on the lawn was harshly calling up the rain a wild unreasoning panic possessed me and i sped out of the garden like a guilty thing wriggled through the rabbit run and threaded my doubtful way homewards hounded by nameless terrors the half crowns happily remained solid and real to the touch but could i hope to bear such treasure safely through the brigand haunted wood it was a dirty weary little object that entered its home at nightfall by the unassuming aid of the scullery window and only to be sent tealess to bed seemed infinite mercy to him officially tealess that is for as was usual after such escapades a sympathetic housemaid coming delicately by backstairs stayed him with chunks of cold pudding and condolence till his small skin was tight as any drum then nature asserting herself i passed into the comforting kingdom of sleep where a golden carp of fattest build i oared it in translucent waters with a new half crown snug under right fin and left and thrust up a nose through water lily leaves to be kissed by a rose flushed princess sawdust and sin a belt of rhododendrons grew close down to one side of our pond and along the edge of it many things flourished rankly if you crept through the undergrowth and crouched by the water's rim it was easy if your imagination were in healthy working order to transport yourself in a trice to the heart of a tropical forest overhead the monkeys chattered parrots flashed from bough to bough strange large blossoms shone around you and the push and rustle of great beasts moving unseen thrilled you deliciously and if you lay down with your nose an inch or two from the water it was not long ere the old sense of proportion vanished clean away the glittering insects that darted to and fro on its surface became sea monsters dire the gnats that hung above them swelled to albatrosses and the pond itself stretched out into a vast inland sea whereon a navy might ride secure and whence at any moment the hairy scalp of a sea serpent might be seen to emerge it is impossible however to play at tropical forests properly when homely accents of the human voice intrude and all my hopes of seeing a tiger seized by a crocodile while drinking vide picture books passim vanished abruptly and earth resumed her old dimensions when the sound of charlotte's prattle somewhere hard by broke in on my primeval seclusion looking out from the bushes i saw her trotting towards an open space of lawn the other side the pond chattering to herself in her accustomed fashion a doll tucked under either arm and her brow knit with care propping up her double burden against a friendly stump she sat down in front of them as full of worry and anxiety as a chancellor on a budget night her victims who stared resignedly in front of them were recognisable as jerry and rosa jerry hailed from far japan his hair was straight and black his one garment cotton of a simple blue and his reputation was distinctly bad jerome was his proper name from his supposed likeness to the holy man who hung in a print on the staircase though a shaven crown was the only thing in common twixt western saint and eastern sinner rosa was typical british from her flaxen poll to the stout calves she displayed so liberally and in character she was of the blameless order of those who have not yet been found out i suspected jerry from the first there was a latent devilry in his slant eyes as he sat there moodily and knowing what he was capable of i scented trouble in store for charlotte rosa i was not so sure about she sat demurely and upright and looked far away into the tree tops in a visionary world forgetting sort of way yet the prim purse of her mouth was somewhat overdone and her eyes glittered unnaturally now i'm going to begin where i left off said charlotte regardless of stops and thumping the turf with her fist excitedly and you must pay attention cos this is a treat to have a story told you before you're put to bed well so the white rabbit scuttled off down the passage and alice hoped he'd come back cos he had a waistcoat on and her flamingo flew up a tree but we haven't got to that part yet you must wait a minute and where had i got to jerry only remained passive until charlotte had got well under way and then began to heel over quietly in rosa's direction his head fell on her plump shoulder causing her to start nervously charlotte seized and shook him with vigour o jerry she cried piteously if you're not going to be good how ever shall i tell you my story jerry's face was injured innocence itself blame if you like madam he seemed to say the eternal laws of gravitation but not a helpless puppet who is also an orphan and a stranger in the land now we'll go on began charlotte once more so she got into the garden at last i've left out a lot but you won't care i'll tell you some other time and they were all playing croquet and that's where the flamingo comes in and the queen shouted out off with her head at this point jerry collapsed forward suddenly and completely his bald pate between his knees charlotte was not very angry this time the"
