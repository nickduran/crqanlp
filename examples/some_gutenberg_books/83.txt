"1" "of that mysterious orb and some even seemed to fear lest its conquest should not sensibly derange the equilibrium of europe the project once under discussion not a single paragraph suggested a doubt of its realization all the papers pamphlets reports all the journals published by the scientific literary and religious societies enlarged upon its advantages and the society of natural history of boston the society of science and art of albany the geographical and statistical society of new york the philosophical society of philadelphia and the smithsonian of washington sent innumerable letters of congratulation to the gun club together with offers of immediate assistance and money from that day forward impey barbicane became one of the greatest citizens of the united states a kind of washington of science a single trait of feeling taken from many others will serve to show the point which this homage of a whole people to a single individual attained some few days after this memorable meeting of the gun club the manager of an english company announced at the baltimore theatre the production of much ado about nothing but the populace seeing in that title an allusion damaging to barbicane's project broke into the auditorium smashed the benches and compelled the unlucky director to alter his playbill being a sensible man he bowed to the public will and replaced the offending comedy by as you like it and for many weeks he realized fabulous profits chapter iv reply from the observatory of cambridge barbicane however lost not one moment amid all the enthusiasm of which he had become the object his first care was to reassemble his colleagues in the board room of the gun club there after some discussion it was agreed to consult the astronomers regarding the astronomical part of the enterprise their reply once ascertained they could then discuss the mechanical means and nothing should be wanting to ensure the success of this great experiment a note couched in precise terms containing special interrogatories was then drawn up and addressed to the observatory of cambridge in massachusetts this city where the first university of the united states was founded is justly celebrated for its astronomical staff there are to be found assembled all the most eminent men of science here is to be seen at work that powerful telescope which enabled bond to resolve the nebula of andromeda and clarke to discover the satellite of sirius this celebrated institution fully justified on all points the confidence reposed in it by the gun club so after two days the reply so impatiently awaited was placed in the hands of president barbicane it was couched in the following terms _the director of the cambridge observatory to the president of the gun club at baltimore cambridge october 7 on the receipt of your favor of the 6th instant addressed to the observatory of cambridge in the name of the members of the baltimore gun club our staff was immediately called together and it was judged expedient to reply as follows the questions which have been proposed to it are these 1 is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon 2 what is the exact distance which separates the earth from its satellite 3 what will be the period of transit of the projectile when endowed with sufficient initial velocity and consequently at what moment ought it to be discharged in order that it may touch the moon at a particular point 4 at what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most favorable position to be reached by the projectile 5 what point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed at which is intended to discharge the projectile 6 what place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the projectile's departure regarding the _first_ question is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon _answer yes provided it possess an initial velocity of 1,200 yards per second calculations prove that to be sufficient in proportion as we recede from the earth the action of gravitation diminishes in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance that is to say _at three times a given distance the action is nine times less consequently the weight of a shot will decrease and will become reduced to _zero_ at the instant that the attraction of the moon exactly counterpoises that of the earth that is to say at 47 52 of its passage at that instant the projectile will have no weight whatever and if it passes that point it will fall into the moon by the sole effect of the lunar attraction the _theoretical possibility_ of the experiment is therefore absolutely demonstrated its _success_ must depend upon the power of the engine employed as to the _second_ question what is the exact distance which separates the earth from its satellite _answer the moon does not describe a _circle_ round the earth but rather an _ellipse_ of which our earth occupies one of the _foci_ the consequence therefore is that at certain times it approaches nearer to and at others it recedes farther from the earth in astronomical language it is at one time in _apogee_ at another in _perigee_ now the difference between its greatest and its least distance is too considerable to be left out of consideration in point of fact in its apogee the moon is 247,552 miles and in its perigee 218,657 miles only distant a fact which makes a difference of 28,895 miles or more than one ninth of the entire distance the perigee distance therefore is that which ought to serve as the basis of all calculations to the _third_ question _answer if the shot should preserve continuously its initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second it would require little more than nine hours to reach its destination but inasmuch as that initial velocity will be continually decreasing it will occupy 300,000 seconds that is 83hrs 20m in reaching the point where the attraction of the earth and moon will be _in equilibrio_ from this point it will fall into the moon in 50,000 seconds or 13hrs 53m 20sec it will be desirable therefore to discharge it 97hrs 13m 20sec before the arrival of the moon at the point aimed at regarding question _four_ at what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most favorable position etc _answer after what has been said above it will be necessary first of all to choose the period when the moon will be in perigee and _also_ the moment when she will be crossing the zenith which latter event will further diminish the entire distance by a length equal to the radius of the earth _i e 3,919 miles the result of which will be that the final passage remaining to be accomplished will be 214,976 miles but although the moon passes her perigee every month she does not reach the zenith always _at exactly the same moment_ she does not appear under these two conditions simultaneously except at long intervals of time it will be necessary therefore to wait for the moment when her passage in perigee shall coincide with that in the zenith now by a fortunate circumstance on the 4th of december in the ensuing year the moon _will_ present these two conditions at midnight she will be in perigee that is at her shortest distance from the earth and at the same moment she will be crossing the zenith on the _fifth_ question at what point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed _answer the preceding remarks being admitted the cannon ought to be pointed to the zenith of the place its fire therefore will be perpendicular to the plane of the horizon and the projectile will soonest pass beyond the range of the terrestrial attraction but in order that the moon should reach the zenith of a given place it is necessary that the place should not exceed in latitude the declination of the luminary in other words it must be comprised within the degrees 0 and 28 of lat n or s in every other spot the fire must necessarily be oblique which would seriously militate against the success of the experiment as to the _sixth_ question what place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the projectile's departure _answer at the moment when the projectile shall be discharged into space the moon which travels daily forward 13 10 35 will be distant from the zenith point by four times that quantity _i e by 52 41 20 a space which corresponds to the path which she will describe during the entire journey of the projectile but inasmuch as it is equally necessary to take into account the deviation which the rotary motion of the earth will impart to the shot and as the shot cannot reach the moon until after a deviation equal to 16 radii of the earth which calculated upon the moon's orbit are equal to about eleven degrees it becomes necessary to add these eleven degrees to those which express the retardation of the moon just mentioned that is to say in round numbers about sixty four degrees consequently at the moment of firing the visual radius applied to the moon will describe with the vertical line of the place an angle of sixty four degrees these are our answers to the questions proposed to the observatory of cambridge by the members of the gun club to sum up 1st the cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between 0 and 28 of n or s lat 2nd it ought to be pointed directly toward the zenith of the place 3rd the projectile ought to be propelled with an initial velocity of 12,000 yards per second 4th it ought to be discharged at 10hrs 46m 40sec of the 1st of december of the ensuing year 5th it will meet the moon four days after its discharge precisely at midnight on the 4th of december at the moment of its transit across the zenith the members of the gun club ought therefore without delay to commence the works necessary for such an experiment and to be prepared to set to work at the moment determined upon for if they should suffer this 4th of december to go by they will not find the moon again under the same conditions of perigee and of zenith until eighteen years and eleven days afterward the staff of the cambridge observatory place themselves entirely at their disposal in respect of all questions of theoretical astronomy and herewith add their congratulations to those of all the rest of america for the astronomical staff j m belfast _director of the observatory of cambridge chapter v the romance of the moon an observer endued with an infinite range of vision and placed in that unknown center around which the entire world revolves might have beheld myriads of atoms filling all space during the chaotic epoch of the universe little by little as ages went on a change took place a general law of attraction manifested itself to which the hitherto errant atoms became obedient these atoms combined together chemically according to their affinities formed themselves into molecules and composed those nebulous masses with which the depths of the heavens are strewed these masses became immediately endued with a rotary motion around their own central point this center formed of indefinite molecules began to revolve around its own axis during its gradual condensation then following the immutable laws of mechanics in proportion as its bulk diminished by condensation its rotary motion became accelerated and these two effects continuing the result was the formation of one principal star the center of the nebulous mass by attentively watching the observer would then have perceived the other molecules of the mass following the example of this central star become likewise condensed by gradually accelerated rotation and gravitating round it in the shape of innumerable stars thus was formed the _nebulae_ of which astronomers have reckoned up nearly 5,000 among these 5,000 nebulae there is one which has received the name of the milky way and which contains eighteen millions of stars each of which has become the center of a solar world if the observer had then specially directed his attention to one of the more humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies a star of the fourth class that which is arrogantly called the sun all the phenomena to which the formation of the universe is to be ascribed would have been successively fulfilled before his eyes in fact he would have perceived this sun as yet in the gaseous state and composed of moving molecules revolving round its axis in order to accomplish its work of concentration this motion faithful to the laws of mechanics would have been accelerated with the diminution of its volume and a moment would have arrived when the centrifugal force would have overpowered the centripetal which causes the molecules all to tend toward the center another phenomenon would now have passed before the observer's eye and the molecules situated on the plane of the equator escaping like a stone from a sling of which the cord had suddenly snapped would have formed around the sun sundry concentric rings resembling that of saturn in their turn again these rings of cosmical matter excited by a rotary motion about the central mass would have been broken up and decomposed into secondary nebulosities that is to say into planets similarly he would have observed these planets throw off one or more rings each which became the origin of the secondary bodies which we call satellites thus then advancing from atom to molecule from molecule to nebulous mass from that to principal star from star to sun from sun to planet and hence to satellite we have the whole series of transformations undergone by the heavenly bodies during the first days of the world now of those attendant bodies which the sun maintains in their elliptical orbits by the great law of gravitation some few in turn possess satellites uranus has eight saturn eight jupiter four neptune possibly three and the earth one this last one of the least important of the entire solar system we call the moon and it is she whom the daring genius of the americans professed their intention of conquering the moon by her comparative proximity and the constantly varying appearances produced by her several phases has always occupied a considerable share of the attention of the inhabitants of the earth from the time of thales of miletus in the fifth century b.c down to that of copernicus in the fifteenth and tycho brahe in the sixteenth century a.d observations have been from time to time carried on with more or less correctness until in the present day the altitudes of the lunar mountains have been determined with exactitude galileo explained the phenomena of the lunar light produced during certain of her phases by the existence of mountains to which he assigned a mean altitude of 27,000 feet after him hevelius an astronomer of dantzic reduced the highest elevations to 15,000 feet but the calculations of riccioli brought them up again to 21,000 feet at the close of the eighteenth century herschel armed with a powerful telescope considerably reduced the preceding measurements he assigned a height of 11,400 feet to the maximum elevations and reduced the mean of the different altitudes to little more than 2,400 feet but herschel's calculations were in their turn corrected by the observations of halley nasmyth bianchini gruithuysen and others but it was reserved for the labors of boeer and maedler finally to solve the question they succeeded in measuring 1,905 different elevations of which six exceed 15,000 feet and twenty two exceed 14,400 feet the highest summit of all towers to a height of 22,606 feet above the surface of the lunar disc at the same period the examination of the moon was completed she appeared completely riddled with craters and her essentially volcanic character was apparent at each observation by the absence of refraction in the rays of the planets occulted by her we conclude that she is absolutely devoid of an atmosphere the absence of air entails the absence of water it became therefore manifest that the selenites to support life under such conditions must possess a special organization of their own must differ remarkably from the inhabitants of the earth at length thanks to modern art instruments of still higher perfection searched the moon without intermission not leaving a single point of her surface unexplored and notwithstanding that her diameter measures 2,150 miles her surface equals the one fifteenth part of that of our globe and her bulk the one forty ninth part of that of the terrestrial spheroid not one of her secrets was able to escape the eyes of the astronomers and these skillful men of science carried to an even greater degree their prodigious observations thus they remarked that during full moon the disc appeared scored in certain parts with white lines and during the phases with black on prosecuting the study of these with still greater precision they succeeded in obtaining an exact account of the nature of these lines they were long and narrow furrows sunk between parallel ridges bordering generally upon the edges of the craters their length varied between ten and 100 miles and their width was about 1,600 yards astronomers called them chasms but they could not get any further whether these chasms were the dried up beds of ancient rivers or not they were unable thoroughly to ascertain the americans among others hoped one day or other to determine this geological question they also undertook to examine the true nature of that system of parallel ramparts discovered on the moon's surface by gruithuysen a learned professor of munich who considered them to be a system of fortifications thrown up by the selenitic engineers these two points yet obscure as well as others no doubt could not be definitely settled except by direct communication with the moon regarding the degree of intensity of its light there was nothing more to learn on this point it was known that it is 300,000 times weaker than that of the sun and that its heat has no appreciable effect upon the thermometer as to the phenomenon known as the ashy light it is explained naturally by the effect of the transmission of the solar rays from the earth to the moon which give the appearance of completeness to the lunar disc while it presents itself under the crescent form during its first and last phases such was the state of knowledge acquired regarding the earth's satellite which the gun club undertook to perfect in all its aspects cosmographic geological political and moral chapter vi permissive limits of ignorance and belief in the united states the immediate result of barbicane's proposition was to place upon the orders of the day all the astronomical facts relative to the queen of the night everybody set to work to study assiduously one would have thought that the moon had just appeared for the first time and that no one had ever before caught a glimpse of her in the heavens the papers revived all the old anecdotes in which the sun of the wolves played a part they recalled the influences which the ignorance of past ages ascribed to her in short all america was seized with selenomania or had become moon mad the scientific journals for their part dealt more especially with the questions which touched upon the enterprise of the gun club the letter of the observatory of cambridge was published by them and commented upon with unreserved approval until that time most people had been ignorant of the mode in which the distance which separates the moon from the earth is calculated they took advantage of this fact to explain to them that this distance was obtained by measuring the parallax of the moon the term parallax proving caviare to the general they further explained that it meant the angle formed by the inclination of two straight lines drawn from either extremity of the earth's radius to the moon on doubts being expressed as to the correctness of this method they immediately proved that not only was the mean distance 234,347 miles but that astronomers could not possibly be in error in their estimate by more than seventy miles either way to those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon they demonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions the first being that of rotation upon her axis the second being that of revolution round the earth accomplishing both together in an equal period of time that is to say in twenty seven and one third days the motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on the surface of the moon save that there is only one day and one night in the lunar month each lasting three hundred and fifty four and one third hours but happily for her the face turned toward the terrestrial globe is illuminated by it with an intensity equal to that of fourteen moons as to the other face always invisible to us it has of necessity three hundred and fifty four hours of absolute night tempered only by that pale glimmer which falls upon it from the stars some well intentioned but rather obstinate persons could not at first comprehend how if the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth during her revolution she can describe one turn round herself to such they answered go into your dining room and walk round the table in such a way as to always keep your face turned toward the center by the time you will have achieved one complete round you will have completed one turn around yourself since your eye will have traversed successively every point of the room well then the room is the heavens the table is the earth and the moon is yourself and they would go away delighted so then the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth nevertheless to be quite exact it is necessary to add that in consequence of certain fluctuations of north and south and of west and east termed her libration she permits rather more than half that is to say five sevenths to be seen as soon as the ignoramuses came to understand as much as the director of the observatory himself knew they began to worry themselves regarding her revolution round the earth whereupon twenty scientific reviews immediately came to the rescue they pointed out to them that the firmament with its infinitude of stars may be considered as one vast dial plate upon which the moon travels indicating the true time to all the inhabitants of the earth that it is during this movement that the queen of night exhibits her different phases that the moon is _full_ when she is in _opposition_ with the sun that is when the three bodies are on the same straight line the earth occupying the center that she is _new_ when she is in _conjunction_ with the sun that is when she is between it and the earth and lastly that she is in her _first_ or _last_ quarter when she makes with the sun and the earth an angle of which she herself occupies the apex regarding the altitude which the moon attains above the horizon the letter of the cambridge observatory had said all that was to be said in this respect every one knew that this altitude varies according to the latitude of the observer but the only zones of the globe in which the moon passes the zenith that is the point directly over the head of the spectator are of necessity comprised between the twenty eighth parallels and the equator hence the importance of the advice to try the experiment upon some point of that part of the globe in order that the projectile might be discharged perpendicularly and so the soonest escape the action of gravitation this was an essential condition to the success of the enterprise and continued actively to engage the public attention regarding the path described by the moon in her revolution round the earth the cambridge observatory had demonstrated that this path is a re entering curve not a perfect circle but an ellipse of which the earth occupies one of the _foci_ it was also well understood that it is farthest removed from the earth during its _apogee_ and approaches most nearly to it at its _perigee_ such was then the extent of knowledge possessed by every american on the subject and of which no one could decently profess ignorance still while these principles were being rapidly disseminated many errors and illusory fears proved less easy to eradicate for instance some worthy persons maintained that the moon was an ancient comet which in describing its elongated orbit round the sun happened to pass near the earth and became confined within her circle of attraction these drawing room astronomers professed to explain the charred aspect of the moon a disaster which they attributed to the intensity of the solar heat only on being reminded that comets have an atmosphere and that the moon has little or none they were fairly at a loss for a reply others again belonging to the doubting class expressed certain fears as to the position of the moon they had heard it said that according to observations made in the time of the caliphs her revolution had become accelerated in a certain degree hence they concluded logically enough that an acceleration of motion ought to be accompanied by a corresponding diminution in the distance separating the two bodies and that supposing the double effect to be continued to infinity the moon would end by one day falling into the earth however they became reassured as to the fate of future generations on being apprised that according to the calculations of laplace this acceleration of motion is confined within very restricted limits and that a proportional diminution of speed will be certain to succeed it so then the stability of the solar system would not be deranged in ages to come there remains but the third class the superstitious these worthies were not content merely to rest in ignorance they must know all about things which had no existence whatever and as to the moon they had long known all about her one set regarded her disc as a polished mirror by means of which people could see each other from different points of the earth and interchange their thoughts another set pretended that out of one thousand new moons that had been observed nine hundred and fifty had been attended with remarkable disturbances such as cataclysms revolutions earthquakes the deluge etc then they believed in some mysterious influence exercised by her over human destinies that every selenite was attached to some inhabitant of the earth by a tie of sympathy they maintained that the entire vital system is subject to her control etc but in time the majority renounced these vulgar errors and espoused the true side of the question as for the yankees they had no other ambition than to take possession of this new continent of the sky and to plant upon the summit of its highest elevation the star spangled banner of the united states of america chapter vii the hymn of the cannon ball the observatory of cambridge in its memorable letter had treated the question from a purely astronomical point of view the mechanical part still remained president barbicane had without loss of time nominated a working committee of the gun club the duty of this committee was to resolve the three grand questions of the cannon the projectile and the powder it was composed of four members of great technical knowledge barbicane with a casting vote in case of equality general morgan major elphinstone and j t maston to whom were confided the functions of secretary on the 8th of october the committee met at the house of president barbicane 3 republican street the meeting was opened by the president himself gentlemen said he we have to resolve one of the most important problems in the whole of the noble science of gunnery it might appear perhaps the most logical course to devote our first meeting to the discussion of the engine to be employed nevertheless after mature consideration it has appeared to me that the question of the projectile must take precedence of that of the cannon and that the dimensions of the latter must necessarily depend on those of the former suffer me to say a word here broke in j t maston permission having been granted gentlemen said he with an inspired accent our president is right in placing the question of the projectile above all others the ball we are about to discharge at the moon is our ambassador to her and i wish to consider it from a moral point of view the cannon ball gentlemen to my mind is the most magnificent manifestation of human power if providence has created the stars and the planets man has called the cannon ball into existence let providence claim the swiftness of electricity and of light of the stars the comets and the planets of wind and sound we claim to have invented the swiftness of the cannon ball a hundred times superior to that of the swiftest horses or railway train how glorious will be the moment when infinitely exceeding all hitherto attained velocities we shall launch our new projectile with the rapidity of seven miles a second shall it not"
