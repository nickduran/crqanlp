"1" "me power at last i go but i shall return and the son of tarzan skipped across the room slipped through the open window and slid to liberty by way of the down spout from an eaves trough mr moore wriggled and struggled about the bed he was sure that he should suffocate unless aid came quickly in his frenzy of terror he managed to roll off the bed the pain and shock of the fall jolted him back to something like sane consideration of his plight where before he had been unable to think intelligently because of the hysterical fear that had claimed him he now lay quietly searching for some means of escape from his dilemma it finally occurred to him that the room in which lord and lady greystoke had been sitting when he left them was directly beneath that in which he lay upon the floor he knew that some time had elapsed since he had come up stairs and that they might be gone by this time for it seemed to him that he had struggled about the bed in his efforts to free himself for an eternity but the best that he could do was to attempt to attract attention from below and so after many failures he managed to work himself into a position in which he could tap the toe of his boot against the floor this he proceeded to do at short intervals until after what seemed a very long time he was rewarded by hearing footsteps ascending the stairs and presently a knock upon the door mr moore tapped vigorously with his toe he could not reply in any other way the knock was repeated after a moment's silence again mr moore tapped would they never open the door laboriously he rolled in the direction of succor if he could get his back against the door he could then tap upon its base when surely he must be heard the knocking was repeated a little louder and finally a voice called mr jack it was one of the house men mr moore recognized the fellow's voice he came near to bursting a blood vessel in an endeavor to scream come in through the stifling gag after a moment the man knocked again quite loudly and again called the boy's name receiving no reply he turned the knob and at the same instant a sudden recollection filled the tutor anew with numbing terror he had himself locked the door behind him when he had entered the room he heard the servant try the door several times and then depart upon which mr moore swooned in the meantime jack was enjoying to the full the stolen pleasures of the music hall he had reached the temple of mirth just as ajax's act was commencing and having purchased a box seat was now leaning breathlessly over the rail watching every move of the great ape his eyes wide in wonder the trainer was not slow to note the boy's handsome eager face and as one of ajax's biggest hits consisted in an entry to one or more boxes during his performance ostensibly in search of a long lost relative as the trainer explained the man realized the effectiveness of sending him into the box with the handsome boy who doubtless would be terror stricken by proximity to the shaggy powerful beast when the time came therefore for the ape to return from the wings in reply to an encore the trainer directed its attention to the boy who chanced to be the sole occupant of the box in which he sat with a spring the huge anthropoid leaped from the stage to the boy's side but if the trainer had looked for a laughable scene of fright he was mistaken a broad smile lighted the boy's features as he laid his hand upon the shaggy arm of his visitor the ape grasping the boy by either shoulder peered long and earnestly into his face while the latter stroked his head and talked to him in a low voice never had ajax devoted so long a time to an examination of another as he did in this instance he seemed troubled and not a little excited jabbering and mumbling to the boy and now caressing him as the trainer had never seen him caress a human being before presently he clambered over into the box with him and snuggled down close to the boy's side the audience was delighted but they were still more delighted when the trainer the period of his act having elapsed attempted to persuade ajax to leave the box the ape would not budge the manager becoming excited at the delay urged the trainer to greater haste but when the latter entered the box to drag away the reluctant ajax he was met by bared fangs and menacing growls the audience was delirious with joy they cheered the ape they cheered the boy and they hooted and jeered at the trainer and the manager which luckless individual had inadvertently shown himself and attempted to assist the trainer finally reduced to desperation and realizing that this show of mutiny upon the part of his valuable possession might render the animal worthless for exhibition purposes in the future if not immediately subdued the trainer had hastened to his dressing room and procured a heavy whip with this he now returned to the box but when he had threatened ajax with it but once he found himself facing two infuriated enemies instead of one for the boy had leaped to his feet and seizing a chair was standing ready at the ape's side to defend his new found friend there was no longer a smile upon his handsome face in his gray eyes was an expression which gave the trainer pause and beside him stood the giant anthropoid growling and ready what might have happened but for a timely interruption may only be surmised but that the trainer would have received a severe mauling if nothing more was clearly indicated by the attitudes of the two who faced him it was a pale faced man who rushed into the greystoke library to announce that he had found jack's door locked and had been able to obtain no response to his repeated knocking and calling other than a strange tapping and the sound of what might have been a body moving about upon the floor four steps at a time john clayton took the stairs that led to the floor above his wife and the servant hurried after him once he called his son's name in a loud voice but receiving no reply he launched his great weight backed by all the undiminished power of his giant muscles against the heavy door with a snapping of iron butts and a splintering of wood the obstacle burst inward at its foot lay the body of the unconscious mr moore across whom it fell with a resounding thud through the opening leaped tarzan and a moment later the room was flooded with light from a dozen electric bulbs it was several minutes before the tutor was discovered so completely had the door covered him but finally he was dragged forth his gag and bonds cut away and a liberal application of cold water had hastened returning consciousness where is jack was john clayton's first question and then who did this as the memory of rokoff and the fear of a second abduction seized him slowly mr moore staggered to his feet his gaze wandered about the room gradually he collected his scattered wits the details of his recent harrowing experience returned to him i tender my resignation sir to take effect at once were his first words you do not need a tutor for your son what he needs is a wild animal trainer but where is he cried lady greystoke he has gone to see ajax it was with difficulty that tarzan restrained a smile and after satisfying himself that the tutor was more scared than injured he ordered his closed car around and departed in the direction of a certain well known music hall chapter 3 as the trainer with raised lash hesitated an instant at the entrance to the box where the boy and the ape confronted him a tall broad shouldered man pushed past him and entered as his eyes fell upon the newcomer a slight flush mounted the boy's cheeks father he exclaimed the ape gave one look at the english lord and then leaped toward him calling out in excited jabbering the man his eyes going wide in astonishment stopped as though turned to stone akut he cried the boy looked bewildered from the ape to his father and from his father to the ape the trainer's jaw dropped as he listened to what followed for from the lips of the englishman flowed the gutturals of an ape that were answered in kind by the huge anthropoid that now clung to him and from the wings a hideously bent and disfigured old man watched the tableau in the box his pock marked features working spasmodically in varying expressions that might have marked every sensation in the gamut from pleasure to terror long have i looked for you tarzan said akut now that i have found you i shall come to your jungle and live there always the man stroked the beast's head through his mind there was running rapidly a train of recollection that carried him far into the depths of the primeval african forest where this huge man like beast had fought shoulder to shoulder with him years before he saw the black mugambi wielding his deadly knob stick and beside them with bared fangs and bristling whiskers sheeta the terrible and pressing close behind the savage and the savage panther the hideous apes of akut the man sighed strong within him surged the jungle lust that he had thought dead ah if he could go back even for a brief month of it to feel again the brush of leafy branches against his naked hide to smell the musty rot of dead vegetation frankincense and myrrh to the jungle born to sense the noiseless coming of the great carnivora upon his trail to hunt and to be hunted to kill the picture was alluring and then came another picture a sweet faced woman still young and beautiful friends a home a son he shrugged his giant shoulders it cannot be akut he said but if you would return i shall see that it is done you could not be happy here i may not be happy there the trainer stepped forward the ape bared his fangs growling go with him akut said tarzan of the apes i will come and see you tomorrow the beast moved sullenly to the trainer's side the latter at john clayton's request told where they might be found tarzan turned toward his son come he said and the two left the theater neither spoke for several minutes after they had entered the limousine it was the boy who broke the silence the ape knew you he said and you spoke together in the ape's tongue how did the ape know you and how did you learn his language and then briefly and for the first time tarzan of the apes told his son of his early life of the birth in the jungle of the death of his parents and of how kala the great she ape had suckled and raised him from infancy almost to manhood he told him too of the dangers and the horrors of the jungle of the great beasts that stalked one by day and by night of the periods of drought and of the cataclysmic rains of hunger of cold of intense heat of nakedness and fear and suffering he told him of all those things that seem most horrible to the creature of civilization in the hope that the knowledge of them might expunge from the lad's mind any inherent desire for the jungle yet they were the very things that made the memory of the jungle what it was to tarzan that made up the composite jungle life he loved and in the telling he forgot one thing the principal thing that the boy at his side listening with eager ears was the son of tarzan of the apes after the boy had been tucked away in bed and without the threatened punishment john clayton told his wife of the events of the evening and that he had at last acquainted the boy with the facts of his jungle life the mother who had long foreseen that her son must some time know of those frightful years during which his father had roamed the jungle a naked savage beast of prey only shook her head hoping against hope that the lure she knew was still strong in the father's breast had not been transmitted to his son tarzan visited akut the following day but though jack begged to be allowed to accompany him he was refused this time tarzan saw the pock marked old owner of the ape whom he did not recognize as the wily paulvitch of former days tarzan influenced by akut's pleadings broached the question of the ape's purchase but paulvitch would not name any price saying that he would consider the matter when tarzan returned home jack was all excitement to hear the details of his visit and finally suggested that his father buy the ape and bring it home lady greystoke was horrified at the suggestion the boy was insistent tarzan explained that he had wished to purchase akut and return him to his jungle home and to this the mother assented jack asked to be allowed to visit the ape but again he was met with flat refusal he had the address however which the trainer had given his father and two days later he found the opportunity to elude his new tutor who had replaced the terrified mr moore and after a considerable search through a section of london which he had never before visited he found the smelly little quarters of the pock marked old man the old fellow himself replied to his knocking and when he stated that he had come to see ajax opened the door and admitted him to the little room which he and the great ape occupied in former years paulvitch had been a fastidious scoundrel but ten years of hideous life among the cannibals of africa had eradicated the last vestige of niceness from his habits his apparel was wrinkled and soiled his hands were unwashed his few straggling locks uncombed his room was a jumble of filthy disorder as the boy entered he saw the great ape squatting upon the bed the coverlets of which were a tangled wad of filthy blankets and ill smelling quilts at sight of the youth the ape leaped to the floor and shuffled forward the man not recognizing his visitor and fearing that the ape meant mischief stepped between them ordering the ape back to the bed he will not hurt me cried the boy we are friends and before he was my father's friend they knew one another in the jungle my father is lord greystoke he does not know that i have come here my mother forbid my coming but i wished to see ajax and i will pay you if you will let me come here often and see him at the mention of the boy's identity paulvitch's eyes narrowed since he had first seen tarzan again from the wings of the theater there had been forming in his deadened brain the beginnings of a desire for revenge it is a characteristic of the weak and criminal to attribute to others the misfortunes that are the result of their own wickedness and so now it was that alexis paulvitch was slowly recalling the events of his past life and as he did so laying at the door of the man whom he and rokoff had so assiduously attempted to ruin and murder all the misfortunes that had befallen him in the failure of their various schemes against their intended victim he saw at first no way in which he could with safety to himself wreak vengeance upon tarzan through the medium of tarzan's son but that great possibilities for revenge lay in the boy was apparent to him and so he determined to cultivate the lad in the hope that fate would play into his hands in some way in the future he told the boy all that he knew of his father's past life in the jungle and when he found that the boy had been kept in ignorance of all these things for so many years and that he had been forbidden visiting the zoological gardens that he had had to bind and gag his tutor to find an opportunity to come to the music hall and see ajax he guessed immediately the nature of the great fear that lay in the hearts of the boy's parents that he might crave the jungle as his father had craved it and so paulvitch encouraged the boy to come and see him often and always he played upon the lad's craving for tales of the savage world with which paulvitch was all too familiar he left him alone with akut much and it was not long until he was surprised to learn that the boy could make the great beast understand him that he had actually learned many of the words of the primitive language of the anthropoids during this period tarzan came several times to visit paulvitch he seemed anxious to purchase ajax and at last he told the man frankly that he was prompted not only by a desire upon his part to return the beast to the liberty of his native jungle but also because his wife feared that in some way her son might learn the whereabouts of the ape and through his attachment for the beast become imbued with the roving instinct which as tarzan explained to paulvitch had so influenced his own life the russian could scarce repress a smile as he listened to lord greystoke's words since scarce a half hour had passed since the time the future lord greystoke had been sitting upon the disordered bed jabbering away to ajax with all the fluency of a born ape it was during this interview that a plan occurred to paulvitch and as a result of it he agreed to accept a certain fabulous sum for the ape and upon receipt of the money to deliver the beast to a vessel that was sailing south from dover for africa two days later he had a double purpose in accepting clayton's offer primarily the money consideration influenced him strongly as the ape was no longer a source of revenue to him having consistently refused to perform upon the stage after having discovered tarzan it was as though the beast had suffered himself to be brought from his jungle home and exhibited before thousands of curious spectators for the sole purpose of searching out his long lost friend and master and having found him considered further mingling with the common herd of humans unnecessary however that may be the fact remained that no amount of persuasion could influence him even to show himself upon the music hall stage and upon the single occasion that the trainer attempted force the results were such that the unfortunate man considered himself lucky to have escaped with his life all that saved him was the accidental presence of jack clayton who had been permitted to visit the animal in the dressing room reserved for him at the music hall and had immediately interfered when he saw that the savage beast meant serious mischief and after the money consideration strong in the heart of the russian was the desire for revenge which had been growing with constant brooding over the failures and miseries of his life which he attributed to tarzan the latest and by no means the least of which was ajax's refusal to longer earn money for him the ape's refusal he traced directly to tarzan finally convincing himself that the ape man had instructed the great anthropoid to refuse to go upon the stage paulvitch's naturally malign disposition was aggravated by the weakening and warping of his mental and physical faculties through torture and privation from cold calculating highly intelligent perversity it had deteriorated into the indiscriminating dangerous menace of the mentally defective his plan however was sufficiently cunning to at least cast a doubt upon the assertion that his mentality was wandering it assured him first of the competence which lord greystoke had promised to pay him for the deportation of the ape and then of revenge upon his benefactor through the son he idolized that part of his scheme was crude and brutal it lacked the refinement of torture that had marked the master strokes of the paulvitch of old when he had worked with that virtuoso of villainy nikolas rokoff but it at least assured paulvitch of immunity from responsibility placing that upon the ape who would thus also be punished for his refusal longer to support the russian everything played with fiendish unanimity into paulvitch's hands as chance would have it tarzan's son overheard his father relating to the boy's mother the steps he was taking to return akut safely to his jungle home and having overheard he begged them to bring the ape home that he might have him for a play fellow tarzan would not have been averse to this plan but lady greystoke was horrified at the very thought of it jack pleaded with his mother but all unavailingly she was obdurate and at last the lad appeared to acquiesce in his mother's decision that the ape must be returned to africa and the boy to school from which he had been absent on vacation he did not attempt to visit paulvitch's room again that day but instead busied himself in other ways he had always been well supplied with money so that when necessity demanded he had no difficulty in collecting several hundred pounds some of this money he invested in various strange purchases which he managed to smuggle into the house undetected when he returned late in the afternoon the next morning after giving his father time to precede him and conclude his business with paulvitch the lad hastened to the russian's room knowing nothing of the man's true character the boy dared not take him fully into his confidence for fear that the old fellow would not only refuse to aid him but would report the whole affair to his father instead he simply asked permission to take ajax to dover he explained that it would relieve the old man of a tiresome journey as well as placing a number of pounds in his pocket for the lad purposed paying the russian well you see he went on there will be no danger of detection since i am supposed to be leaving on an afternoon train for school instead i will come here after they have left me on board the train then i can take ajax to dover you see and arrive at school only a day late no one will be the wiser no harm will be done and i shall have had an extra day with ajax before i lose him forever the plan fitted perfectly with that which paulvitch had in mind had he known what further the boy contemplated he would doubtless have entirely abandoned his own scheme of revenge and aided the boy whole heartedly in the consummation of the lad's which would have been better for paulvitch could he have but read the future but a few short hours ahead that afternoon lord and lady greystoke bid their son good bye and saw him safely settled in a first class compartment of the railway carriage that would set him down at school in a few hours no sooner had they left him however than he gathered his bags together descended from the compartment and sought a cab stand outside the station here he engaged a cabby to take him to the russian's address it was dusk when he arrived he found paulvitch awaiting him the man was pacing the floor nervously the ape was tied with a stout cord to the bed it was the first time that jack had ever seen ajax thus secured he looked questioningly at paulvitch the man mumbling explained that he believed the animal had guessed that he was to be sent away and he feared he would attempt to escape paulvitch carried another piece of cord in his hand there was a noose in one end of it which he was continually playing with he walked back and forth up and down the room his pock marked features were working horribly as he talked silent to himself the boy had never seen him thus it made him uneasy at last paulvitch stopped on the opposite side of the room far from the ape come here he said to the lad i will show you how to secure the ape should he show signs of rebellion during the trip the lad laughed it will not be necessary he replied ajax will do whatever i tell him to do the old man stamped his foot angrily come here as i tell you he repeated if you do not do as i say you shall not accompany the ape to dover i will take no chances upon his escaping still smiling the lad crossed the room and stood before the russ turn around with your back toward me directed the latter that i may show you how to bind him quickly the boy did as he was bid placing his hands behind him when paulvitch told him to do so instantly the old man slipped the running noose over one of the lad's wrists took a couple of half hitches about his other wrist and knotted the cord the moment that the boy was secured the attitude of the man changed with an angry oath he wheeled his prisoner about tripped him and hurled him violently to the floor leaping upon his breast as he fell from the bed the ape growled and struggled with his bonds the boy did not cry out a trait inherited from his savage sire whom long years in the jungle following the death of his foster mother kala the great ape had taught that there was none to come to the succor of the fallen paulvitch's fingers sought the lad's throat he grinned down horribly into the face of his victim your father ruined me he mumbled this will pay him he will think that the ape did it i will tell him that the ape did it that i left him alone for a few minutes and that you sneaked in and the ape killed you i will throw your body upon the bed after i have choked the life from you and when i bring your father he will see the ape squatting over it and the twisted fiend cackled in gloating laughter his fingers closed upon the boy's throat behind them the growling of the maddened beast reverberated against the walls of the little room the boy paled but no other sign of fear or panic showed upon his countenance he was the son of tarzan the fingers tightened their grip upon his throat it was with difficulty that he breathed gaspingly the ape lunged against the stout cord that held him turning he wrapped the cord about his hands as a man might have done and surged heavily backward the great muscles stood out beneath his shaggy hide there was a rending as of splintered wood the cord held but a portion of the footboard of the bed came away at the sound paulvitch looked up his hideous face went white with terror the ape was free with a single bound the creature was upon him the man shrieked the brute wrenched him from the body of the boy great fingers sunk into the man's flesh yellow fangs gaped close to his throat he struggled futilely and when they closed the soul of alexis paulvitch passed into the keeping of the demons who had long been awaiting it the boy struggled to his feet assisted by akut for two hours under the instructions of the former the ape worked upon the knots that secured his friend's wrists finally they gave up their secret and the boy was free then he opened one of his bags and drew forth some garments his plans had been well made he did not consult the beast which did all that he directed together they slunk from the house but no casual observer might have noted that one of them was an ape chapter 4 the killing of the friendless old russian michael sabrov by his great trained ape was a matter for newspaper comment for a few days lord greystoke read of it and while taking special precautions not to permit his name to become connected with the affair kept himself well posted as to the police search for the anthropoid as was true of the general public his chief interest in the matter centered about the mysterious disappearance of the slayer or at least this was true until he learned several days subsequent to the tragedy that his son jack had not reported at the public school en route for which they had seen him safely ensconced in a railway carriage even then"
