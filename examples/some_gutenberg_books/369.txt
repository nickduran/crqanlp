i say thy prayers and compose thyself for death henry iii king of england sat in his council chamber surrounded by the great lords and nobles who composed his suit he awaited simon de montfort earl of leicester whom he had summoned that he might heap still further indignities upon him with the intention of degrading and humiliating him that he might leave england forever the king feared this mighty kinsman who so boldly advised him against the weak follies which were bringing his kingdom to a condition of revolution what the outcome of this audience would have been none may say for leicester had but just entered and saluted his sovereign when there came an interruption which drowned the petty wrangles of king and courtier in a common affliction that touched the hearts of all there was a commotion at one side of the room the arras parted and eleanor queen of england staggered toward the throne tears streaming down her pale cheeks oh my lord my lord she cried richard our son has been assassinated and thrown into the thames in an instant all was confusion and turmoil and it was with the greatest difficulty that the king finally obtained a coherent statement from his queen it seemed that when the lady maud had not returned to the palace with prince richard at the proper time the queen had been notified and an immediate search had been instituted a search which did not end for over twenty years but the first fruits of it turned the hearts of the court to stone for there beside the open postern gate lay the dead bodies of lady maud and a certain officer of the guards but nowhere was there a sign or trace of prince richard second son of henry iii of england and at that time the youngest prince of the realm it was two days before the absence of de vac was noted and then it was that one of the lords in waiting to the king reminded his majesty of the episode of the fencing bout and a motive for the abduction of the king's little son became apparent an edict was issued requiring the examination of every child in england for on the left breast of the little prince was a birthmark which closely resembled a lily and when after a year no child was found bearing such a mark and no trace of de vac uncovered the search was carried into france nor was it ever wholly relinquished at any time for more than twenty years the first theory of assassination was quickly abandoned when it was subjected to the light of reason for it was evident that an assassin could have dispatched the little prince at the same time that he killed the lady maud and her lover had such been his desire the most eager factor in the search for prince richard was simon de montfort earl of leicester whose affection for his royal nephew had always been so marked as to have been commented upon by the members of the king's household thus for a time the rupture between de montfort and his king was healed and although the great nobleman was divested of his authority in gascony he suffered little further oppression at the hands of his royal master chapter iv as de vac drew his sword from the heart of the lady maud he winced for merciless though he was he had shrunk from this cruel task too far he had gone however to back down now and had he left the lady maud alive the whole of the palace guard and all the city of london would have been on his heels in ten minutes there would have been no escape the little prince was now so terrified that he could but tremble and whimper in his fright so fearful was he of the terrible de vac that a threat of death easily stilled his tongue and so the grim old man led him to the boat hidden deep in the dense bushes de vac did not dare remain in this retreat until dark as he had first intended instead he drew a dingy ragged dress from the bundle beneath the thwart and in this disguised himself as an old woman drawing a cotton wimple low over his head and forehead to hide his short hair concealing the child beneath the other articles of clothing he pushed off from the bank and rowing close to the shore hastened down the thames toward the old dock where the previous night he had concealed his skiff he reached his destination unnoticed and running in beneath the dock worked the boat far into the dark recess of the cave like retreat here he determined to hide until darkness had fallen for he knew that the search would be on for the little lost prince at any moment and that none might traverse the streets of london without being subject to the closest scrutiny taking advantage of the forced wait de vac undressed the prince and clothed him in other garments which had been wrapped in the bundle hidden beneath the thwart a little red cotton tunic with hose to match a black doublet and a tiny leather jerkin and leather cap the discarded clothing of the prince he wrapped about a huge stone torn from the disintegrating masonry of the river wall and consigned the bundle to the voiceless river the prince had by now regained some of his former assurance and finding that de vac seemed not to intend harming him the little fellow commenced questioning his grim companion his childish wonder at this strange adventure getting the better of his former apprehension what do we here sir jules he asked take me back to the king's my father's palace i like not this dark hole nor the strange garments you have placed upon me silence boy commanded the old man sir jules be dead nor are you a king's son remember these two things well nor ever again let me hear you speak the name sir jules or call yourself a prince the boy went silent again cowed by the fierce tone of his captor presently he began to whimper for he was tired and hungry and frightened just a poor little baby helpless and hopeless in the hands of this cruel enemy all his royalty as nothing all gone with the silken finery which lay in the thick mud at the bottom of the thames and presently he dropped into a fitful sleep in the bottom of the skiff when darkness had settled de vac pushed the skiff outward to the side of the dock and gathering the sleeping child in his arms stood listening preparatory to mounting to the alley which led to old til's place as he stood thus a faint sound of clanking armor came to his attentive ears louder and louder it grew until there could be no doubt but that a number of men were approaching de vac resumed his place in the skiff and again drew it far beneath the dock scarcely had he done so ere a party of armored knights and men at arms clanked out upon the planks above him from the mouth of the dark alley here they stopped as though for consultation and plainly could the listener below hear every word of their conversation de montfort said one what thinkest thou of it can it be that the queen is right and that richard lies dead beneath these black waters no de clare replied a deep voice which de vac recognized as that of the earl of leicester the hand that could steal the prince from out of the very gardens of his sire without the knowledge of lady maud or her companion which must evidently have been the case could more easily and safely have dispatched him within the gardens had that been the object of this strange attack i think my lord that presently we shall hear from some bold adventurer who holds the little prince for ransom god give that such may be the case for of all the winsome and affectionate little fellows i have ever seen not even excepting mine own dear son the little richard was the most to be beloved would that i might get my hands upon the foul devil who has done this horrid deed beneath the planks not four feet from where leicester stood lay the object of his search the clanking armor the heavy spurred feet and the voices above him had awakened the little prince and with a startled cry he sat upright in the bottom of the skiff instantly de vac's iron band clapped over the tiny mouth but not before a single faint wail had reached the ears of the men above hark what was that my lord cried one of the men at arms in tense silence they listened for a repetition of the sound and then de montfort cried out what ho below there who is it beneath the dock answer in the name of the king richard recognizing the voice of his favorite uncle struggled to free himself but de vac's ruthless hand crushed out the weak efforts of the babe and all was quiet as the tomb while those above stood listening for a repetition of the sound dock rats said de clare and then as though the devil guided them to protect his own two huge rats scurried upward from between the loose boards and ran squealing up the dark alley right you are said de montfort but i could have sworn twas a child's feeble wail had i not seen the two filthy rodents with mine own eyes come let us to the next vile alley we have met with no success here though that old hag who called herself til seemed overanxious to bargain for the future information she seemed hopeful of being able to give us as they moved off their voices grew fainter in the ears of the listeners beneath the dock and soon were lost in the distance a close shave thought de vac as he again took up the child and prepared to gain the dock no further noises occurring to frighten him he soon reached the door to til's house and inserting the key crept noiselessly to the garret room which he had rented from his ill favored hostess there were no stairs from the upper floor to the garret above this ascent being made by means of a wooden ladder which de vac pulled up after him closing and securing the aperture through which he climbed with his burden by means of a heavy trapdoor equipped with thick bars the apartment which they now entered extended across the entire east end of the building and had windows upon three sides these were heavily curtained the apartment was lighted by a small cresset hanging from a rafter near the center of the room the walls were unplastered and the rafters unceiled the whole bearing a most barnlike and unhospitable appearance in one corner was a huge bed and across the room a smaller cot a cupboard a table and two benches completed the furnishings these articles de vac had purchased for the room against the time when he should occupy it with his little prisoner on the table were a loaf of black bread an earthenware jar containing honey a pitcher of milk and two drinking horns to these de vac immediately gave his attention commanding the child to partake of what he wished hunger for the moment overcame the little prince's fears and he set to with avidity upon the strange rough fare made doubly coarse by the rude utensils and the bare surroundings so unlike the royal magnificence of his palace apartments while the child ate de vac hastened to the lower floor of the building in search of til whom he now thoroughly mistrusted and feared the words of de montfort which he had overheard at the dock convinced him that here was one more obstacle to the fulfillment of his revenge which must be removed as had the lady maud but in this instance there was neither youth nor beauty to plead the cause of the intended victim or to cause the grim executioner a pang of remorse when he found the old hag she was already dressed to go upon the street in fact he intercepted her at the very door of the building still clad as he was in the mantle and wimple of an old woman til did not at first recognize him and when he spoke she burst into a nervous cackling laugh as one caught in the perpetration of some questionable act nor did her manner escape the shrewd notice of the wily master of fence whither old hag he asked to visit mag tunk at the alley's end by the river my lord she replied with more respect than she had been wont to accord him then i will accompany you part way my friend and perchance you can give me a hand with some packages i left behind me in the skiff i have moored there and so the two walked together through the dark alley to the end of the rickety dismantled dock the one thinking of the vast reward the king would lavish upon her for the information she felt sure she alone could give the other feeling beneath his mantle for the hilt of a long dagger which nestled there as they reached the water's edge de vac was walking with his right shoulder behind his companion's left in his hand was gripped the keen blade and as the woman halted on the dock the point that hovered just below her left shoulder blade plunged soundless into her heart at the same instant that de vac's left hand swung up and grasped her throat in a grip of steel there was no sound barely a struggle of the convulsively stiffening old muscles and then with a push from de vac the body lunged forward into the thames where a dull splash marked the end of the last hope that prince richard might be rescued from the clutches of his nemesis chapter v for three years following the disappearance of prince richard a bent old woman lived in the heart of london within a stone's throw of the king's palace in a small back room she lived high up in the attic of an old building and with her was a little boy who never went abroad alone nor by day and upon his left breast was a strange mark which resembled a lily when the bent old woman was safely in her attic room with bolted door behind her she was wont to straighten up and discard her dingy mantle for more comfortable and becoming doublet and hose for years she worked assiduously with the little boy's education there were three subjects in her curriculum french swordsmanship and hatred of all things english especially the reigning house of england the old woman had had made a tiny foil and had commenced teaching the little boy the art of fence when he was but three years old you will be the greatest swordsman in the world when you are twenty my son she was wont to say and then you shall go out and kill many englishmen your name shall be hated and cursed the length and breadth of england and when you finally stand with the halter about your neck aha then will i speak then shall they know the little boy did not understand it all he only knew that he was comfortable and had warm clothing and all he required to eat and that he would be a great man when he learned to fight with a real sword and had grown large enough to wield one he also knew that he hated englishmen but why he did not know way back in the uttermost recesses of his little childish head he seemed to remember a time when his life and surroundings had been very different when instead of this old woman there had been many people around him and a sweet faced woman had held him in her arms and kissed him before he was taken off to bed at night but he could not be sure maybe it was only a dream he remembered for he dreamed many strange and wonderful dreams when the little boy was about six years of age a strange man came to their attic home to visit the little old woman it was in the dusk of the evening but the old woman did not light the cresset and further she whispered to the little boy to remain in the shadows of a far corner of the bare chamber the stranger was old and bent and had a great beard which hid almost his entire face except for two piercing eyes a great nose and a bit of wrinkled forehead when he spoke he accompanied his words with many shrugs of his narrow shoulders and with waving of his arms and other strange and amusing gesticulations the child was fascinated here was the first amusement of his little starved life he listened intently to the conversation which was in french i have just the thing for madame the stranger was saying it be a noble and stately hall far from the beaten way it was built in the old days by harold the saxon but in later times death and poverty and the disfavor of the king have wrested it from his descendants a few years since henry granted it to that spend thrift favorite of his henri de macy who pledged it to me for a sum he hath been unable to repay today it be my property and as it be far from paris you may have it for the mere song i have named it be a wondrous bargain madame and when i come upon it i shall find that i have bought a crumbling pile of ruined masonry unfit to house a family of foxes replied the old woman peevishly one tower hath fallen and the roof for half the length of one wing hath sagged and tumbled in explained the old frenchman but the three lower stories be intact and quite habitable it be much grander even now than the castles of many of england's noble barons and the price madame ah the price be so ridiculously low still the old woman hesitated come said the frenchman i have it deposit the money with isaac the jew thou knowest him and he shall hold it together with the deed for forty days which will give thee ample time to travel to derby and inspect thy purchase if thou be not entirely satisfied isaac the jew shall return thy money to thee and the deed to me but if at the end of forty days thou hast not made demand for thy money then shall isaac send the deed to thee and the money to me be not this an easy and fair way out of the difficulty the little old woman thought for a moment and at last conceded that it seemed quite a fair way to arrange the matter and thus it was accomplished several days later the little old woman called the child to her we start tonight upon a long journey to our new home thy face shall be wrapped in many rags for thou hast a most grievous toothache dost understand but i have no toothache my teeth do not pain me at all i expostulated the child tut tut interrupted the little old woman thou hast a toothache and so thy face must be wrapped in many rags and listen should any ask thee upon the way why thy face be so wrapped thou art to say that thou hast a toothache and thou do not do as i say the king's men will take us and we shall be hanged for the king hateth us if thou hatest the english king and lovest thy life do as i command i hate the king replied the little boy for this reason i shall do as thou sayest so it was that they set out that night upon their long journey north toward the hills of derby for many days they travelled riding upon two small donkeys strange sights filled the days for the little boy who remembered nothing outside the bare attic of his london home and the dirty london alleys that he had traversed only by night they wound across beautiful parklike meadows and through dark forbidding forests and now and again they passed tiny hamlets of thatched huts occasionally they saw armored knights upon the highway alone or in small parties but the child's companion always managed to hasten into cover at the road side until the grim riders had passed once as they lay in hiding in a dense wood beside a little open glade across which the road wound the boy saw two knights enter the glade from either side for a moment they drew rein and eyed each other in silence and then one a great black mailed knight upon a black charger cried out something to the other which the boy could not catch the other knight made no response other than to rest his lance upon his thigh and with lowered point ride toward his ebon adversary for a dozen paces their great steeds trotted slowly toward one another but presently the knights urged them into full gallop and when the two iron men on their iron trapped chargers came together in the center of the glade it was with all the terrific impact of full charge the lance of the black knight smote full upon the linden shield of his foeman the staggering weight of the mighty black charger hurtled upon the gray who went down with his rider into the dust of the highway the momentum of the black carried him fifty paces beyond the fallen horseman before his rider could rein him in then the black knight turned to view the havoc he had wrought the gray horse was just staggering dizzily to his feet but his mailed rider lay quiet and still where he had fallen with raised visor the black knight rode back to the side of his vanquished foe there was a cruel smile upon his lips as he leaned toward the prostrate form he spoke tauntingly but there was no response then he prodded the fallen man with the point of his spear even this elicited no movement with a shrug of his iron clad shoulders the black knight wheeled and rode on down the road until he had disappeared from sight within the gloomy shadows of the encircling forest the little boy was spell bound naught like this had he ever seen or dreamed some day thou shalt go and do likewise my son said the little old woman shall i be clothed in armor and ride upon a great black steed he asked yes and thou shalt ride the highways of england with thy stout lance and mighty sword and behind thee thou shalt leave a trail of blood and death for every man shalt be thy enemy but come we must be on our way they rode on leaving the dead knight where he had fallen but always in his memory the child carried the thing that he had seen longing for the day when he should be great and strong like the formidable black knight on another day as they were biding in a deserted hovel to escape the notice of a caravan of merchants journeying up country with their wares they saw a band of ruffians rush out from the concealing shelter of some bushes at the far side of the highway and fall upon the surprised and defenseless tradesmen ragged bearded uncouth villains they were armed mostly with bludgeons and daggers with here and there a cross bow without mercy they attacked the old and the young beating them down in cold blood even when they offered no resistance those of the caravan who could escaped the balance the highwaymen left dead or dying in the road as they hurried away with their loot at first the child was horror struck but when he turned to the little old woman for sympathy he found a grim smile upon her thin lips she noted his expression of dismay it is naught my son but english curs setting upon english swine some day thou shalt set upon both they be only fit for killing the boy made no reply but he thought a great deal about that which he had seen knights were cruel to knights the poor were cruel to the rich and every day of the journey had forced upon his childish mind that everyone must be very cruel and hard upon the poor he had seen them in all their sorrow and misery and poverty stretching a long scattering line all the way from london town their bent backs their poor thin bodies and their hopeless sorrowful faces attesting the weary wretchedness of their existence be no one happy in all the world he once broke out to the old woman only he who wields the mightiest sword responded the old woman you have seen my son that all englishmen are beasts they set upon and kill one another for little provocation or for no provocation at all when thou shalt be older thou shalt go forth and kill them all for unless thou kill them they will kill thee at length after tiresome days upon the road they came to a little hamlet in the hills here the donkeys were disposed of and a great horse purchased upon which the two rode far up into a rough and uninviting country away from the beaten track until late one evening they approached a ruined castle the frowning walls towered high against the moonlit sky beyond and where a portion of the roof had fallen in the cold moon shining through the narrow unglazed windows gave to the mighty pile the likeness of a huge many eyed ogre crouching upon the flank of a deserted world for nowhere was there other sign of habitation before this somber pile the two dismounted the little boy was filled with awe and his childish imagination ran riot as they approached the crumbling barbican on foot leading the horse after them from the dark shadows of the ballium they passed into the moonlit inner court at the far end the old woman found the ancient stables and here with decaying planks she penned the horse for the night pouring a measure of oats upon the floor for him from a bag which had hung across his rump then she led the way into the dense shadows of the castle lighting their advance with a flickering pine knot the old planking of the floors long unused groaned and rattled beneath their approach there was a sudden scamper of clawed feet before them and a red fox dashed by in a frenzy of alarm toward the freedom of the outer night presently they came to the great hall the old woman pushed open the great doors upon their creaking hinges and lit up dimly the mighty cavernous interior with the puny rays of their feeble torch as they stepped cautiously within an impalpable dust arose in little spurts from the long rotted rushes that crumbled beneath their feet a huge bat circled wildly with loud fluttering wings in evident remonstrance at this rude intrusion strange creatures of the night scurried or wriggled across wall and floor but the child was unafraid fear had not been a part of the old woman's curriculum the boy did not know the meaning of the word nor was he ever in his after life to experience the sensation with childish eagerness he followed his companion as she inspected the interior of the chamber it was still an imposing room the boy clapped his hands in delight at the beauties of the carved and panelled walls and the oak beamed ceiling stained almost black from the smoke of torches and oil cressets that had lighted it in bygone days aided no doubt by the wood fires which had burned in its two immense fireplaces to cheer the merry throng of noble revellers that had so often sat about the great table into the morning hours here they took up their abode but the bent old woman was no longer an old woman she had become a straight wiry active old man the little boy's education went on french swordsmanship and hatred of the english the same thing year after year with the addition of horsemanship after he was ten years old at this time the old man commenced teaching him to speak english but with a studied and very marked french accent during all his life now he could not remember of having spoken to any living being other than his guardian whom he had been taught to address as father nor did the boy have any name he was just my son his life in the derby hills was so filled with the hard exacting duties of his education that he had little time to think of the strange loneliness"
