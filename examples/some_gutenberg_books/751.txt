"1" "look down on all their light discovers the traitor's smile the murderer's frown the lips of lying lovers they try to shut their saddening eyes and in the vain endeavour we see them twinkling in the skies and so they wink forever what do _you_ think of these verses my friends is that piece an impromptu said my landlady's daughter aet 19 tender eyed blonde long ringlets cameo pin gold pencil case on a chain locket bracelet album autograph book accordeon reads byron tupper and sylvanus cobb junior while her mother makes the puddings says yes when you tell her anything _oui et non_ _ma petite_ yes and no my child five of the seven verses were written off hand the other two took a week that is were hanging round the desk in a ragged forlorn unrhymed condition as long as that all poets will tell you just such stories _c'est le_ dernier _pas qui coute_ don't you know how hard it is for some people to get out of a room after their visit is really over they want to be off and you want to have them off but they don't know how to manage it one would think they had been built in your parlour or study and were waiting to be launched i have contrived a sort of ceremonial inclined plane for such visitors which being lubricated with certain smooth phrases i back them down metaphorically speaking stern foremost into their native element the great ocean of out doors well now there are poems as hard to get rid of as these rural visitors they come in glibly use up all the serviceable rhymes _day_ _ray_ _beauty_ _duty_ _skies_ _eyes_ _other_ _brother_ _mountain_ _fountain_ and the like and so they go on until you think it is time for the wind up and the wind up won't come on any terms so they lie about until you get sick of the sight of them and end by thrusting some cold scrap of a final couplet upon them and turning them out of doors i suspect a good many impromptus could tell just such a story as the above here turning to our landlady i used an illustration which pleased the company much at the time and has since been highly commanded madam i said you can pour three gills and three quarters of honey from that pint jug if it is full in less than one minute but madam you could not empty that last quarter of a gill though you were turned into a marble hebe and held the vessel upside down for a thousand years picture the landlady's daughter one gets tired to death of the old old rhymes such as you see in that copy of verses which i don't mean to abuse or to praise either i always feel as if i were a cobbler putting new top leathers to an old pair of boot soles and bodies when i am fitting sentiments to these venerable jingles youth morning truth warning nine tenths of the juvenile poems written spring out of the above musical and suggestive coincidences yes said our landlady's daughter i did not address the following remark to her and i trust from her limited range of reading she will never see it i said it softly to my next neighbour when a young female wears a flat circular side curl gummed on each temple when she walks with a male not arm in arm but his arm against the back of hers and when she says yes with the note of interrogation you are generally safe in asking her what wages she gets and who the feller was you saw her with what were you whispering said the daughter of the house moistening her lips as she spoke in a very engaging manner i was only laying down a principle of social diagnosis yes it is curious to see how the same wants and tastes find the same implements and modes of expression in all times and places the young ladies of otaheite as you may see in cook's voyages had a sort of crinoline arrangement fully equal in radius to the largest spread of our own lady baskets when i fling a bay state shawl over my shoulders i am only taking a lesson from the climate that the indian had learned before me a _blanket_ shawl we call it and not a plaid and we wear it like the aborigines and not like the highlanders we are the romans of the modern world the great assimilating people conflicts and conquests are of course necessary accidents with us as with our prototypes and so we come to their style of weapon our army sword is the short stiff pointed _gladius_ of the romans and the american bowie knife is the same tool modified to meet the daily wants of civil society i announce at this table an axiom not to be found in montesquieu or the journals of congress the race that shortens its weapons lengthens its boundaries _corollary_ it was the polish _lance_ that left poland at last with nothing of her own to bound dropped from her nerveless grasp the _shattered spear_ what business had sarmatia to be fighting for liberty with a fifteen foot pole between her and the breasts of her enemies if she had but clutched the old roman and young american weapon and come to close quarters there might have been a chance for her but it would have spoiled the best passage in the pleasures of hope self made men well yes of course everybody likes and respects self made men it is a great deal better to be made in that way than not to be made at all are any of you younger people old enough to remember that irishman's house on the marsh at cambridgeport which house he built from drain to chimney top with his own hands it took him a good many years to build it and one could see that it was a little out of plumb and a little wavy in outline and a little queer and uncertain in general aspect a regular hand could certainly have built a better house but it was a very good house for a self made carpenter's house and people praised it and said how remarkably well the irishman had succeeded they never thought of praising the fine blocks of houses a little farther on your self made man whittled into shape with his own jack knife deserves more credit if that is all than the regular engine turned article shaped by the most approved pattern and french polished by society and travel but as to saying that one is every way the equal of the other that is another matter the right of strict social discrimination of all things and persons according to their merits native or acquired is one of the most precious republican privileges i take the liberty to exercise it when i say that _other things being equal_ in most relations of life i prefer a man of family what do i mean by a man of family o i'll give you a general idea of what i mean let us give him a first rate fit out it costs us nothing four or five generations of gentlemen and gentlewomen among them a member of his majesty's council for the province a governor or so one or two doctors of divinity a member of congress not later than the time of top boots with tassels family portraits the member of the council by smibert the great

gallery books too with the names of old college students in them family names you will find them at the head of their respective classes in the days when students took rank on the catalogue from their parents condition elzevirs with the latinized appellations of youthful progenitors and _hic liber est meus_ on the title page a set of hogarth's original plates pope original edition 15 volumes london 1717 barrow on the lower shelves in folio tillotson on the upper in a little dark platoon of octo decimos some family silver a string of wedding and funeral rings the arms of the family curiously blazoned the same in worsted by a maiden aunt if the man of family has an old place to keep these things in furnished with claw footed chairs and black mahogany tables and tall bevel edged mirrors and stately upright cabinets his outfit is complete no my friends i go always other things being equal for the man who inherits family traditions and the cumulative humanities of at least four or five generations above all things as a child he should have tumbled about in a library all men are afraid of books who have not handled them from infancy do you suppose our dear _didascalos_ over there ever read _poli synopsis_ or consulted _castelli lexicon_ while he was growing up to their stature not he but virtue passed through the hem of their parchment and leather garments whenever he touched them as the precious drugs sweated through the bat's handle in the arabian story i tell you he is at home wherever he smells the invigorating fragrance of russia leather no self made man feels so one may it is true have all the antecedents i have spoken of and yet be a boor or a shabby fellow one may have none of them and yet be fit for councils and courts then let them change places our social arrangement has this great beauty that its strata shift up and down as they change specific gravity without being clogged by layers of prescription but i still insist on my democratic liberty of choice and i go for the man with the gallery of family portraits against the one with the twenty five cent daguerreotype unless i find out that the last is the better of the two i should have felt more nervous about the late comet if i had thought the world was ripe but it is very green yet if i am not mistaken and besides there is a great deal of coal to use up which i cannot bring myself to think was made for nothing if certain things which seem to me essential to a millennium had come to pass i should have been frightened but they haven't perhaps you would like to hear my latter day warnings when legislators keep the law when banks dispense with bolts and locks when berries whortle rasp and straw grow bigger _downwards_ through the box when he that selleth house or land shows leak in roof or flaw in right when haberdashers choose the stand whose window hath the broadest light when preachers tell us all they think and party leaders all they mean when what we pay for that we drink from real grape and coffee bean when lawyers take what they would give and doctors give what they would take when city fathers eat to live save when they fast for conscience sake when one that hath a horse on sale shall bring his merit to the proof without a lie for every nail that holds the iron on the hoof when in the usual place for rips our gloves are stitched with special care and guarded well the whalebone tips where first umbrellas need repair when cuba's weeds have quite forgot the power of suction to resist and claret bottles harber not such dimples as would hold your fist when publishers no longer steal and pay for what they stole before when the first locomotive's wheel rolls through the hoosac tunnel's bore _till_ then let cumming a blaze away and miller's saints blow up the globe but when you see that blessed day _then_ order your ascension robe the company seemed to like the verses and i promised them to read others occasionally if they had a mind to hear them of course they would not expect it every morning neither must the reader suppose that all these things i have reported were said at any one breakfast time i have not taken the trouble to date them as raspail _pere_ used to date every proof he sent to the printer but they were scattered over several breakfasts and i have said a good many more things since which i shall very possibly print some time or other if i am urged to do it by judicious friends i finished off with reading some verses of my friend the professor of whom you may perhaps hear more by and by the professor read them he told me at a farewell meeting where the youngest of our great historians met a few of his many friends at their invitation yes we knew we must lose him though friendship may claim to blend her green leaves with the laurels of fame though fondly at parting we call him our own tis the whisper of love when the bugle has blown as the rider that rests with the spur on his heel as the guardsman that sleeps in his corselet of steel as the archer that stands with his shaft on the string he stoops from his toil to the garland we bring what pictures yet slumber unborn in his loom till their warriors shall breathe and their beauties shall bloom while the tapestry lengthens the life glowing dyes that caught from our sunsets the stain of their skies in the alcoves of death in the charnels of time where flit the gaunt spectres of passion and crime there are triumphs untold there are martyrs unsung there are heroes yet silent to speak with his tongue let us hear the proud story which time has bequeathed from lips that are warm with the freedom they breathed let him summon its tyrants and tell us their doom though he sweep the black past like van tromp with his broom the dream flashes by for the west winds awake on pampas on prairie o'er mountain and lake to bathe the swift bark like a sea girdled shrine with incense they stole from the rose and the pine so fill a bright cup with the sunlight that gushed when the dead summer's jewels were trampled and crushed the true knight of learning the world holds him dear love bless him joy crown him god speed his career chapter ii i really believe some people save their bright thoughts as being too precious for conversation what do you think an admiring friend said the other day to one that was talking good things good enough to print why said he you are wasting mechantable literature a cash article at the rate as nearly as i can tell of fifty dollars an hour the talker took him to the window and asked him to look out and tell what he saw nothing but a very dusty street he said and a man driving a sprinkling machine through it why don't you tell the man he is wasting that water what would be the state of the highways of life if we did not drive our _thought sprinklers_ through them with the valves open sometimes besides there is another thing about this talking which you forget it shapes our thoughts for us the waves of conversation roll them as the surf rolls the pebbles on the shore let me modify the image a little i rough out my thoughts in talk as an artist models in clay spoken language is so plastic you can pat and coax and spread and shave and rub out and fill up and stick on so easily when you work that soft material that there is nothing like it for modelling out of it come the shapes which you turn into marble or bronze in your immortal books if you happen to write such or to use another illustration writing or printing is like shooting with a rifle you may hit your reader's mind or miss it but talking is like playing at a mark with the pipe of an engine if it is within reach and you have time enough you can't help hitting it the company agreed that this last illustration was of superior excellence or in the phrase used by them fust rate i acknowledged the compliment but gently rebuked the expression fust rate prime a prime article a superior piece of goods a handsome garment a gent in a flowered vest all such expressions are final they blast the lineage of him or her who utters them for generations up and down there is one other phrase which will soon come to be decisive of a man's social _status_ if it is not already that tells the whole story it is an expression which vulgar and conceited people particularly affect and which well meaning ones who know better catch from them it is intended to stop all debate like the previous question in the general court only it doesn't simply because that does not usually tell the whole nor one half of the whole story it is an odd idea that almost all our people have had a professional education to become a doctor a man must study some three years and hear a thousand lectures more or less just how much study it takes to make a lawyer i cannot say but probably not more than this now most decent people hear one hundred lectures or sermons discourses on theology every year and this twenty thirty fifty years together they read a great many religious books besides the clergy however rarely hear any sermons except what they preach themselves a dull preacher might be conceived therefore to lapse into a state of _quasi_ heathenism simply for want of religious instruction and on the other hand an attentive and intelligent hearer listening to a succession of wise teachers might become actually better educated in theology than any one of them we are all theological students and more of us qualified as doctors of divinity than have received degrees at any of the universities it is not strange therefore that very good people should often find it difficult if not impossible to keep their attention fixed upon a sermon treating feebly a subject which they have thought vigorously about for years and heard able men discuss scores of times i have often noticed however that a hopelessly dull discourse acts _inductively_ as electricians would say in developing strong mental currents i am ashamed to think with what accompaniments and variations and _fioriture_ i have sometimes followed the droning of a heavy speaker not willingly for my habit is reverential but as a necessary result of a slight continuous impression on the senses and the mind which kept both in action without furnishing the food they required to work upon if you ever saw a crow with a king bird after him you will get an image of a dull speaker and a lively listener the bird in sable plumage flaps heavily along his straight forward course while the other sails round him over him under him leaves him comes back again tweaks out a black feather shoots away once more never losing sight of him and finally reaches the crow's perch at the same time the crow does having cut a perfect labyrinth of loops and knots and spirals while the slow fowl was painfully working from one end of his straight line to the other i think these remarks were received rather coolly a temporary boarder from the country consisting of a somewhat more than middle aged female with a parchment forehead and a dry little frisette shingling it a sallow neck with a necklace of gold beads a black dress too rusty for recent grief and contours in basso rilievo left the table prematurely and was reported to have been very virulent about what i said so i went to my good old minister and repeated the remarks as nearly as i could remember them to him he laughed good naturedly and said there was considerable truth in them he thought he could tell when people's minds were wandering by their looks in the earlier years of his ministry he had sometimes noticed this when he was preaching very little of late years sometimes when his colleague was preaching he observed this kind of inattention but after all it was not so very unnatural i will say by the way that it is a rule i have long followed to tell my worst thoughts to my minister and my best thoughts to the young people i talk with i want to make a literary confession now which i believe nobody has made before me you know very well that i write verses sometimes because i have read some of them at this table the company assented two or three of them in a resigned sort of way as i thought as if they supposed i had an epic in my pocket and was going to read half a dozen books or so for their benefit i continued of course i write some lines or passages which are better than others some which compared with the others might be called relatively excellent it is in the nature of things that i should consider these relatively excellent lines or passages as absolutely good so much must be pardoned to humanity now i never wrote a good line in my life but the moment after it was written it seemed a hundred years old very commonly i had a sudden conviction that i had seen it somewhere possibly i may have sometimes unconsciously stolen it but i do not remember that i ever once detected any historical truth in these sudden convictions of the antiquity of my new thought or phrase i have learned utterly to distrust them and never allow them to bully me out of a thought or line this is the philosophy of it here the number of the company was diminished by a small secession any new formula which suddenly emerges in our consciousness has its roots in long trains of thought it is virtually old when it first makes its appearance among the recognized growths of our intellect any crystalline group of musical words has had a long and still period to form in here is one theory picture the schoolmistress but there is a larger law which perhaps comprehends these facts it is this the rapidity with which ideas grow old in our memories is in a direct ratio to the squares of their importance their apparent age runs up miraculously like the value of diamonds as they increase in magnitude a great calamity for instance is as old as the trilobites an hour after it has happened it stains backward through all the leaves we have turned over in the book of life before its blot of tears or of blood is dry on the page we are turning for this we seem to have lived it was foreshadowed in dreams that we leaped out of in the cold sweat of terror in the dissolving views of dark day visions all omens pointed to it all paths led to it after the tossing half forgetfulness of the first sleep that follows such an event it comes upon us afresh as a surprise at waking in a few moments it is old again old as eternity i wish i had not said all this then and there i might have known better the pale schoolmistress in her mourning dress was looking at me as i noticed with a wild sort of expression all at once the blood dropped out of her cheeks as the mercury drops from a broken barometer tube and she melted away from her seat like an image of snow a slung shot could not have brought her down better god forgive me after this little episode i continued to some few that remained balancing teaspoons on the edges of cups twirling knives or tilting upon the hind legs of their chairs until their heads reached the wall where they left gratuitous advertisements of various popular cosmetics when a person is suddenly thrust into any strange new position of trial he finds the place fits him as if he had been measured for it he has committed a great crime for instance and is sent to the state prison the traditions prescriptions limitations privileges all the sharp conditions of his new life stamp themselves upon his consciousness as the signet on soft wax a single pressure is enough let me strengthen the image a little did you ever happen to see that most soft spoken and velvet handed steam engine at the mint the smooth piston slides backward and forward as a lady might slip her delicate finger in and out of a ring the engine lays one of _its_ fingers calmly but firmly upon a bit of metal it is a coin now and will remember that touch and tell a new race about it when the date upon it is crusted over with twenty centuries so it is that a great silent moving misery puts a new stamp on us in an hour or a moment as sharp an impression as if it had taken half a lifetime to engrave it it is awful to be in the hands of the wholesale professional dealers in misfortune undertakers and jailers magnetize you in a moment and you pass out of the individual life you were living into the rhythmical movements of their horrible machinery do the worst thing you can or suffer the worst that can be thought of you find yourself in a category of humanity that stretches back as far as cain and with an expert at your elbow who has studied your case all out beforehand and is waiting for you with his implements of hemp or mahogany i believe if a man were to be burned in any of our cities tomorrow for heresy there would be found a master of ceremonies that knew just how many fagots were necessary and the best way of arranging the whole matter so we have not won the goodwood cup _au contraire_ we were a bad fifth if not worse than that and trying it again and the third time has not yet bettered the matter now i am as patriotic as any of my fellow citizens too patriotic in fact for i have got into hot water by loving too much of my country in short if any man whose fighting weight is not more than eight stone four pounds disputes it i am ready to discuss the point with him i should have gloried to see the stars and stripes in front at the finish i love my country and i love horses stubbs's old mezzotint of eclipse hangs over my desk and herring's portrait of plenipotentiary whom i saw run at epsom over my fireplace did i not elope from school to see revenge and prospect and little john and peacemaker run over the race course where now yon suburban village flourishes in the year eighteen hundred and ever so few though i never owned a horse have i not been the proprietor of six equine females of which one was the prettiest little morgin that ever stepped listen then to an opinion i have often expressed long before this venture of ours in england horse _racing_ is not a republican institution horse _trotting_ is only very rich persons can keep race horses and everybody knows they are kept mainly as gambling implements all that matter about blood and speed we won't discuss we understand all that useful very _of_ course great obligations to the godolphin arabian and the rest i say racing horses are essentially gambling implements as much as roulette tables now i am not preaching at this moment i may read you one of my sermons some other morning but i maintain that gambling on the great scale is not republican it belongs to two phases of society a cankered over civilization such as exists in rich aristocracies and the reckless life of borderers and adventurers or the semi barbarism of a civilization resolved into its primitive elements real republicanism is stern and severe its essence is not in forms of government but in the omnipotence of public opinion which grows out of it this public opinion cannot prevent"
