for all was in extremity hence it may be that the face of an old man who had like others been called to the heights by the rising flames was not really the mere nose and chin that it appeared to be but an appreciable quantity of human countenance he stood complacently sunning himself in the heat with a speaker or stake he tossed the outlying scraps of fuel into the conflagration looking at the midst of the pile occasionally lifting his eyes to measure the height of the flame or to follow the great sparks which rose with it and sailed away into darkness the beaming sight and the penetrating warmth seemed to breed in him a cumulative cheerfulness which soon amounted to delight with his stick in his hand he began to jig a private minuet a bunch of copper seals shining and swinging like a pendulum from under his waistcoat he also began to sing in the voice of a bee up a flue the king call'd down his no bles all by one by two by three earl mar shal i'll go shrive the queen and thou shalt wend with me a boon a boon quoth earl mar shal and fell on his bend ded knee that what so e'er the queen shall say no harm there of may be want of breath prevented a continuance of the song and the breakdown attracted the attention of a firm standing man of middle age who kept each corner of his crescent shaped mouth rigorously drawn back into his cheek as if to do away with any suspicion of mirthfulness which might erroneously have attached to him a fair stave grandfer cantle but i am afeard tis too much for the mouldy weasand of such a old man as you he said to the wrinkled reveller dostn't wish th wast three sixes again grandfer as you was when you first learnt to sing it hey said grandfer cantle stopping in his dance dostn't wish wast young again i say there's a hole in thy poor bellows nowadays seemingly but there's good art in me if i couldn't make a little wind go a long ways i should seem no younger than the most aged man should i timothy and how about the new married folks down there at the quiet woman inn the other inquired pointing towards a dim light in the direction of the distant highway but considerably apart from where the reddleman was at that moment resting what's the rights of the matter about em you ought to know being an understanding man but a little rakish hey i own to it master cantle is that or he's nothing yet tis a gay fault neigbbour fairway that age will cure i heard that they were coming home tonight by this time they must have come what besides the next thing is for us to go and wish em joy i suppose well no no now i thought we must i must or twould be very unlike me the first in every spree that's going do thou put on a fri ar's coat and i'll put on a no ther and we will to queen ele'anor go like fri'ar and his bro'ther i met mis'ess yeobright the young bride's aunt last night and she told me that her son clym was coming home a christmas wonderful clever a believe ah i should like to have all that's under that young man's hair well then i spoke to her in my well known merry way and she said o that what's shaped so venerable should talk like a fool that's what she said to me i don't care for her be jowned if i do and so i told her be jowned if i care for ee i said i had her there hey i rather think she had you said fairway no said grandfer cantle his countenance slightly flagging tisn't so bad as that with me seemingly tis however is it because of the wedding that clym is coming home a christmas to make a new arrangement because his mother is now left in the house alone yes yes that's it but timothy hearken to me said the grandfer earnestly though known as such a joker i be an understanding man if you catch me serious and i am serious now i can tell ee lots about the married couple yes this morning at six o'clock they went up the country to do the job and neither vell nor mark have been seen of em since though i reckon that this afternoon has brought em home again man and woman wife that is isn't it spoke like a man timothy and wasn't mis'ess yeobright wrong about me yes it will do i didn't know the two had walked together since last fall when her aunt forbad the banns how long has this new set to been in mangling then do you know humphrey yes how long said grandfer cantle smartly likewise turning to humphrey i ask that question ever since her aunt altered her mind and said she might have the man after all replied humphrey without removing his eyes from the fire he was a somewhat solemn young fellow and carried the hook and leather gloves of a furze cutter his legs by reason of that occupation being sheathed in bulging leggings as stiff as the philistine's greaves of brass that's why they went away to be married i count you see after kicking up such a nunny watch and forbidding the banns twould have made mis'ess yeobright seem foolish like to have a banging wedding in the same parish all as if she'd never gainsaid it exactly seem foolish like and that's very bad for the poor things that be so though i only guess as much to be sure said grandfer cantle still strenuously preserving a sensible bearing and mien ah well i was at church that day said fairway which was a very curious thing to happen if twasn't my name's simple said the grandfer emphatically i ha'n't been there to year and now the winter is a coming on i won't say i shall i ha'n't been these three years said humphrey for i'm so dead sleepy of a sunday and tis so terrible far to get there and when you do get there tis such a mortal poor chance that you'll be chose for up above when so many bain't that i bide at home and don't go at all i not only happened to be there said fairway with a fresh collection of emphasis but i was sitting in the same pew as mis'ess yeobright and though you may not see it as such it fairly made my blood run cold to hear her yes it is a curious thing but it made my blood run cold for i was close at her elbow the speaker looked round upon the bystanders now drawing closer to hear him with his lips gathered tighter than ever in the rigorousness of his descriptive moderation tis a serious job to have things happen to ee there said a woman behind ye are to declare it was the parson's words fairway continued and then up stood a woman at my side a touching of me well be damned if there isn't mis'ess yeobright a standing up i said to myself yes neighbours though i was in the temple of prayer that's what i said tis against my conscience to curse and swear in company and i hope any woman here will overlook it still what i did say i did say and twould be a lie if i didn't own it so twould neighbour fairway be damned if there isn't mis'ess yeobright a standing up i said the narrator repeated giving out the bad word with the same passionless severity of face as before which proved how entirely necessity and not gusto had to do with the iteration and the next thing i heard was i forbid the banns from her i'll speak to you after the service said the parson in quite a homely way yes turning all at once into a common man no holier than you or i ah her face was pale maybe you can call to mind that monument in weatherbury church the cross legged soldier that have had his arm knocked away by the schoolchildren well he would about have matched that woman's face when she said i forbid the banns the audience cleared their throats and tossed a few stalks into the fire not because these deeds were urgent but to give themselves time to weigh the moral of the story i'm sure when i heard they'd been forbid i felt as glad as if anybody had gied me sixpence said an earnest voice that of olly dowden a woman who lived by making heath brooms or besoms her nature was to be civil to enemies as well as to friends and grateful to all the world for letting her remain alive and now the maid have married him just the same said humphrey after that mis'ess yeobright came round and was quite agreeable fairway resumed with an unheeding air to show that his words were no appendage to humphrey's but the result of independent reflection supposing they were ashamed i don't see why they shouldn't have done it here right said a wide spread woman whose stays creaked like shoes whenever she stooped or turned tis well to call the neighbours together and to hae a good racket once now and then and it may as well be when there's a wedding as at tide times i don't care for close ways ah now you'd hardly believe it but i don't care for gay weddings said timothy fairway his eyes again travelling round i hardly blame thomasin yeobright and neighbour wildeve for doing it quiet if i must own it a wedding at home means five and six handed reels by the hour and they do a man's legs no good when he's over forty true once at the woman's house you can hardly say nay to being one in a jig knowing all the time that you be expected to make yourself worth your victuals you be bound to dance at christmas because tis the time o year you must dance at weddings because tis the time o life at christenings folk will even smuggle in a reel or two if tis no further on than the first or second chiel and this is not naming the songs you've got to sing for my part i like a good hearty funeral as well as anything you've as splendid victuals and drink as at other parties and even better and it don't wear your legs to stumps in talking over a poor fellow's ways as it do to stand up in hornpipes nine folks out of ten would own twas going too far to dance then i suppose suggested grandfer cantle tis the only sort of party a staid man can feel safe at after the mug have been round a few times well i can't understand a quiet ladylike little body like tamsin yeobright caring to be married in such a mean way said susan nunsuch the wide woman who preferred the original subject tis worse than the poorest do and i shouldn't have cared about the man though some may say he's good looking to give him his due he's a clever learned fellow in his way a'most as clever as clym yeobright used to be he was brought up to better things than keeping the quiet woman an engineer that's what the man was as we know but he threw away his chance and so a took a public house to live his learning was no use to him at all very often the case said olly the besom maker and yet how people do strive after it and get it the class of folk that couldn't use to make a round o to save their bones from the pit can write their names now without a sputter of the pen oftentimes without a single blot what do i say why almost without a desk to lean their stomachs and elbows upon true tis amazing what a polish the world have been brought to said humphrey why afore i went a soldier in the bang up locals as we was called in the year four chimed in grandfer cantle brightly i didn't know no more what the world was like than the commonest man among ye and now jown it all i won't say what i bain't fit for hey couldst sign the book no doubt said fairway if wast young enough to join hands with a woman again like wildeve and mis'ess tamsin which is more than humph there could do for he follows his father in learning ah humph well i can mind when i was married how i zid thy father's mark staring me in the face as i went to put down my name he and your mother were the couple married just afore we were and there stood they father's cross with arms stretched out like a great banging scarecrow what a terrible black cross that was thy father's very likeness in en to save my soul i couldn't help laughing when i zid en though all the time i was as hot as dog days what with the marrying and what with the woman a hanging to me and what with jack changley and a lot more chaps grinning at me through church window but the next moment a strawmote would have knocked me down for i called to mind that if thy father and mother had had high words once they'd been at it twenty times since they'd been man and wife and i zid myself as the next poor stunpoll to get into the same mess ah well what a day twas wildeve is older than tamsin yeobright by a good few summers a pretty maid too she is a young woman with a home must be a fool to tear her smock for a man like that the speaker a peat or turf cutter who had newly joined the group carried across his shoulder the singular heart shaped spade of large dimensions used in that species of labour and its well whetted edge gleamed like a silver bow in the beams of the fire a hundred maidens would have had him if he'd asked em said the wide woman didst ever know a man neighbour that no woman at all would marry inquired humphrey i never did said the turf cutter nor i said another nor i said grandfer cantle well now i did once said timothy fairway adding more firmness to one of his legs i did know of such a man but only once mind he gave his throat a thorough rake round as if it were the duty of every person not to be mistaken through thickness of voice yes i knew of such a man he said and what ghastly gallicrow might the poor fellow have been like master fairway asked the turf cutter well a was neither a deaf man nor a dumb man nor a blind man what a was i don't say is he known in these parts said olly dowden hardly said timothy but i name no name come keep the fire up there youngsters whatever is christian cantle's teeth a chattering for said a boy from amid the smoke and shades on the other side of the blaze be ye a cold christian a thin jibbering voice was heard to reply no not at all come forward christian and show yourself i didn't know you were here said fairway with a humane look across towards that quarter thus requested a faltering man with reedy hair no shoulders and a great quantity of wrist and ankle beyond his clothes advanced a step or two by his own will and was pushed by the will of others half a dozen steps more he was grandfer cantle's youngest son what be ye quaking for christian said the turf cutter kindly i'm the man what man the man no woman will marry the deuce you be said timothy fairway enlarging his gaze to cover christian's whole surface and a great deal more grandfer cantle meanwhile staring as a hen stares at the duck she has hatched yes i be he and it makes me afeard said christian d'ye think twill hurt me i shall always say i don't care and swear to it though i do care all the while well be damned if this isn't the queerest start ever i know'd said mr fairway i didn't mean you at all there's another in the country then why did ye reveal yer misfortune christian twas to be if twas i suppose i can't help it can i he turned upon them his painfully circular eyes surrounded by concentric lines like targets no that's true but tis a melancholy thing and my blood ran cold when you spoke for i felt there were two poor fellows where i had thought only one tis a sad thing for ye christian how'st know the women won't hae thee i've asked em sure i should never have thought you had the face well and what did the last one say to ye nothing that can't be got over perhaps after all get out of my sight you slack twisted slim looking maphrotight fool was the woman's words to me not encouraging i own said fairway get out of my sight you slack twisted slim looking maphrotight fool is rather a hard way of saying no but even that might be overcome by time and patience so as to let a few grey hairs show themselves in the hussy's head how old be you christian thirty one last tatie digging mister fairway not a boy not a boy still there's hope yet that's my age by baptism because that's put down in the great book of the judgment that they keep in church vestry but mother told me i was born some time afore i was christened ah but she couldn't tell when to save her life except that there was no moon no moon that's bad hey neighbours that's bad for him yes tis bad said grandfer cantle shaking his head mother know'd twas no moon for she asked another woman that had an almanac as she did whenever a boy was born to her because of the saying no moon no man which made her afeard every man child she had do ye really think it serious mister fairway that there was no moon yes no moon no man tis one of the truest sayings ever spit out the boy never comes to anything that's born at new moon a bad job for thee christian that you should have showed your nose then of all days in the month i suppose the moon was terrible full when you were born said christian with a look of hopeless admiration at fairway well a was not new mr fairway replied with a disinterested gaze i'd sooner go without drink at lammas tide than be a man of no moon continued christian in the same shattered recitative tis said i be only the rames of a man and no good for my race at all and i suppose that's the cause o't ay said grandfer cantle somewhat subdued in spirit and yet his mother cried for scores of hours when a was a boy for fear he should outgrow hisself and go for a soldier well there's many just as bad as he said fairway wethers must live their time as well as other sheep poor soul so perhaps i shall rub on ought i to be afeared o nights master fairway you'll have to lie alone all your life and tis not to married couples but to single sleepers that a ghost shows himself when a do come one has been seen lately too a very strange one no don't talk about it if tis agreeable of ye not to twill make my skin crawl when i think of it in bed alone but you will ah you will i know timothy and i shall dream all night o't a very strange one what sort of a spirit did ye mean when ye said a very strange one timothy no no don't tell me i don't half believe in spirits myself but i think it ghostly enough what i was told twas a little boy that zid it what was it like no don't a red one yes most ghosts be white but this is as if it had been dipped in blood christian drew a deep breath without letting it expand his body and humphrey said where has it been seen not exactly here but in this same heth but tisn't a thing to talk about what do ye say continued fairway in brisker tones and turning upon them as if the idea had not been grandfer cantle's what do you say to giving the new man and wife a bit of a song tonight afore we go to bed being their wedding day when folks are just married tis as well to look glad o't since looking sorry won't unjoin em i am no drinker as we know but when the womenfolk and youngsters have gone home we can drop down across to the quiet woman and strike up a ballet in front of the married folks door twill please the young wife and that's what i should like to do for many's the skinful i've had at her hands when she lived with her aunt at blooms end hey and so we will said grandfer cantle turning so briskly that his copper seals swung extravagantly i'm as dry as a kex with biding up here in the wind and i haven't seen the colour of drink since nammet time today tis said that the last brew at the woman is very pretty drinking and neighbours if we should be a little late in the finishing why tomorrow's sunday and we can sleep it off grandfer cantle you take things very careless for an old man said the wide woman i take things careless i do too careless to please the women klk i'll sing the jovial crew or any other song when a weak old man would cry his eyes out jown it i am up for anything the king look'd o ver his left shoul der and a grim look look ed hee earl mar shal he said but for my oath or hang ed thou shouldst bee well that's what we'll do said fairway we'll give em a song an it please the lord what's the good of thomasin's cousin clym a coming home after the deed's done he should have come afore if so be he wanted to stop it and marry her himself perhaps he's coming to bide with his mother a little time as she must feel lonely now the maid's gone now tis very odd but i never feel lonely no not at all said grandfer cantle i am as brave in the nighttime as a admiral the bonfire was by this time beginning to sink low for the fuel had not been of that substantial sort which can support a blaze long most of the other fires within the wide horizon were also dwindling weak attentive observation of their brightness colour and length of existence would have revealed the quality of the material burnt and through that to some extent the natural produce of the district in which each bonfire was situate the clear kingly effulgence that had characterized the majority expressed a heath and furze country like their own which in one direction extended an unlimited number of miles the rapid flares and extinctions at other points of the compass showed the lightest of fuel straw beanstalks and the usual waste from arable land the most enduring of all steady unaltering eyes like planets signified wood such as hazel branches thorn faggots and stout billets fires of the last mentioned materials were rare and though comparatively small in magnitude beside the transient blazes now began to get the best of them by mere long continuance the great ones had perished but these remained they occupied the remotest visible positions sky backed summits rising out of rich coppice and plantation districts to the north where the soil was different and heath foreign and strange save one and this was the nearest of any the moon of the whole shining throng it lay in a direction precisely opposite to that of the little window in the vale below its nearness was such that notwithstanding its actual smallness its glow infinitely transcended theirs this quiet eye had attracted attention from time to time and when their own fire had become sunken and dim it attracted more some even of the wood fires more recently lighted had reached their decline but no change was perceptible here to be sure how near that fire is said fairway seemingly i can see a fellow of some sort walking round it little and good must be said of that fire surely i can throw a stone there said the boy and so can i said grandfer cantle no no you can't my sonnies that fire is not much less than a mile off for all that a seems so near tis in the heath but no furze said the turf cutter tis cleft wood that's what tis said timothy fairway nothing would burn like that except clean timber and tis on the knap afore the old captain's house at mistover such a queer mortal as that man is to have a little fire inside your own bank and ditch that nobody else may enjoy it or come anigh it and what a zany an old chap must be to light a bonfire when there's no youngsters to please cap'n vye has been for a long walk today and is quite tired out said grandfer cantle so tisn't likely to be he and he would hardly afford good fuel like that said the wide woman then it must be his granddaughter said fairway not that a body of her age can want a fire much she is very strange in her ways living up there by herself and such things please her said susan she's a well favoured maid enough said humphrey the furze cutter especially when she's got one of her dandy gowns on that's true said fairway well let her bonfire burn an't will ours is well nigh out by the look o't how dark tis now the fire's gone down said christian cantle looking behind him with his hare eyes don't ye think we'd better get home along neighbours the heth isn't haunted i know but we'd better get home ah what was that only the wind said the turf cutter i don't think fifth of novembers ought to be kept up by night except in towns it should be by day in outstep ill accounted places like this nonsense christian lift up your spirits like a man susy dear you and i will have a jig hey my honey before tis quite too dark to see how well favoured you be still though so many summers have passed since your husband a son of a witch snapped you up from me this was addressed to susan nunsuch and the next circumstance of which the beholders were conscious was a vision of the matron's broad form whisking off towards the space whereon the fire had been kindled she was lifted bodily by mr fairway's arm which had been flung round her waist before she had become aware of his intention the site of the fire was now merely a circle of ashes flecked with red embers and sparks the furze having burnt completely away once within the circle he whirled her round and round in a dance she was a woman noisily constructed in addition to her enclosing framework of whalebone and lath she wore pattens summer and winter in wet weather and in dry to preserve her boots from wear and when fairway began to jump about with her the clicking of the pattens the creaking of the stays and her screams of surprise formed a very audible concert i'll crack thy numskull for thee you mandy chap said mrs nunsuch as she helplessly danced round with him her feet playing like drumsticks among the sparks my ankles were all in a fever before from walking through that prickly furze and now you must make em worse with these vlankers the vagary of timothy fairway was infectious the turf cutter seized old olly dowden and somewhat more gently poussetted with her likewise the young men were not slow to imitate the example of their elders and seized the maids grandfer cantle and his stick jigged in the form of a three legged object among the rest and in half a minute all that could be seen on rainbarrow was a whirling of dark shapes amid a boiling confusion of sparks which leapt around the dancers as high as their waists the chief noises were women's shrill cries men's laughter susan's stays and pattens olly dowden's heu heu heu and the strumming of the wind upon the furze"
