"1" "about to take what luncheon repeated zoie trying apparently to conceal her disgust at his dulness our luncheon yesterday why did you lie asked jimmy his eyes growing rounder and rounder with wonder i didn't know he knew answered zoie innocently knew what questioned jimmy more and more befogged that i'd eaten with a man concluded zoie impatiently then she turned her back upon jimmy and again dashed up and down the room occupied with her own thoughts it was certainly difficult to get much understanding out of zoie's disjointed observations but jimmy was doing his best he followed her restless movements about the room with his eyes and then ventured a timid comment he couldn't object to your eating with me oh couldn't he cried zoie and she turned upon him with a look of contempt if there's anything that he doesn't object to she continued i haven't found it out yet and with that she threw herself in a large arm chair near the table and left jimmy to draw his own conclusions jimmy looked about the room as though expecting aid from some unseen source then his eyes sought the floor eventually they crept to the tip of zoie's tiny slipper as it beat a nervous tattoo on the rug to save his immortal soul jimmy could never help being hypnotised by zoie's small feet he wondered now if they had been the reason of alfred's first downfall he recalled with a sigh of relief that aggie's feet were large and reassuring he also recalled an appropriate quotation the path of virtue is not for women with small feet it ran yes aggie's feet are undoubtedly large he concluded but all this was not solving zoie's immediate problem and an impatient cough from her made him realise that something was expected of him why did you lunch with me he asked with a touch of irritation if you thought he wouldn't like it i was hungry snapped zoie oh grunted jimmy and in spite of his dislike of the small creature his vanity resented the bald assertion that she had not lunched with him for his company's sake i wouldn't have made an engagement with you of course she continued with a frankness that vanquished any remaining conceit that jimmy might have brought with him i explained to you how it was at the time it was merely a case of convenience you know that jimmy was beginning to see it more and more in the light of an inconvenience if you hadn't been in front of that horrid old restaurant just when i was passing she continued all this would never have happened but you were there and you asked me to come in and have a bite with you and i did and there you are yes there i am assented jimmy dismally there was no doubt about where he was now but where was he going to end that was the question see here he exclaimed with fast growing uneasiness i don't like being mixed up in this sort of thing of course you'd think of yourself first sneered zoie that's just like a man well i don't want to get your husband down on me argued jimmy evasively oh i didn't give you away sneered zoie you needn't worry and she fixed her eyes upon him with a scornful expression that left no doubt as to her opinion that he was a craven coward but you said he'd found out stammered jimmy he's found out that i ate with a man answered zoie more and more aggrieved at having to employ so much detail in the midst of her distress he doesn't know it was you but zoie protested jimmy she lifted a small hand begging him to spare her further questions it was apparent that she must explain each aspect of their present difficulty with as much patience as though jimmy were in reality only a child she sank into her chair and then proceeded with a martyred air you see it was like this she said alfred came into the restaurant just after we had gone out and henri the waiter who has taken care of him for years told him that i had just been in to luncheon with a gentleman jimmy shifted about on the edge of his chair ill at ease now if alfred had only told me that in the first place she continued i'd have known what to say but he didn't oh no he was as sweet as could be all through breakfast and last night too and then just as he was leaving this morning i said something about luncheon and he said quite casually where did you have luncheon yesterday my dear so i answered quite carelessly i had none my love well i wish you could have seen him he called me dreadful things he says i'm the one thing he can't endure what's that questioned jimmy wondering how alfred could confine himself to any one thing he says i'm a liar shrieked zoie tearfully well aren't you asked jimmy of course i am declared zoie but why shouldn't i be she looked at jimmy with such an air of self approval that for the life of him he could find no reason to offer you know how jealous alfred is she continued he makes such a fuss about the slightest thing that i've got out of the habit of ever telling the truth she walked away from jimmy as though dismissing the entire matter he shifted his position uneasily she turned to him again with mock sweetness i suppose you told aggie all about it she said jimmy's round eyes opened wide and his jaw dropped lower i i don't believe i did he stammered weakly i didn't think of it again thank heaven for that concluded zoie with tightly pressed lips then she knotted her small white brow in deep thought jimmy regarded her with growing uneasiness what are you up to now he asked i don't know yet mused zoie but you're not going to tell aggie that's one sure thing and she pinned him down with her eyes i certainly will tell her asserted jimmy with a wag of his very round head aggie is just the one to get you out of this she's just the one to make things worse said zoie decidedly then seeing jimmy's hurt look she continued apologetically aggie means all right but she has an absolute mania for mixing up in other people's troubles and you know how that always ends i never deceived my wife in all my life declared jimmy with an air of self approval that he was far from feeling now jimmy protested zoie impatiently you aren't going to have moral hydrophobia just when i need your help i'm not going to lie to aggie if that's what you mean said jimmy endeavouring not to wriggle under zoie's disapproving gaze then don't answered zoie sweetly jimmy never feared zoie more than when she appeared to agree with him he looked at her now with uneasy distrust tell her the truth urged zoie i will declared jimmy with an emphatic nod and i'll deny it concluded zoie with an impudent toss of her head what exclaimed jimmy and he felt himself getting onto his feet i've already denied it to alfred continued zoie i told him i'd never been in that restaurant without him in all my life that the waiter had mistaken someone else for me and again she turned her back upon jimmy but don't you see protested jimmy this would all be so very much simpler if you'd just own up to the truth now before it's too late it is too late declared zoie alfred wouldn't believe me now whatever i told him he says a woman who lies once lies all the time he'd think i'd been carrying on with you all along good lord groaned jimmy as the full realisation of his predicament thrust itself upon him we don't dare tell him now continued zoie elated by the demoralised state to which she was fast reducing him for heaven's sake don't make it any worse she concluded it's bad enough as it is it certainly is agreed jimmy and he sank dejectedly into his chair if you do tell him threatened zoie from the opposite side of the table i'll say you enticed me into the place what shrieked jimmy and again he found himself on his feet i will insisted zoie i give you fair warning he stared at her in absolute horror i don't believe you've any conscience at all he said i haven't she sniffled i'm too miserable and throwing herself into the nearest armchair she wept copiously at the thought of her many injuries uncertain whether to fly or to remain jimmy gazed at her gloomily well i'm not laughing myself to death he said for answer zoie turned upon him vehemently i just wish i'd never laid eyes on you jimmy she cried jimmy was wishing the very same thing if i cared about you she sobbed it wouldn't be so bad but to think of losing my alfred for words failed her and she trailed off weakly for nothing thanks grunted jimmy curtly in spite of himself he was always miffed by the uncomplimentary way in which she disposed of him his sarcasm was lost upon zoie having finished all she had to say to him she was now apparently bent upon indulging herself in a first class fit of hysterics there are critical moments in all of our lives when our future happiness or woe hangs upon our own decision jimmy felt intuitively that he was face to face with such a moment but which way to turn that was the question being jimmy and soft hearted in spite of his efforts to conceal it he naturally turned the wrong way in other words towards zoie oh come now he said awkwardly as he crossed to the arm of her chair this will soon blow over zoie only sobbed the louder this isn't the first time you and alfred have called it all off he reminded her again she sobbed jimmy could never remember quite how it happened but apparently he must have patted zoie on the shoulder at any rate something or other loosened the flood gates of her emotion and before jimmy could possibly escape from her vicinity she had wheeled round in her chair thrown her arms about him and buried her tear stained face against his waist coat good lord exclaimed jimmy for the third time that morning as he glanced nervously toward the door but zoie was exclaiming in her own way and sobbing louder and louder furthermore she was compelling jimmy to listen to an exaggerated account of her many disappointments in her unreasonable husband seeing no possibility of escape without resorting to physical violence jimmy stood his ground wondering what to expect next he did not have long to wonder chapter v within an hour from the time alfred had entered his office that morning he was leaving it in a taxi with his faithful secretary at his side and his important papers in a bag at his feet take me to the sherwood he commanded the driver and be quick as they neared alfred's house johnson could feel waves of increasing anger circling around his perturbed young employer and later when they alighted from the taxi it was with the greatest difficulty that he could keep pace with him unfortunately for jimmy the outer door of the hardy apartment had been left ajar and thus it was that he was suddenly startled from zoie's unwelcome embraces by a sharp exclamation so cried alfred and he brought his fist down with emphasis on the centre table at jimmy's back wheeling about jimmy beheld his friend face to face with him alfred's lips were pressed tightly together his eyes flashing fire it was apparent that he desired an immediate explanation jimmy turned to the place where zoie had been to ask for help like the traitress that she was he now saw her flying through her bedroom door again he glanced at alfred who was standing like a sentry waiting for the pass word that should restore his confidence in his friend i'm afraid i've disturbed you sneered alfred oh no not at all answered jimmy affecting a careless indifference that he did not feel and unconsciously shaking hands with the waiting secretary reminded of the secretary's presence in such a distinctly family scene alfred turned to him with annoyance go into my study he said i'll be with you presently here's your list he added and he thrust a long memorandum into the secretary's hand johnson retired as unobtrusively as possible and the two old friends were left alone there was another embarrassed silence which jimmy at least seemed powerless to break well questioned alfred in a threatening tone tolerably well answered jimmy in his most pleasant but slightly nervous manner then followed another pause in which alfred continued to eye his old friend with grave suspicion the fact is stammered jimmy i just came over to bring aggie he corrected himself that is to bring zoie a little message from aggie it seemed to be a sad one answered alfred with a sarcastic smile as he recalled the picture of zoie weeping upon his friend's sleeve oh no no answered jimmy with an elaborate attempt at carelessness do you generally play the messenger during business hours thundered alfred becoming more and more enraged at jimmy's petty evasions just sometimes answered jimmy persisting in his amiable manner jimmy said alfred and there was a solemn warning in his voice don't you lie to me jimmy started as though shot the consciousness of his guilt was strong upon him i beg your pardon he gasped for the want of anything more intelligent to say you don't do it well continued alfred and you and i are old friends jimmy's round eyes fixed themselves on the carpet my wife has been telling you her troubles surmised alfred jimmy tried to protest but the lie would not come very well continued alfred i'll tell you something too i've done with her he thrust his hands in his pockets and began to walk up and down what a turbulent household thought jimmy and then he set out in pursuit of his friend i'm sorry you've had a misunderstanding he began misunderstanding shouted alfred turning upon him so sharply that he nearly tripped him up we've never had anything else there was never anything else for us to have she's lied up hill and down dale from the first time she clinched her baby fingers around my hand he imitated zoie's dainty manner and said pleased to meet you but i've caught her with the goods this time he shouted and i've just about got him him echoed jimmy weakly the wife stealer exclaimed alfred and he clinched his fists in anticipation of the justice he would one day mete out to the despicable creature now jimmy had been called many things in his time he realised that he would doubtless be called many more things in the future but never by the wildest stretch of imagination had he ever conceived of himself in the role of wife stealer mistaking jimmy's look of amazement for one of incredulity alfred endeavoured to convince him oh you'll meet a wife stealer sooner or later he assured him you needn't look so horrified jimmy only stared at him and he continued excitedly she's had the effrontery the bad taste the idiocy to lunch in a public restaurant with the blackguard the mere sound of the word made jimmy shudder but engrossed in his own troubles alfred continued without heeding him henri the head waiter told me explained alfred and jimmy remembered guiltily that he had been very bumptious with the fellow you know the place continued alfred the lasalle a restaurant where i am known where she is known where my best friends dine where henri has looked after me for years that shows how desperate she is she must be mad about the fool she's lost all sense of decency and again alfred paced the floor oh i wouldn't go as far as that stammered jimmy oh wouldn't you cried alfred again turning so abruptly that jimmy caught his breath each word of jimmy's was apparently goading him on to greater anger now don't get hasty jimmy almost pleaded the whole thing is no doubt perfectly innocent talk to her gently win her confidence get her to tell you the truth the truth shouted alfred in derision zoie the truth jimmy feared that his young friend might actually become violent alfred bore down upon him like a maniac the truth he repeated wildly she wouldn't know the truth if she saw it under a microscope she's the most unconscionable little liar that ever lured a man to the altar jimmy rolled his round eyes with feigned incredulity i found it out before we'd been married a month continued alfred she used to sit evenings facing the clock i sat with my back to it i used to ask her the time invariably she would lie half an hour backward or forward just for practice that was the beginning here listen to some of these he added as he drew half a dozen telegrams from his inner pocket and motioned jimmy to sit at the opposite side of the table jimmy would have preferred to stand but it was not a propitious time to consult his own preferences he allowed himself to be bullied into the chair that alfred suggested throwing himself into the opposite chair alfred selected various exhibits from his collection of messages i just brought these up from the office he said these are some of the telegrams that she sent me each day last week while i was away this is monday's and he proceeded to read with a sneering imitation of zoie's cloy sweetness darling so lonesome without you cried all day when are you coming home to your wee sad wifie love and kisses zoie tearing the defenceless telegram into bits alfred threw it from him and waited for his friend's verdict she sent that over the wire gasped jimmy oh that's nothing answered alfred that's a mild one and he selected another from the same pocket here listen to this this is what she really did this is from my secretary the same night you spied upon her asked jimmy feeling more and more convinced that his own deceptions would certainly be run to earth i have to spy upon her answered alfred in self defence it's the only way i can keep her from making me utterly ridiculous and he proceeded to read from the secretary's telegram shopped all morning lunched at martingale's with man and woman unknown to me martingale's he repeated with a sneer motored through park with mrs wilmer until five mrs wilmer he exclaimed there's a woman i've positively forbidden her to speak to jimmy only shook his head and alfred continued to read had tea with mr and mrs thompson and young ardesley at the park view ardesley is a young cub explained alfred who spends his time running around with married women while their husbands are away trying to make a living for them shocking was the extent of jimmy's comment and alfred resumed reading dinner and theatre same party supper at wellingford home two a m he looked at jimmy expecting to hear zoie bitterly condemned jimmy only stared at him blankly that's pretty good commented alfred for the woman who cried all day isn't it still jimmy made no answer and alfred brought his fist down upon the table impatiently isn't it he repeated she was a bit busy that day admitted jimmy uneasily the truth cried alfred again as he rose and paced about excitedly getting the truth out of zoie is like going to a fire in the night you think it's near but you never get there and when she begins by saying that she's going to tell you the real truth he threw up his hands in despair well then it's time to leave home chapter vi there was another pause then alfred drew in his breath and bore down upon jimmy with fresh vehemence the only time i get even a semblance of truth out of zoie he cried is when i catch her red handed again he pounded the table and again jimmy winced and even then he continued she colours it so with her affected innocence and her plea about just wishing to be a good fellow that she almost makes me doubt my own eyes she is an artist he declared with a touch of enforced admiration there's no use talking that woman is an artist what are you going to do asked jimmy for the want of anything better to say i am going to leave her declared alfred emphatically i am going away a faint hope lit jimmy's round childlike face with alfred away there would be no further investigation of the luncheon incident that might be a good idea he said it's the idea said alfred most of my business is in detroit anyhow i'm going to make that my headquarters and stay there jimmy was almost smiling as for zoie continued alfred she can stay right here and go as far as she likes not with me thought jimmy but shrieked alfred with renewed emphasis i'm going to find out who the fellow is i'll have that satisfaction jimmy's spirits fell henri knows the head waiter of every restaurant in this town said alfred that is every one where she'd be likely to go and he says he'd recognise the man she lunched with if he saw him again jimmy's features became suddenly distorted the minute she appears anywhere with anybody explained alfred henri will be notified by phone he'll identify the man and then he'll wire me what good will that do asked jimmy weakly i'll take the first train home declared alfred for what questioned jimmy to shoot him exclaimed alfred what gasped jimmy almost losing his footing alfred mistook jimmy's concern for anxiety on his behalf oh i'll be acquitted he declared don't you worry i'll get my tale of woe before the jury but i say protested jimmy too uneasy to longer conceal his real emotions why kill this one particular chap when there are so many others he's the only one she's ever lunched with alone said alfred she's been giddy but at least she's always been chaperoned except with him he's the one all right there's no doubt about it he's the beginning of the end his own end yes assented jimmy half to himself now see here old man he argued i'd give that poor devil a chance to explain explain shouted alfred so sharply that jimmy quickly retreated i wouldn't believe him now if he were one of the twelve apostles that's tough murmured jimmy as he saw the last avenue of honourable escape closed to him tough roared alfred thinking of himself hah on the apostles i mean explained jimmy nervously again alfred paced up and down the room and again jimmy tried to think of some way to escape from his present difficulty it was quite apparent that his only hope lay not in his own candor but in alfred's absence how long do you expect to be away he asked only until i hear from henri said alfred henri repeated jimmy and again a gleam of hope shone on his dull features he had heard that waiters were often to be bribed nice fellow henri he ventured cautiously gets a large salary no doubt does he exclaimed alfred with a certain pride of proprietorship no tips could touch henri no indeed he's not that sort of a person again the hope faded from jimmy's round face i look upon henri as my friend continued alfred enthusiastically he speaks every language known to man he's been in every country in the world henri understands life lots of people understand life commented jimmy dismally but some people don't appreciate it they value it too lightly to my way of thinking ah but you have something to live for argued alfred i have indeed a great deal agreed jimmy more and more abused at the thought of what he was about to lose ah that's different exclaimed alfred but what have _i_ jimmy was in no frame of mind to consider his young friend's assets he was thinking of his own difficulties i'm a laughing stock shouted alfred i know it a good thing who gives his wife everything she asks for while she is running around with with my best friend for all i know oh no no protested jimmy nervously i wouldn't say that even if she weren't running around continued alfred excitedly without heeding his friend's interruption what have we to look forward to what have we to look backward to again jimmy's face was a blank alfred answered his own question by lifting his arms tragically toward heaven one eternal round of wrangles and rows a childless home do you think she wants babies he cried wheeling about on jimmy and daring him to answer in the affirmative oh no he sneered all she wants is a good time well mumbled jimmy i can't see much in babies myself fat little red worms alfred's breath went from him in astonishment weren't you ever a fat little red worm he hissed wasn't _i_ ever a little fat red he paused in confusion as his ear became puzzled by the proper sequence of his adjectives a fat red little worm he stammered and see what we are now he thrust out his chest and strutted about in great pride big red worms admitted jimmy gloomily but alfred did not hear him you and i ought to have sons on the way to what we are he declared and better oh yes better agreed jimmy thinking of his present plight much better but have we demanded alfred jimmy glanced about the room as though expecting an answering demonstration from the ceiling have you persisted alfred jimmy shook his head solemnly have _i_ asked the irate husband out of sheer absent mindedness jimmy shrugged his shoulders as usual alfred answered his own question oh no he raged you have a wife who spends her time and money gadding about with jimmy's face showed a new alarm my wife concluded alfred jimmy breathed a sigh of relief i have a wife said alfred who spends her time and my money gadding around with god knows whom but i'll catch him he cried with new fury here he said pulling a roll of bills from his pocket i'll bet you i'll catch him how much do you want to bet undesirous of offering any added inducements toward his own capture jimmy backed away both literally and figuratively from alfred's proposition what's the use of getting so excited he asked mistaking jimmy's unwillingness to bet for a disinclination to take advantage of a friend's reckless mood alfred resented the implied insult to his astuteness you think i can't catch him he exclaimed let's see the colour of your money he demanded but before jimmy could comply an unexpected voice broke into the argument and brought them both round with a start chapter vii good heavens exclaimed aggie who had entered the room while alfred was talking his loudest what a racket her eyes fell upon jimmy who was teetering about uneasily just behind alfred she stared at him in amazement was it possible that jimmy the methodical had left his office at this hour of the morning and for what avoiding the question in aggie's eyes jimmy pretended to be searching for his pocket handkerchief but always with the vision of aggie in her new fall gown and her large picture hat at his elbow never before had she appeared so beautiful to him so desirable suppose he should lose her life spread before him as a dreary waste he tried to look up at her he could not he feared she would read his guilt in his eyes what guilt he asked himself there was no longer any denying the fact a secret had sprung up between them annoyed at receiving no greeting aggie continued in a rather hurt voice aren't you two going to speak to me alfred swallowed hard in an effort to regain his composure good morning he said curtly fully convinced of a disagreement between the two old friends aggie addressed herself in a reproachful tone to jimmy my dear she said what are you doing here this time of day jimmy felt alfred's steely eyes upon him why he stammered why i just came over to bring your message my message repeated aggie in perplexity what message alfred's eyebrows drew themselves sharply together jimmy had told so many lies this morning that another more or less could not matter moreover this was not a time to hesitate why the message you sent to zoie he answered boldly but i sent no message to zoie said aggie what thundered alfred so loud that aggie's fingers involuntarily went to her ears she was more and more puzzled by the odd behaviour of the two i mean yesterday's message corrected jimmy and he assumed an aggrieved air toward aggie you villain exclaimed aggie i told you to phone her yesterday morning from"
