the whole city within the walls and but nineteen in southwark lambeth parish included whereas in the parishes of st giles and st martin in the fields alone there died 421 but we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out parishes which being very populous and fuller also of poor the distemper found more to prey upon than in the city as i shall observe afterwards we perceived i say the distemper to draw our way viz by the parishes of clarkenwell cripplegate shoreditch and bishopsgate which last two parishes joining to aldgate whitechappel and stepney the infection came at length to spread its utmost rage and violence in those parts even when it abated at the western parishes where it began it was very strange to observe that in this particular week from the 4th to the 11th of july when as i have observed there died near 400 of the plague in the two parishes of st martin and st giles in the fields only there died in the parish of aldgate but four in the parish of whitechappel three in the parish of stepney but one likewise in the next week from the 11th of july to the 18th when the week's bill was 1761 yet there died no more of the plague on the whole southwark side of the water than sixteen but this face of things soon changed and it began to thicken in cripplegate parish especially and in clarkenwell so that by the second week in august cripplegate parish alone buried 886 and clarkenwell 155 of the first 850 might well be reckoned to die of the plague and of the last the bill itself said 145 were of the plague during the month of july and while as i have observed our part of the town seemed to be spared in comparison of the west part i went ordinarily about the streets as my business required and particularly went generally once in a day or in two days into the city to my brother's house which he had given me charge of and to see if it was safe and having the key in my pocket i used to go into the house and over most of the rooms to see that all was well for though it be something wonderful to tell that any should have hearts so hardened in the midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal yet certain it is that all sorts of villainies and even levities and debaucheries were then practised in the town as openly as ever i will not say quite as frequently because the numbers of people were many ways lessened but the city itself began now to be visited too i mean within the walls but the number of people there were indeed extremely lessened by so great a multitude having been gone into the country and even all this month of july they continued to flee though not in such multitudes as formerly in august indeed they fled in such a manner that i began to think there would be really none but magistrates and servants left in the city as they fled now out of the city so i should observe that the court removed early viz in the month of june and went to oxford where it pleased god to preserve them and the distemper did not as i heard of so much as touch them for which i cannot say that i ever saw they showed any great token of thankfulness and hardly anything of reformation though they did not want being told that their crying vices might without breach of charity be said to have gone far in bringing that terrible judgement upon the whole nation the face of london was now indeed strangely altered i mean the whole mass of buildings city liberties suburbs westminster southwark and altogether for as to the particular part called the city or within the walls that was not yet much infected but in the whole the face of things i say was much altered sorrow and sadness sat upon every face and though some parts were not yet overwhelmed yet all looked deeply concerned and as we saw it apparently coming on so every one looked on himself and his family as in the utmost danger were it possible to represent those times exactly to those that did not see them and give the reader due ideas of the horror that everywhere presented itself it must make just impressions upon their minds and fill them with surprise london might well be said to be all in tears the mourners did not go about the streets indeed for nobody put on black or made a formal dress of mourning for their nearest friends but the voice of mourners was truly heard in the streets the shrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their houses where their dearest relations were perhaps dying or just dead were so frequent to be heard as we passed the streets that it was enough to pierce the stoutest heart in the world to hear them tears and lamentations were seen almost in every house especially in the first part of the visitation for towards the latter end men's hearts were hardened and death was so always before their eyes that they did not so much concern themselves for the loss of their friends expecting that themselves should be summoned the next hour business led me out sometimes to the other end of the town even when the sickness was chiefly there and as the thing was new to me as well as to everybody else it was a most surprising thing to see those streets which were usually so thronged now grown desolate and so few people to be seen in them that if i had been a stranger and at a loss for my way i might sometimes have gone the length of a whole street i mean of the by streets and seen nobody to direct me except watchmen set at the doors of such houses as were shut up of which i shall speak presently one day being at that part of the town on some special business curiosity led me to observe things more than usually and indeed i walked a great way where i had no business i went up holborn and there the street was full of people but they walked in the middle of the great street neither on one side or other because as i suppose they would not mingle with anybody that came out of houses or meet with smells and scent from houses that might be infected the inns of court were all shut up nor were very many of the lawyers in the temple or lincoln's inn or gray's inn to be seen there everybody was at peace there was no occasion for lawyers besides it being in the time of the vacation too they were generally gone into the country whole rows of houses in some places were shut close up the inhabitants all fled and only a watchman or two left when i speak of rows of houses being shut up i do not mean shut up by the magistrates but that great numbers of persons followed the court by the necessity of their employments and other dependences and as others retired really frighted with the distemper it was a mere desolating of some of the streets but the fright was not yet near so great in the city abstractly so called and particularly because though they were at first in a most inexpressible consternation yet as i have observed that the distemper intermitted often at first so they were as it were alarmed and unalarmed again and this several times till it began to be familiar to them and that even when it appeared violent yet seeing it did not presently spread into the city or the east and south parts the people began to take courage and to be as i may say a little hardened it is true a vast many people fled as i have observed yet they were chiefly from the west end of the town and from that we call the heart of the city that is to say among the wealthiest of the people and such people as were unencumbered with trades and business but of the rest the generality stayed and seemed to abide the worst so that in the place we calf the liberties and in the suburbs in southwark and in the east part such as wapping ratcliff stepney rotherhithe and the like the people generally stayed except here and there a few wealthy families who as above did not depend upon their business it must not be forgot here that the city and suburbs were prodigiously full of people at the time of this visitation i mean at the time that it began for though i have lived to see a further increase and mighty throngs of people settling in london more than ever yet we had always a notion that the numbers of people which the wars being over the armies disbanded and the royal family and the monarchy being restored had flocked to london to settle in business or to depend upon and attend the court for rewards of services preferments and the like was such that the town was computed to have in it above a hundred thousand people more than ever it held before nay some took upon them to say it had twice as many because all the ruined families of the royal party flocked hither all the old soldiers set up trades here and abundance of families settled here again the court brought with them a great flux of pride and new fashions all people were grown gay and luxurious and the joy of the restoration had brought a vast many families to london i often thought that as jerusalem was besieged by the romans when the jews were assembled together to celebrate the passover by which means an incredible number of people were surprised there who would otherwise have been in other countries so the plague entered london when an incredible increase of people had happened occasionally by the particular circumstances above named as this conflux of the people to a youthful and gay court made a great trade in the city especially in everything that belonged to fashion and finery so it drew by consequence a great number of workmen manufacturers and the like being mostly poor people who depended upon their labour and i remember in particular that in a representation to my lord mayor of the condition of the poor it was estimated that there were no less than an hundred thousand riband weavers in and about the city the chiefest number of whom lived then in the parishes of shoreditch stepney whitechappel and bishopsgate that namely about spitalfields that is to say as spitalfields was then for it was not so large as now by one fifth part by this however the number of people in the whole may be judged of and indeed i often wondered that after the prodigious numbers of people that went away at first there was yet so great a multitude left as it appeared there was but i must go back again to the beginning of this surprising time while the fears of the people were young they were increased strangely by several odd accidents which put altogether it was really a wonder the whole body of the people did not rise as one man and abandon their dwellings leaving the place as a space of ground designed by heaven for an akeldama doomed to be destroyed from the face of the earth and that all that would be found in it would perish with it i shall name but a few of these things but sure they were so many and so many wizards and cunning people propagating them that i have often wondered there was any women especially left behind in the first place a blazing star or comet appeared for several months before the plague as there did the year after another a little before the fire the old women and the phlegmatic hypochondriac part of the other sex whom i could almost call old women too remarked especially afterward though not till both those judgements were over that those two comets passed directly over the city and that so very near the houses that it was plain they imported something peculiar to the city alone that the comet before the pestilence was of a faint dull languid colour and its motion very heavy solemn and slow but that the comet before the fire was bright and sparkling or as others said flaming and its motion swift and furious and that accordingly one foretold a heavy judgement slow but severe terrible and frightful as was the plague but the other foretold a stroke sudden swift and fiery as the conflagration nay so particular some people were that as they looked upon that comet preceding the fire they fancied that they not only saw it pass swiftly and fiercely and could perceive the motion with their eye but even they heard it that it made a rushing mighty noise fierce and terrible though at a distance and but just perceivable i saw both these stars and i must confess had so much of the common notion of such things in my head that i was apt to look upon them as the forerunners and warnings of god's judgements and especially when after the plague had followed the first i yet saw another of the like kind i could not but say god had not yet sufficiently scourged the city but i could not at the same time carry these things to the height that others did knowing too that natural causes are assigned by the astronomers for such things and that their motions and even their revolutions are calculated or pretended to be calculated so that they cannot be so perfectly called the forerunners or foretellers much less the procurers of such events as pestilence war fire and the like but let my thoughts and the thoughts of the philosophers be or have been what they will these things had a more than ordinary influence upon the minds of the common people and they had almost universal melancholy apprehensions of some dreadful calamity and judgement coming upon the city and this principally from the sight of this comet and the little alarm that was given in december by two people dying at st giles's as above the apprehensions of the people were likewise strangely increased by the error of the times in which i think the people from what principle i cannot imagine were more addicted to prophecies and astrological conjurations dreams and old wives tales than ever they were before or since whether this unhappy temper was originally raised by the follies of some people who got money by it that is to say by printing predictions and prognostications i know not but certain it is books frighted them terribly such as lilly's almanack gadbury's astrological predictions poor robin's almanack and the like also several pretended religious books one entitled come out of her my people lest you be partaker of her plagues another called fair warning another britain's remembrancer and many such all or most part of which foretold directly or covertly the ruin of the city nay some were so enthusiastically bold as to run about the streets with their oral predictions pretending they were sent to preach to the city and one in particular who like jonah to nineveh cried in the streets yet forty days and london shall be destroyed i will not be positive whether he said yet forty days or yet a few days another ran about naked except a pair of drawers about his waist crying day and night like a man that josephus mentions who cried woe to jerusalem a little before the destruction of that city so this poor naked creature cried oh the great and the dreadful god and said no more but repeated those words continually with a voice and countenance full of horror a swift pace and nobody could ever find him to stop or rest or take any sustenance at least that ever i could hear of i met this poor creature several times in the streets and would have spoken to him but he would not enter into speech with me or any one else but held on his dismal cries continually these things terrified the people to the last degree and especially when two or three times as i have mentioned already they found one or two in the bills dead of the plague at st giles's next to these public things were the dreams of old women or i should say the interpretation of old women upon other people's dreams and these put abundance of people even out of their wits some heard voices warning them to be gone for that there would be such a plague in london so that the living would not be able to bury the dead others saw apparitions in the air and i must be allowed to say of both i hope without breach of charity that they heard voices that never spake and saw sights that never appeared but the imagination of the people was really turned wayward and possessed and no wonder if they who were poring continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures representations and appearances which had nothing in them but air and vapour here they told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand coming out of a cloud with a point hanging directly over the city there they saw hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried and there again heaps of dead bodies lying unburied and the like just as the imagination of the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to work upon so hypochondriac fancies represent ships armies battles in the firmament till steady eyes the exhalations solve and all to its first matter cloud resolve i could fill this account with the strange relations such people gave every day of what they had seen and every one was so positive of their having seen what they pretended to see that there was no contradicting them without breach of friendship or being accounted rude and unmannerly on the one hand and profane and impenetrable on the other one time before the plague was begun otherwise than as i have said in st giles's i think it was in march seeing a crowd of people in the street i joined with them to satisfy my curiosity and found them all staring up into the air to see what a woman told them appeared plain to her which was an angel clothed in white with a fiery sword in his hand waving it or brandishing it over his head she described every part of the figure to the life showed them the motion and the form and the poor people came into it so eagerly and with so much readiness yes i see it all plainly says one there's the sword as plain as can be another saw the angel one saw his very face and cried out what a glorious creature he was one saw one thing and one another i looked as earnestly as the rest but perhaps not with so much willingness to be imposed upon and i said indeed that i could see nothing but a white cloud bright on one side by the shining of the sun upon the other part the woman endeavoured to show it me but could not make me confess that i saw it which indeed if i had i must have lied but the woman turning upon me looked in my face and fancied i laughed in which her imagination deceived her too for i really did not laugh but was very seriously reflecting how the poor people were terrified by the force of their own imagination however she turned from me called me profane fellow and a scoffer told me that it was a time of god's anger and dreadful judgements were approaching and that despisers such as i should wander and perish the people about her seemed disgusted as well as she and i found there was no persuading them that i did not laugh at them and that i should be rather mobbed by them than be able to undeceive them so i left them and this appearance passed for as real as the blazing star itself another encounter i had in the open day also and this was in going through a narrow passage from petty france into bishopsgate churchyard by a row of alms houses there are two churchyards to bishopsgate church or parish one we go over to pass from the place called petty france into bishopsgate street coming out just by the church door the other is on the side of the narrow passage where the alms houses are on the left and a dwarf wall with a palisado on it on the right hand and the city wall on the other side more to the right in this narrow passage stands a man looking through between the palisadoes into the burying place and as many people as the narrowness of the passage would admit to stop without hindering the passage of others and he was talking mightily eagerly to them and pointing now to one place then to another and affirming that he saw a ghost walking upon such a gravestone there he described the shape the posture and the movement of it so exactly that it was the greatest matter of amazement to him in the world that everybody did not see it as well as he on a sudden he would cry there it is now it comes this way then tis turned back till at length he persuaded the people into so firm a belief of it that one fancied he saw it and another fancied he saw it and thus he came every day making a strange hubbub considering it was in so narrow a passage till bishopsgate clock struck eleven and then the ghost would seem to start and as if he were called away disappeared on a sudden i looked earnestly every way and at the very moment that this man directed but could not see the least appearance of anything but so positive was this poor man that he gave the people the vapours in abundance and sent them away trembling and frighted till at length few people that knew of it cared to go through that passage and hardly anybody by night on any account whatever this ghost as the poor man affirmed made signs to the houses and to the ground and to the people plainly intimating or else they so understanding it that abundance of the people should come to be buried in that churchyard as indeed happened but that he saw such aspects i must acknowledge i never believed nor could i see anything of it myself though i looked most earnestly to see it if possible these things serve to show how far the people were really overcome with delusions and as they had a notion of the approach of a visitation all their predictions ran upon a most dreadful plague which should lay the whole city and even the kingdom waste and should destroy almost all the nation both man and beast to this as i said before the astrologers added stories of the conjunctions of planets in a malignant manner and with a mischievous influence one of which conjunctions was to happen and did happen in october and the other in november and they filled the people's heads with predictions on these signs of the heavens intimating that those conjunctions foretold drought famine and pestilence in the two first of them however they were entirely mistaken for we had no droughty season but in the beginning of the year a hard frost which lasted from december almost to march and after that moderate weather rather warm than hot with refreshing winds and in short very seasonable weather and also several very great rains some endeavours were used to suppress the printing of such books as terrified the people and to frighten the dispersers of them some of whom were taken up but nothing was done in it as i am informed the government being unwilling to exasperate the people who were as i may say all out of their wits already neither can i acquit those ministers that in their sermons rather sank than lifted up the hearts of their hearers many of them no doubt did it for the strengthening the resolution of the people and especially for quickening them to repentance but it certainly answered not their end at least not in proportion to the injury it did another way and indeed as god himself through the whole scriptures rather draws to him by invitations and calls to turn to him and live than drives us by terror and amazement so i must confess i thought the ministers should have done also imitating our blessed lord and master in this that his whole gospel is full of declarations from heaven of god's mercy and his readiness to receive penitents and forgive them complaining ye will not come unto me that ye may have life and that therefore his gospel is called the gospel of peace and the gospel of grace but we had some good men and that of all persuasions and opinions whose discourses were full of terror who spoke nothing but dismal things and as they brought the people together with a kind of horror sent them away in tears prophesying nothing but evil tidings terrifying the people with the apprehensions of being utterly destroyed not guiding them at least not enough to cry to heaven for mercy it was indeed a time of very unhappy breaches among us in matters of religion innumerable sects and divisions and separate opinions prevailed among the people the church of england was restored indeed with the restoration of the monarchy about four years before but the ministers and preachers of the presbyterians and independents and of all the other sorts of professions had begun to gather separate societies and erect altar against altar and all those had their meetings for worship apart as they have now but not so many then the dissenters being not thoroughly formed into a body as they are since and those congregations which were thus gathered together were yet but few and even those that were the government did not allow but endeavoured to suppress them and shut up their meetings but the visitation reconciled them again at least for a time and many of the best and most valuable ministers and preachers of the dissenters were suffered to go into the churches where the incumbents were fled away as many were not being able to stand it and the people flocked without distinction to hear them preach not much inquiring who or what opinion they were of but after the sickness was over that spirit of charity abated and every church being again supplied with their own ministers or others presented where the minister was dead things returned to their old channel again one mischief always introduces another these terrors and apprehensions of the people led them into a thousand weak foolish and wicked things which they wanted not a sort of people really wicked to encourage them to and this was running about to fortune tellers cunning men and astrologers to know their fortune or as it is vulgarly expressed to have their fortunes told them their nativities calculated and the like and this folly presently made the town swarm with a wicked generation of pretenders to magic to the black art as they called it and i know not what nay to a thousand worse dealings with the devil than they were really guilty of and this trade grew so open and so generally practised that it became common to have signs and inscriptions set up at doors here lives a fortune teller here lives an astrologer here you may have your nativity calculated and the like and friar bacon's brazen head which was the usual sign of these people's dwellings was to be seen almost in every street or else the sign of mother shipton or of merlin's head and the like with what blind absurd and ridiculous stuff these oracles of the devil pleased and satisfied the people i really know not but certain it is that innumerable attendants crowded about their doors every day and if but a grave fellow in a velvet jacket a band and a black coat which was the habit those quack conjurers generally went in was but seen in the streets the people would follow them in crowds and ask them questions as they went along i need not mention what a horrid delusion this was or what it tended to but there was no remedy for it till the plague itself put an end to it all and i suppose cleared the town of most of those calculators themselves one mischief was that if the poor people asked these mock astrologers whether there would be a"
