"1" "smoking room fell on to the floor if pascal had not heard this scene he would have deemed it incredible how could one suppose that a creditor would leave this princely mansion with his bill unpaid but more and more clearly he understood that there must be some greater cause of difference between husband and wife than this bill of twenty eight thousand francs for what was this amount to a confirmed gambler who without as much as a frown gained or lost a fortune every evening of his life evidently there was some skeleton in this household one of those terrible secrets which make a man and his wife enemies and all the more bitter enemies as they are bound together by a chain which it is impossible to break and undoubtedly a good many of the insults which the baron had heaped upon van klopen must have been intended for the baroness these thoughts darted through pascal's mind with the rapidity of lightning and showed him the horrible position in which he was placed the baron who had been so favorably disposed toward him and from whom he was expecting a great service would undoubtedly hate him undoubtedly become his enemy when he learned that he had been a listener although an involuntary one to this conversation with van klopen how did it happen that he had been placed in this dangerous position what had become of the footman who had taken his card these were questions which he was unable to answer and what was he to do if he could have retired noiselessly if he could have reached the courtyard and have made his escape without being observed he would not have hesitated but was this plan practicable and would not his card betray him would it not be discovered sooner or later that he had been in the smoking room while m van klopen was in the dining room in any case delicacy of feeling as well as his own interest forbade him to remain any longer a listener to the private conversation of the baron and his wife he therefore noisily moved a chair and coughed in that affected style which means in every country take care i'm here but he did not succeed in attracting attention and yet the silence was profound he could distinctly hear the creaking of the baron's boots as he paced to and fro and the sound of fingers nervously beating a tattoo on the table if he desired to avoid hearing the confidential conversation which would no doubt ensue between the baron and his wife there was but one course for him to pursue and that was to reveal his presence at once he was about to do so when some one opened a door which must have led from the hall into the dining room he listened attentively but only heard a few confused words to which the baron replied very well that's sufficient i will see him in a moment pascal breathed freely once more they have just given him my card he thought i can remain now he will come here in a moment the baron must really have started to leave the room for his wife exclaimed one word more have you quite decided oh fully you are resolved to leave me exposed to the persecutions of my dressmaker van klopen is too charming and polite to cause you the least worry you will brave the disgrace of a law suit nonsense you know very well that he won't bring any action against me unfortunately and besides pray tell me where the disgrace would be i have a foolish wife is that my fault i oppose her absurd extravagance haven't i a right to do so if all husbands were as courageous we should soon close the establishments of these artful men who minister to your vanity and use you ladies as puppets or living advertisements to display the absurd fashions which enrich them the baron took two or three more steps forward as if about to leave the room but his wife interposed the baroness trigault whose husband has an income of seven or eight hundred thousand francs a year can't go about clad like a simple woman of the middle classes i should see nothing so very improper in that oh i know only your ideas don't coincide with mine i shall never consent to make myself ridiculous among the ladies of my set among my friends it would indeed be a pity to arouse the disapproval of your friends this sneering remark certainly irritated the baroness for it was with the greatest vehemence that she replied all my friends are ladies of the highest rank in society noble ladies the baron no doubt shrugged his shoulders for in a tone of crushing irony and scorn he exclaimed noble ladies whom do you call noble ladies pray the brainless fools who only think of displaying themselves and making themselves notorious the senseless idiots who pique themselves on surpassing lewd women in audacity extravagance and effrontery who fleece their husbands as cleverly as courtesans fleece their lovers noble ladies who drink and smoke and carouse who attend masked balls and talk slang noble ladies the idiots who long for the applause of the crowd and consider notoriety to be desirable and flattering a woman is only noble by her virtues and the chief of all virtues modesty is entirely wanting in your illustrious friends monsieur interrupted the baroness in a voice husky with anger you forget yourself you but the baron was well under way if it is scandal that crowns one a great lady you are one and one of the greatest for you are notorious almost as notorious as jenny fancy can't i learn from the newspapers all your sayings and gestures your amusements your occupations and the toilettes you wear it is impossible to read of a first performance at a theatre or of a horse race without finding your name coupled with that of jenny fancy or cora pearl or ninette simplon i should be a very strange husband indeed if i wasn't proud and delighted ah you are a treasure to the reporters on the day before yesterday the baroness trigault skated in the bois yesterday she was driving in her pony carriage to day she distinguished herself by her skill at pigeon shooting to morrow she will display herself half nude in some tableaux vivants on the day after to morrow she will inaugurate a new style of hair dressing and take part in a comedy it is always the baroness trigault who is the observed of all observers at vincennes the baroness trigault has lost five hundred louis in betting the baroness trigault uses her lorgnette with charming impertinence it is she who has declared it proper form to take a drop on returning from the bois no one is so famed for form as the baroness and silk merchants have bestowed her name upon a color people rave of the trigault blue what glory there are also costumes trigault for the witty elegant baroness has a host of admirers who follow her everywhere and loudly sing her praises this is what i a plain honest man read every day in the newspapers the whole world not only knows how my wife dresses but how she looks en dishabille and how she is formed folks are aware that she has an exquisite foot a divinely shaped leg and a perfect hand no one is ignorant of the fact that my wife's shoulders are of dazzling whiteness and that high on the left shoulder there is a most enticing little mole i had the satisfaction of reading this particular last evening it is charming upon my word and i am truly a fortunate man in the smoking room pascal could hear the baroness angrily stamp her foot as she exclaimed it is an outrageous insult your journalists are most impertinent why do they ever trouble honest women they wouldn't trouble me if i had a husband who knew how to make them treat me with respect the baron laughed a strident nervous laugh which it was not pleasant to hear and which revealed the fact that intense suffering was hidden beneath all this banter would you like me to fight a duel then after twenty years has the idea of ridding yourself of me occurred to you again i can scarcely believe it you know too well that you would receive none of my money that i have guarded against that besides you would be inconsolable if the newspapers ceased talking about you for a single day respect yourself and you will be respected the publicity you complain of is the last anchor which prevents society from drifting one knows not where those who would not listen to the warning voice of honor and conscience are restrained by the fear of a little paragraph which might disclose their shame now that a woman no longer has a conscience the newspapers act in place of it and i think it quite right for it is our only hope of salvation by the stir in the adjoining room pascal felt sure that the baroness had stationed herself before the door to prevent her husband from leaving her ah well monsieur she exclaimed i declare to you that i must have van klopen's twenty eight thousand francs before this evening i will have them too i am resolved to have them and you will give them to me oh thundered the baron you will have them you will he paused and then after a moment's reflection he said very well so be it i will give you this amount but not just now still if as you say it is absolutely necessary that you should have it to day there is a means of procuring it pawn your diamonds for thirty thousand francs i authorize you to do so and i give you my word of honor that i will redeem them within a week say will you do this and as the baroness made no reply he continued you don't answer shall i tell you why it is because your diamonds were long since sold and replaced by imitation ones it is because you are head over heels in debt it is because you have stooped so low as to borrow your maid's savings it is because you already owe three thousand francs to one of my coachmen it is because our steward lends you money at the rate of thirty or forty per cent it is false the baron sneered you certainly must think me a much greater fool than i really am he replied i'm not often at home it's true the sight of you exasperates me but i know what's going on you believe me your dupe but you are altogether mistaken it is not twenty seven thousand francs you owe van klopen but fifty or sixty thousand however he is careful not to demand payment if he brought me a bill this morning it was only because you had begged him to do so and because it had been agreed he should give you the money back if i paid him in short if you require twenty eight thousand francs before to night it is because m fernand de coralth has demanded that sum and because you have promised to give it to him leaning against the wall of the smoking room speechless and motionless holding his breath with his hands pressed upon his heart as if to stop its throbbings pascal ferailleur listened he no longer thought of flying he no longer thought of reproaching himself for his enforced indiscretion he had lost all consciousness of his position the name of the viscount de coralth thus mentioned in the course of this frightful scene came as a revelation to him he now understood the meaning of the baron's conduct his visit to the rue d'ulm and his promises of help were all explained my mother was right he thought the baron hates that miserable viscount mortally he will do all in his power to assist me meanwhile the baroness energetically denied her husband's charges she swore that she did not know what he meant what had m de coralth to do with all this she commanded her husband to speak more plainly to explain his odious insinuations he allowed her to speak for a moment and then suddenly in a harsh sarcastic voice he interrupted her by saying oh enough no more hypocrisy why do you try to defend yourself what matters one crime more i know only too well that what i say is true and if you desire proofs they shall be in your hands in less than half an hour it is a long time since i was blind full twenty years nothing concerning you has escaped my knowledge and observation since the cursed day when i discovered the depths of your disgrace and infamy since the terrible evening when i heard you plan to murder me in cold blood you had grown accustomed to freedom of action while i who had gone off with the first gold seekers was braving a thousand dangers in california so as to win wealth and luxury for you more quickly fool that i was no task seemed too hard or too distasteful when i thought of you and i was always thinking of you my mind was at peace i had perfect faith in you we had a daughter and if a fear or a doubt entered my mind i told myself that the sight of her cradle would drive all evil thoughts from your heart the adultery of a childless wife may be forgiven or explained but that of a mother never fool idiot that i was with what joyous pride on my return after an absence of eighteen months i showed you the treasures i had brought back with me i had two hundred thousand francs i said to you as i embraced you it is yours my well beloved the source of all my happiness but you did not care for me i wearied you you loved another and while you were deceiving me with your caresses you were with fiendish skill preparing a conspiracy which if it had succeeded would have resulted in my death i should consider myself amply revenged if i could make you suffer for a single day all the torments that i endured for long months for this was not all you had not even the excuse if excuse it be of a powerful all absorbing passion convinced of your treachery i resolved to ascertain everything and i discovered that in my absence you had become a mother why didn't i kill you how did i have the courage to remain silent and conceal what i knew ah it was because by watching you i hoped to discover the cursed bastard and your accomplice it was because i dreamed of a vengeance as terrible as the offence i said to myself that the day would come when at any risk you would try to see your child again to embrace her and provide for her future fool fool that i was you had already forgotten her when you received news of my intended return she was sent to some foundling asylum or left to die upon some door step have you ever thought of her have you ever asked what has become of her ever asked yourself if she had needed bread while you have been living in almost regal luxury ever asked yourself into what depths of vice she may have fallen always the same ridiculous accusation exclaimed the baroness yes always you must know however that this story of a child is only a vile slander i told you so when you spoke of it to me a dozen years afterward i have repeated it a thousand times since the baron uttered a sigh that was very like a sob and without paying any heed to his wife's words he continued if i consented to allow you to remain under my roof it was only for the sake of our daughter i trembled lest the scandal of a separation should fall upon her but it was useless suffering on my part she was as surely lost as you yourself were and it was your work too what you blame me for that whom ought i to blame then who took her to balls and theatres and races to every place where a young girl ought not to be taken who initiated her into what you call high life and who used her as a discreet and easy chaperon who married her to a wretch who is a disgrace to the title he bears and who has completed the work of demoralization you began and what is your daughter to day her extravagance has made her notorious even among the shameless women who pretend to be leaders of society she is scarcely twenty two and there is not a single prejudice left for her to brave her husband is the companion of actresses and courtesans her own companions are no better and in less than two years the million of francs which i bestowed on her as a dowry has been squandered recklessly squandered for there isn't a penny of it left and at this very hour my daughter and my son in law are plotting to extort money from me on the day before yesterday listen carefully to this my son in law came to ask me for a hundred thousand francs and when i refused them he threatened if i did not give them to him that he would publish some letters written by my daughter by his wife to some low scoundrel i was horrified and gave him what he asked but that same evening i learned that the husband and wife my daughter and my son in law had concocted this vile conspiracy together yes i have positive proofs of it leaving here and not wishing to return home that day he telegraphed the good news to his wife but in his delight he made a mistake in the address and the telegram was brought here i opened it and read papa has fallen into the trap my darling i beat my drum and he surrendered at once yes that is what he dared to write and sign with his own name and then send to his wife my daughter pascal was absolutely terrified he wondered if he were not the victim of some absurd nightmare if his senses were not playing him false he had little conception of the terrible dramas which are constantly enacted in these superb mansions so admired and envied by the passing crowd he thought that the baroness would be crushed that she would fall on her knees before her husband what a mistake the tone of her voice told him that instead of yielding she was only bent on retaliation does your son in law do anything worse than you she exclaimed how dare you censure him you who drag your name through all the gambling dens of europe wretch interrupted the baron wretch but quickly mastering himself he remarked yes it's true that i gamble people say that great baron trigault is never without cards in his hands but you know very well that i really hold gambling in horror that i loathe it but when i play i sometimes forget for i must forget i tried drink but it wouldn't drown thought so i had recourse to cards and when the stakes are large and my fortune is imperilled i sometimes lose consciousness of my misery the baroness gave vent to a cold sneering laugh and in a tone of mocking commiseration she said poor baron it is no doubt in the hope of forgetting your sorrows that you spend all your time when you are not gambling with a woman named lia d'argeles she's rather pretty i have seen her several times in the bois be silent exclaimed the baron be silent don't insult an unfortunate woman who is a thousand times better than yourself and feeling that he could endure no more that he could no longer restrain his passion he cried out of my sight go or i sha'n't be responsible for my acts pascal heard a chair move the floor creak and a moment afterward a lady passed quickly through the smoking room how was it that she did not perceive him no doubt because she was greatly agitated in spite of her bravado and besides he was standing a little back in the shade but he saw her and his brain reeled good lord what a likeness he murmured iii it was as if he had seen an apparition and he was vainly striving to drive away a terrible mysterious fear when a heavy footfall made the floor of the dining room creak anew the noise restored him to consciousness of his position it is the baron he thought he is coming this way if he finds me here i am lost he will never consent to help me a man would never forgive another man for hearing what i have just heard why should he not try to make his escape the card bearing the name of maumejan would be no proof of his visit he could see the baron somewhere else some other day elsewhere than at his own house so that he need not fear the recognition of the servants these thoughts flashed through his mind and he was about to fly when a harsh cry held him spell bound baron trigault was standing on the threshold his emotion as is almost always the case with corpulent people was evinced by a frightful distortion of his features his face was transformed his lips had become perfectly white and his eyes seemed to be starting from their sockets how came you here he asked in a husky voice your servants ushered me into this room who are you what monsieur don't you recognize me rejoined pascal who in his agitation forgot that the baron had seen him only twice before he forgot the absence of his beard his almost ragged clothing and all the precautions he had taken to render recognition impossible i have never met any person named maumejan said the baron ah monsieur that's not my name have you forgotten the innocent man who was caught in that infamous snare set for him by the viscount de coralth yes yes replied the baron i remember you now and then recollecting the terrible scene that had just taken place in the adjoining room how long have you been here he asked should pascal tell a falsehood or confess the truth he hesitated but his hesitation lasted scarcely the tenth part of a second i have been here about half an hour he replied the baron's livid cheeks suddenly became purple his eyes glittered and it seemed by his threatening gesture as if he were strongly tempted to murder this man who had discovered the terrible disgraceful secrets of his domestic life but it was a mere flash of energy the terrible ordeal which he had just passed through had exhausted him mentally and physically and it was in a faltering voice that he resumed then you have not lost a word a word of what was said in the other room not a word the baron sank on to the divan so the knowledge of my disgrace is no longer confined to myself he exclaimed a stranger's eye has penetrated the depths of misery i have fallen into the secret of my wretchedness and shame is mine no longer oh monsieur monsieur interrupted pascal before i recross the threshold of your home all shall have been forgotten i swear it by all that is most sacred he had raised his hand as if to take a solemn oath when the baron caught hold of it and pressing it with sorrowful gratitude exclaimed i believe you you are a man of honor i only needed to see your home to be convinced of that you will not laugh at my misfortunes or my misery he must have been suffering frightfully for big tears rolled slowly down his cheeks what have i done my god that i should be so cruelly punished he continued i have always been generous and charitable and ready to help all who applied to me i am utterly alone i have a wife and a daughter but they hate me they long for my death which would give them possession of my wealth what torture for months together i dared not eat a morsel of food either in my own house or in the house of my son in law i feared poison and i never partook of a dish until i had seen my daughter or my wife do so to prevent a crime i was obliged to resort to the strangest expedients i made a will and left my property in such a way that if i die my family will not receive one penny so they now have an interest in prolonging my life as he spoke he sprang up with an almost frenzied air and seizing pascal by the arm again continued nor is this all this woman my wife you know you have heard the extent of her shame and degradation ah well i love her pascal recoiled with an exclamation of mingled horror and consternation this amazes you eh rejoined the baron it is indeed incomprehensible monstrous but it is the truth it is to gratify her desire for luxury that i have toiled to amass millions if i purchased a title which is absurd and ridiculous it was only because i wished to satisfy her vanity do what she may i can only see in her the chaste and beautiful wife of our early married life it is cowardly absurd ridiculous i realize it but my love is stronger than my reason or my will i love her madly passionately i cannot tear her from my heart so speaking he sank sobbing on to the divan again was this indeed the frivolous and jovial baron trigault whom pascal had seen at madame d'argeles's house the man of self satisfied mien and superb assurance the good natured cynic the frequenter of gambling dens alas yes but the baron whom the world knew was only a comedian this was the real man after a little while he succeeded in controlling his emotion and in a comparatively calm voice he exclaimed but it is useless to distract one's mind with an incurable evil let us speak of yourself m ferailleur to what do i owe the honor of this visit to your own kind offer monsieur and the hope that you will help me in refuting this slander and wreaking vengeance upon those who have ruined me oh yes i will help you in that to the full extent of my power exclaimed the baron but experience reminded him that confidential disclosures ought not to be made with the doors open so he rose shut them and returning to pascal said explain in what way i can be of service to you monsieur it was not without many misgivings that pascal had presented himself at the baron's house but after what he had heard he felt no further hesitation he could speak with perfect freedom it is quite unnecessary for me to tell you monsieur le baron he began that the cards which made me win were inserted in the pack by m de coralth that is proven beyond question and whatever the consequences may be i shall have my revenge but before striking him i wish to reach the man whose instrument he was what you suppose i don't suppose i am sure that m de coralth acted in obedience to the instructions of some other scoundrel whose courage does not equal his meanness perhaps so i think he would shrink from nothing in the way of rascality but who could have employed him in this vile work of dishonoring an honest man the marquis de valorsay on hearing this name the baron bounded to his feet impossible he exclaimed absolutely impossible m de valorsay is incapable of the villainy you ascribe to him what do i say he is even above suspicion i have known him for years and i have never met a more loyal more honorable or more courageous man he is one of my few trusted friends we see each other almost every day i am expecting a visit from him even now still it was he who incited m de coralth to do the deed but why what could have been his object to win a young girl whom i love she loved me and he saw that i was an obstacle he put me out of the way more surely than if he had murdered me if i died she might mourn for me dishonored she would spurn me is valorsay so madly in love with the girl then i think he cares but very little for her then why she is the heiress of several millions it was evident that this explanation did not shake baron trigault's faith in his friend but the marquis has an income of a hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand francs said he that is an all sufficient justification with his fortune and his name he is in a position to choose his wife from"
