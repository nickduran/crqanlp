"1" "by paying the expenses of difficult experiments the experiments it must be added were often of his own making and he must have the honor of whatever brilliancy attaches in the estimation of the world to such pursuits it was not indeed a brilliancy that dazzled bernard longueville who however was not easily dazzled by anything it was because he regarded him in so plain and direct a fashion that bernard had an affection for his friend an affection to which it would perhaps be difficult to assign a definite cause personal sympathies are doubtless caused by something but the causes are remote mysterious to our daily vision like those of the particular state of the weather we content ourselves with remarking that it is fine or that it rains and the enjoyment of our likes and dislikes is by no means apt to borrow its edge from the keenness of our analysis longueville had a relish for fine quality superior savour and he was sensible of this merit in the simple candid manly affectionate nature of his comrade which seemed to him an excellent thing of its kind gordon wright had a tender heart and a strong will a combination which when the understanding is not too limited is often the motive of admirable actions there might sometimes be a question whether gordon's understanding were sufficiently unlimited but the impulses of a generous temper often play a useful part in filling up the gaps of an incomplete imagination and the general impression that wright produced was certainly that of intelligent good nature the reasons for appreciating bernard longueville were much more manifest he pleased superficially as well as fundamentally nature had sent him into the world with an armful of good gifts he was very good looking tall dark agile perfectly finished so good looking that he might have been a fool and yet be forgiven as has already been intimated however he was far from being a fool he had a number of talents which during three or four years that followed his leaving college had received the discipline of the study of the law he had not made much of the law but he had made something of his talents he was almost always spoken of as accomplished people asked why he did n't do something this question was never satisfactorily answered the feeling being that longueville did more than many people in causing it to be asked moreover there was one thing he did constantly he enjoyed himself this is manifestly not a career and it has been said at the outset that he was not attached to any of the recognized professions but without going into details he was a charming fellow clever urbane free handed and with that fortunate quality in his appearance which is known as distinction chapter iii he had not specified in writing to gordon wright the day on which he should arrive at baden baden it must be confessed that he was not addicted to specifying days he came to his journey's end in the evening and on presenting himself at the hotel from which his friend had dated his letter he learned that gordon wright had betaken himself after dinner according to the custom of baden baden to the grounds of the conversation house it was eight o'clock and longueville after removing the stains of travel sat down to dine his first impulse had been to send for gordon to come and keep him company at his repast but on second thought he determined to make it as brief as possible having brought it to a close he took his way to the kursaal the great german watering place is one of the prettiest nooks in europe and of a summer evening in the gaming days five and twenty years ago it was one of the most brilliant scenes the lighted windows of the great temple of hazard of as chaste an architecture as if it had been devoted to a much purer divinity opened wide upon the gardens and groves the little river that issues from the bosky mountains of the black forest flowed with an air of brook like innocence past the expensive hotels and lodging houses the orchestra in a high pavilion on the terrace of the kursaal played a discreet accompaniment to the conversation of the ladies and gentlemen who scattered over the large expanse on a thousand little chairs preferred for the time the beauties of nature to the shuffle of coin and the calculation of chance while the faint summer stars twinkling above the vague black hills and woods looked down at the indifferent groups without venturing to drop their light upon them longueville noting all this went straight into the gaming rooms he was curious to see whether his friend being fond of experiments was trying combinations at roulette but he was not to be found in any of the gilded chambers among the crowd that pressed in silence about the tables so that bernard presently came and began to wander about the lamp lit terrace where innumerable groups seated and strolling made the place a gigantic conversazione it seemed to him very agreeable and amusing and he remarked to himself that for a man who was supposed not to take especially the epicurean view of life gordon wright in coming to baden had certainly made himself comfortable longueville went his way glancing from one cluster of talkers to another and at last he saw a face which brought him to a stop he stood a moment looking at it he knew he had seen it before he had an excellent memory for faces but it was some time before he was able to attach an identity to this one where had he seen a little elderly lady with an expression of timorous vigilance and a band of hair as softly white as a dove's wing the answer to the question presently came where but in a grass grown corner of an old italian town the lady was the mother of his inconsequent model so that this mysterious personage was probably herself not far off before longueville had time to verify this induction he found his eyes resting upon the broad back of a gentleman seated close to the old lady and who turning away from her was talking to a young girl it was nothing but the back of this gentleman that he saw but nevertheless with the instinct of true friendship he recognized in this featureless expanse the robust personality of gordon wright in a moment he had stepped forward and laid his hand upon wright's shoulder his friend looked round and then sprang up with a joyous exclamation and grasp of the hand my dear fellow my dear bernard what on earth when did you arrive while bernard answered and explained a little he glanced from his friend's good gratified face at the young girl with whom wright had been talking and then at the lady on the other side who was giving him a bright little stare he raised his hat to her and to the young girl and he became conscious as regards the latter of a certain disappointment she was very pretty she was looking at him but she was not the heroine of the little incident of the terrace at siena it s just like longueville you know gordon wright went on he always comes at you from behind he s so awfully fond of surprises he was laughing he was greatly pleased he introduced bernard to the two ladies you must know mrs vivian you must know miss blanche evers bernard took his place in the little circle he wondered whether he ought to venture upon a special recognition of mrs vivian then it seemed to him that he should leave the option of this step with the lady especially as he had detected recognition in her eye but mrs vivian ventured upon nothing special she contented herself with soft generalities with remarking that she always liked to know when people would arrive that for herself she never enjoyed surprises and yet i imagine you have had your share said longueville with a smile he thought this might remind her of the moment when she came out of the little church at siena and found her daughter posturing to an unknown painter but mrs vivian turning her benignant head about gave but a superficial reply oh i have had my share of everything good and bad i don't complain of anything and she gave a little deprecating laugh gordon wright shook hands with bernard again he seemed really very glad to see him longueville remembering that gordon had written to him that he had been making love began to seek in his countenance for the ravages of passion for the moment however they were not apparent the excellent honest fellow looked placid and contented gordon wright had a clear gray eye short straight flaxen hair and a healthy diffusion of color his features were thick and rather irregular but his countenance in addition to the merit of its expression derived a certain grace from a powerful yellow moustache to which its wearer occasionally gave a martial twist gordon wright was not tall but he was strong and in his whole person there was something well planted and sturdy he almost always dressed in light colored garments and he wore round his neck an eternal blue cravat when he was agitated he grew very red while he questioned longueville about his journey and his health his whereabouts and his intentions the latter among his own replies endeavored to read in wright's eyes some account of his present situation was that pretty girl at his side the ambiguous object of his adoration and in that case what was the function of the elder lady and what had become of her argumentative daughter perhaps this was another a younger daughter though indeed she bore no resemblance to either of longueville's friends gordon wright in spite of bernard's interrogative glances indulged in no optical confidences he had too much to tell he would keep his story till they should be alone together it was impossible that they should adjourn just yet to social solitude the two ladies were under gordon's protection mrs vivian bernard felt a satisfaction in learning her name it was as if a curtain half pulled up and stopped by a hitch had suddenly been raised altogether mrs vivian sat looking up and down the terrace at the crowd of loungers and talkers with an air of tender expectation she was probably looking for her elder daughter and longueville could not help wishing also that this young lady would arrive meanwhile he saw that the young girl to whom gordon had been devoting himself was extremely pretty and appeared eminently approachable longueville had some talk with her reflecting that if she were the person concerning whom gordon had written him it behooved him to appear to take an interest in her this view of the case was confirmed by gordon wright's presently turning away to talk with mrs vivian so that his friend might be at liberty to make acquaintance with their companion though she had not been with the others at siena it seemed to longueville with regard to her too that this was not the first time he had seen her she was simply the american pretty girl whom he had seen a thousand times it was a numerous sisterhood pervaded by a strong family likeness this young lady had charming eyes of the color of gordon's cravats which looked everywhere at once and yet found time to linger in some places where longueville's own eyes frequently met them she had soft brown hair with a silky golden thread in it beautifully arranged and crowned by a smart little hat that savoured of paris she had also a slender little figure neatly rounded and delicate narrow hands prettily gloved she moved about a great deal in her place twisted her little flexible body and tossed her head fingered her hair and examined the ornaments of her dress she had a great deal of conversation longueville speedily learned and she expressed herself with extreme frankness and decision he asked her to begin with if she had been long at baden but the impetus of this question was all she required turning her charming conscious coquettish little face upon him she instantly began to chatter i have been here about four weeks i don't know whether you call that long it does n't seem long to me i have had such a lovely time i have met ever so many people here i know every day some one turns up now you have turned up to day ah but you don't know me said longueville laughing well i have heard a great deal about you cried the young girl with a pretty little stare of contradiction i think you know a great friend of mine miss ella maclane of baltimore she s travelling in europe now longueville's memory did not instantly respond to this signal but he expressed that rapturous assent which the occasion demanded and even risked the observation that the young lady from baltimore was very pretty she s far too lovely his companion went on i have often heard her speak of you i think you know her sister rather better than you know her she has not been out very long she is just as interesting as she can be her hair comes down to her feet she s travelling in norway she has been everywhere you can think of and she s going to finish off with finland you can't go any further than that can you that s one comfort she will have to turn round and come back i want her dreadfully to come to baden baden i wish she would said longueville is she travelling alone oh no they ve got some englishman they say he s devoted to ella every one seems to have an englishman now we ve got one here captain lovelock the honourable augustus lovelock well they re awfully handsome ella maclane is dying to come to baden baden i wish you d write to her her father and mother have got some idea in their heads they think it s improper what do you call it immoral i wish you would write to her and tell her it is n't i wonder if they think that mrs vivian would come to a place that s immoral mrs vivian says she would take her in a moment she does n't seem to care how many she has i declare she s only too kind you know i m in mrs vivian's care my mother s gone to marienbad she would let me go with mrs vivian anywhere on account of the influence she thinks so much of mrs vivian's influence i have always heard a great deal about it have n't you i must say it s lovely it s had a wonderful effect upon me i don't want to praise myself but it has you ask mrs vivian if i have n't been good i have been just as good as i can be i have been so peaceful i have just sat here this way do you call this immoral you re not obliged to gamble if you don't want to ella maclane's father seems to think you get drawn in i m sure i have n't been drawn in i know what you re going to say you re going to say i have been drawn out well i have to night we just sit here so quietly there s nothing to do but to talk we make a little party by ourselves are you going to belong to our party two of us are missing miss vivian and captain lovelock captain lovelock has gone with her into the rooms to explain the gambling miss vivian always wants everything explained i am sure i understood it the first time i looked at the tables have you ever seen miss vivian she s very much admired she s so very unusual black hair s so uncommon i see you have got it too but i mean for young ladies i am sure one sees everything here there s a woman that comes to the tables a portuguese countess who has hair that is positively blue i can't say i admire it when it comes to that shade blue s my favorite color but i prefer it in the eyes continued longueville's companion resting upon him her own two brilliant little specimens of the tint he listened with that expression of clear amusement which is not always an indication of high esteem but which even pretty chatterers who are not the reverse of estimable often prefer to masculine inattention and while he listened bernard according to his wont made his reflections he said to himself that there were two kinds of pretty girls the acutely conscious and the finely unconscious mrs vivian's protege was a member of the former category she belonged to the genus coquette we all have our conception of the indispensable and the indispensable to this young lady was a spectator almost any male biped would serve the purpose to her spectator she addressed for the moment the whole volume of her being addressed it in her glances her attitudes her exclamations in a hundred little experiments of tone and gesture and position and these rustling artifices were so innocent and obvious that the directness of her desire to be well with her observer became in itself a grace it led bernard afterward to say to himself that the natural vocation and metier of little girls for whom existence was but a shimmering surface was to prattle and ruffle their plumage their view of life and its duties was as simple and superficial as that of an oriental bayadere it surely could not be with regard to this transparent little flirt that gordon wright desired advice you could literally see the daylight or rather the baden gaslight on the other side of her she sat there for a minute turning her little empty head to and fro and catching bernard's eye every time she moved she had for the instant the air of having exhausted all topics just then a young lady with a gentleman at her side drew near to the little group and longueville perceiving her instantly got up from his chair there s a beauty of the unconscious class he said to himself he knew her face very well he had spent half an hour in copying it here comes miss vivian said gordon wright also getting up as if to make room for the daughter near the mother she stopped in front of them smiling slightly and then she rested her eyes upon longueville their gaze at first was full and direct but it expressed nothing more than civil curiosity this was immediately followed however by the light of recognition recognition embarrassed and signalling itself by a blush miss vivian's companion was a powerful handsome fellow with a remarkable auburn beard who struck the observer immediately as being uncommonly well dressed he carried his hands in the pockets of a little jacket the button hole of which was adorned with a blooming rose he approached blanche evers smiling and dandling his body a little and making her two or three jocular bows well i hope you have lost every penny you put on the table said the young girl by way of response to his obeisances he began to laugh and repeat them i don't care what i lose so long so long so long as what pray so long as you let me sit down by you and he dropped very gallantly into a chair on the other side of her i wish you would lose all your property she replied glancing at bernard it would be a very small stake said captain lovelock would you really like to see me reduced to misery while this graceful dialogue rapidly established itself miss vivian removed her eyes from longueville's face and turned toward her mother but gordon wright checked this movement by laying his hand on longueville's shoulder and proceeding to introduce his friend this is the accomplished creature mr bernard longueville of whom you have heard me speak one of his accomplishments as you see is to drop down from the moon no i don't drop from the moon said bernard laughing i drop from siena he offered his hand to miss vivian who for an appreciable instant hesitated to extend her own then she returned his salutation without any response to his allusion to siena she declined to take a seat and said she was tired and preferred to go home with this suggestion her mother immediately complied and the two ladies appealed to the indulgence of little miss evers who was obliged to renounce the society of captain lovelock she enjoyed this luxury however on the way to mrs vivian's lodgings toward which they all slowly strolled in the sociable baden fashion longueville might naturally have found himself next miss vivian but he received an impression that she avoided him she walked in front and gordon wright strolled beside her though longueville noticed that they appeared to exchange but few words he himself offered his arm to mrs vivian who paced along with a little lightly wavering step making observations upon the beauties of baden and the respective merits of the hotels chapter iv which of them is it asked longueville of his friend after they had bidden good night to the three ladies and to captain lovelock who went off to begin as he said the evening they stood when they had turned away from the door of mrs vivian's lodgings in the little rough paved german street which of them is what gordon asked staring at his companion oh come said longueville you are not going to begin to play at modesty at this hour did n't you write to me that you had been making violent love violent no the more shame to you has your love making been feeble his friend looked at him a moment rather soberly i suppose you thought it a queer document that letter i wrote you i thought it characteristic said longueville smiling is n't that the same thing not in the least i have never thought you a man of oddities gordon stood there looking at him with a serious eye half appealing half questioning but at these last words he glanced away even a very modest man may wince a little at hearing himself denied the distinction of a few variations from the common type longueville made this reflection and it struck him also that his companion was in a graver mood than he had expected though why after all should he have been in a state of exhilaration your letter was a very natural interesting one bernard added well you see said gordon facing his companion again i have been a good deal preoccupied obviously my dear fellow i want very much to marry it s a capital idea said longueville i think almost as well of it his friend declared as if i had invented it it has struck me for the first time these words were uttered with a mild simplicity which provoked longueville to violent laughter my dear fellow he exclaimed you have after all your little oddities singularly enough however gordon wright failed to appear flattered by this concession i did n't send for you to laugh at me he said ah but i have n't travelled three hundred miles to cry seriously solemnly then it is one of these young ladies that has put marriage into your head not at all i had it in my head having a desire to marry you proceeded to fall in love i am not in love said gordon wright with some energy ah then my dear fellow why did you send for me wright looked at him an instant in silence because i thought you were a good fellow as well as a clever one a good fellow repeated longueville i don't understand your confounded scientific nomenclature but excuse me i won't laugh i am not a clever fellow but i am a good one he paused a moment and then laid his hand on his companion's shoulder my dear gordon it s no use you are in love well i don't want to be said wright heavens what a horrible sentiment i want to marry with my eyes open i want to know my wife you don't know people when you are in love with them your impressions are colored they are supposed to be slightly and you object to color well as i say i want to know the woman i marry as i should know any one else i want to see her as clearly depend upon it you have too great an appetite for knowledge you set too high an esteem upon the dry light of science ah said gordon promptly of course i want to be fond of her bernard in spite of his protest began to laugh again my dear gordon you are better than your theories your passionate heart contradicts your frigid intellect i repeat it you are in love please don't repeat it again said wright bernard took his arm and they walked along what shall i call it then you are engaged in making studies for matrimony i don't in the least object to your calling it that my studies are of extreme interest and one of those young ladies is the fair volume that contains the precious lesson said longueville or perhaps your text book is in two volumes no there is one of them i am not studying at all i never could do two things at once that proves you are in love one can't be in love with two women at once but one may perfectly have two of them or as many as you please up for a competitive examination however as i asked you before which of these young ladies is it that you have selected gordon wright stopped abruptly eying his friend which should you say ah that s not a fair question bernard urged it would be invidious for me to name one rather than the other and if i were to mention the wrong one i should feel as if i had been guilty of a rudeness towards the other don't you see gordon saw perhaps but he held to his idea of making his companion commit himself never mind the rudeness i will do the same by you some day to make it up which of them should you think me likely to have taken a fancy to on general grounds now from what you know of me he proposed this problem with an animated eye you forget his friend said that though i know thank heaven a good deal of you i know very little of either of those girls i have had too little evidence yes but you are a man who notices that s why i wanted you to come i spoke only to miss evers yes i know you have never spoken to miss vivian gordon wright stood looking at bernard and urging his point as he pronounced these words bernard felt peculiarly conscious of his gaze the words represented an illusion and longueville asked himself quickly whether it were not his duty to dispel it the answer came more slowly than the question but still it came in the shape of a negative the illusion was but a trifling one and it was not for him after all to let his friend know that he had already met miss vivian it was for the young girl herself and since she had not done so although she had the opportunity longueville said to himself that he was bound in honor not to speak these reflections were very soon made but in the midst of them our young man thanks to a great agility of mind found time to observe tacitly that it was odd just there to see his honor thrusting in its nose miss vivian in her own good time would doubtless mention to gordon the little incident of siena it was bernard's fancy for a moment that he already knew it and that the remark he had just uttered had an ironical accent but this impression was completely dissipated by the tone in which he added all the same you noticed her oh yes she is very noticeable well then said gordon you will see i should like you to make it out of course if i am really giving my attention to one to the exclusion of the other it will be easy to discover longueville was half amused half irritated by his friend's own relish of his little puzzle the exclusion of the other has an awkward sound he answered as they walked on am i to notice that you are very rude to one of the young ladies oh dear no do you think there is a danger of that well said longueville i have already guessed gordon wright remonstrated don't guess yet wait a few days i won't tell you now let us see if he does n't tell me said bernard privately and he meditated a moment when i presented myself you were sitting very close to miss evers and talking very earnestly your head was bent toward her"
