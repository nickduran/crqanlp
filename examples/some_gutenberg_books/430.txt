"1" "they wished to band together to do a thing expressly forbidden by the law they wished to conspire to lower wages and raise prices in several railway systems under their control but none would trust the others so there must be something in writing laid away in a secret safety deposit box along with sundry bundles of securities put up as forfeit all in the custody of norman when he had worked out in his mind and in fragmentary notes the details of their agreement he was ready for some one to do the clerical work the some one must be absolutely trustworthy as the plain language of the agreement would make clear to the dullest mind dazzling opportunities for profit not only in stock jobbing but also in blackmail he rang for tetlow the head clerk tetlow smooth and sly and smug lacking only courageous initiative to make him a great lawyer but lacking that lacking all tetlow entered and closed the door behind him norman leaned back in his desk chair and laced his fingers behind his head one of your typewriters is a slight blonde girl sits in the corner to the far left if she's still here miss hallowell said tetlow we are letting her go at the end of this week she's nice and ladylike and willing in fact most anxious to please but the work's too difficult for her she's rather rather well not exactly stupid but slow um said norman reflectively there's miss bostwick perhaps she'll do miss bostwick got married last week norman smiled he remembered the girl because she was the oldest and homeliest in the office there's somebody for everybody eh tetlow he was a lighthouse keeper said tetlow there's a story that he advertised for a wife but that may be a joke why not that miss miss halloway mused norman miss hallowell corrected tetlow hallowell yes is she _very_ incompetent not exactly that but business is slackening and she's been only temporary and norman cut him off with send her in you don't wish her dismissed i haven't told her yet oh i'm not interfering in your department do as you like no in this case let her stay on for the present i can use her said tetlow and she gets only ten a week norman frowned he did not like to _hear_ that an establishment in which he had control paid less than decent living wages even if the market price did excuse yes compel it send her in he repeated then as tetlow was about to leave she is trustworthy all our force is i see to that mr norman has she a young man steady company i think they call it she has no friends at all she's extremely shy at least reserved lives with her father an old crank of an analytical chemist over in jersey city she hasn't even a lady friend well send her in a moment later norman looking up from his work saw the dim slim nonentity before him again he leaned back and as he talked with her studied her face to make sure that his first judgment was correct do you stay late every night asked he smilingly she colored a little but enough to bring out the exquisite fineness of her white skin oh i don't mind said she and there was no embarrassment in her manner i've got to learn and doing things over helps nothing equal to it declared norman you've been to school only six weeks confessed she i couldn't afford to stay longer i mean the other sort of school not the typewriting oh yes said she and once more he saw that extraordinary transformation she became all in an instant delicately deliciously lovely with the moving in a way pathetic loveliness of sweet children and sweet flowers her look was mystery but not a mystery of guile she evidently did not wish to have her past brought to view but it was equally apparent that behind it lay hid nothing shameful only the sad perhaps the painful of all the periods of life youth is the best fitted to bear deep sorrows for then the spirit has its full measure of elasticity yet a shadow upon youth is always more moving than the shadows of maturer years those shadows that do not lie upon the surface but are heavy and corroding stains when norman saw this shadow upon her youth so immature looking so helpless looking he felt the first impulse of genuine interest in her perhaps had that shadow happened to fall when he was seeing her as the commonplace and colorless little struggler for bread and seeming doomed speedily to be worsted in the struggle perhaps he would have felt no interest but only the brief qualm of pity that we dare not encourage in ourselves on a journey so beset with hopeless pitiful things as is the journey through life but he had no impulse to question her and with some surprise he noted that his reason for refraining was not the usual reason unwillingness uselessly to add to one's own burdens by inviting the mournful confidences of another no he checked himself because in the manner of this frail and mouselike creature dim though she once more was there appeared a dignity a reserve that made intrusion curiously impossible with an apologetic note in his voice a kind and friendly voice he said please have your typewriter brought in here i want you to do some work for me work that isn't to be spoken of not even to mr tetlow he looked at her with grave penetrating eyes you will not speak of it no replied she and nothing more but she accompanied the simple negative with a clear and honest sincerity of the eyes that set his mind completely at rest he felt that this girl had never in her life told a real lie one of the office boys installed the typewriter and presently norman and the quiet nebulous girl at whom no one would trouble to look a second time were seated opposite each other with the broad table desk between he leaning far back in his desk chair fingers interlocked behind his proud strong looking head she holding sharpened pencil suspended over the stenographic notebook long before she seated herself he had forgotten her except as machine there followed a troubled hour as he dictated ordered erasure redictated ordered re readings skipped back and forth in the effort to frame the secret agreement in the fewest and simplest and least startlingly unlawful words at last he leaned forward with the shine of triumph in his eyes read straight through he commanded she read interrupted occasionally by a sharp order from him to correct some mistake in her notes again he commanded when she translated the last of her notes this time she was not interrupted once when she ended he exclaimed good i don't see how you did it so well nor do i said she you say you are only a beginner i couldn't have done it so well for anyone else said she you are different the remark was worded most flatteringly but it did not sound so he saw that she did not herself understand what she meant by different _he_ understood for he knew the difference between the confused and confusing ordinary minds and such an intelligence as his own simple luminous enlightening all minds however dark so long as they were in the light flooded region around it have i made the meaning clear he asked he hoped she would reply that he had not though this would have indicated a partial defeat in the object he had to put the complex thing so plainly that no one could fail to understand but she answered yes he congratulated himself that his overestimate of her ignorance of affairs had not lured him into giving her the names of the parties at interest to transcribe but did she really understand to test her he said what do you think of it that it's wicked replied she without hesitation and in her small quiet voice he laughed in a way this girl sitting there this inconsequential and negligible atom typefied the masses of mankind against whom that secret agreement was directed they the feeble and powerless ones with their necks ever bent under the yoke of the mighty and their feet ever stumbling into the traps of the crafty they too would utter an impotent wicked if they knew his voice had the note of gentle raillery in it as he said no not wicked just business she was looking down at her book her face expressionless a few moments before he would have said it was an empty face now it seemed to him sphynxlike just business he repeated it is going to take money from those who don't know how to keep or to spend it and give it to those who do know how the money will go for building up civilization instead of for beer and for bargain trough finery to make working men's wives and daughters look cheap and nasty she was silent now do you understand i understand what you said she looked at him as she spoke he wondered how he could have fancied those lack luster eyes beautiful or capable of expression you don't believe it he asked no said she and suddenly in those eyes gazing now into space there came the unutterably melancholy look heavy lidded from heartache weary wise from long long and bitter experiences yet she still looked young girlishly young but it was the youthful look the classic greek sculptors tried to give their young goddesses the youth without beginning or end younger than a baby's older than the oldest of the sons of men he mocked himself for the fancies this queer creature inspired in him but she none the less made him uneasy you don't believe it he repeated no she answered again my father has taught me some things he drummed impatiently on the table he resented her impertinence for like all men of clear and positive mind he regarded contradiction as in one aspect impudent in another aspect evidence of the folly of his contradictor then he gave a short laugh the confessing laugh of the clever man who has tried to believe his own sophistries and has failed well neither do i believe it said he now to get the thing typewritten she seated herself at the machine and set to work as his mind was full of the agreement he could not concentrate on anything else from time to time he glanced at her then he gave up trying to work and sat furtively observing her what a quaint little mystery it was there was in it that is in her not the least charm for him but in all his experience with women he could recall no woman with a comparable development of this curious quality of multiple personalities showing and vanishing in swift succession there had been a time when woman had interested him as a puzzle to be worked out a maze to be explored a temple to be penetrated until one reached the place where the priests manipulated the machinery for the wonders and miracles to fool the devotees into awe some men never get to this stage never realize that their own passions working upon the universal human love of the mysterious are wholly responsible for the cult of woman the sphynx and the sibyl but norman beloved of women had been let by them into their ultimate secret the simple humanness of woman the clap trappery of the oracles miracles and wonders he had discovered that her divine intuitions were mere shrewd guesses where they had any meaning at all that her eloquent silences were screens for ignorance or boredom and so on through the list of legends that prop the feminist cult but this girl this miss hallowell here was a tangible mystery a mystery of physics of chemistry he sat watching her watching the changes as she bent to her work or relaxed or puzzled over the meaning of one of her own hesitating stenographic hieroglyphics watched her as the waning light of the afternoon varied its intensity upon her skin why her very hair partook of this magical quality and altered its tint its degree of vitality even in harmony with the other changes what was the explanation by means of what rare mechanism did her nerve force ebb and flow from moment to moment bringing about these fascinating surface changes in her body could anything even any skin be better made than that superb skin of hers that master work of delicacy and strength of smoothness and color how had it been possible for him to fail to notice it when he was always looking for signs of a good skin down town and up town too in these days of the ravages of pastry and candy what long graceful fingers she had yet what small hands certainly here was a peculiarity that persisted no absurd though it seemed no one way he looked at those hands they were broad and strong another way narrow and gracefully weak he said to himself the man who gets that girl will have solomon's wives rolled into one a harem at the price of a wife or a he left the thought unfinished it seemed an insult to this helpless little creature the more rather than the less cowardly for being unspoken for no doubt her ideas of propriety were firmly conventional about done he asked impatiently she glanced up in a moment i'm sorry to be so slow you're not he assured her truthfully it's my impatience let me see the pages you've finished with them he was able to concentrate his mind when she laid the last page beside his arm he was absorbed did not look at her did not think of her take the machine away said he abruptly he was leaving for the day when he remembered her again he sent for her i forgot to thank you it was good work you will do well all you need is practice and confidence especially confidence he looked at her she seemed frail touchingly frail you are not strong she smiled and in an instant the frailty seemed to have been mere delicacy of build the delicacy that goes with the strength of steel wires or rather of the spider's weaving thread which sustains weights and shocks out of all proportion to its appearance i've never been ill in my life said she not a day again because she was standing before him in full view he noted the peculiar construction of her frame the beautiful lines of length so dextrously combined that her figure as a whole was not tall he said a working woman or man needs health above all thank you again and he nodded a somewhat curt dismissal when she glided away and he was alone behind the closed door he reflected for a moment upon the extraordinary amount of thinking and the extraordinary kind of thinking into which this poor little typewriter girl had beguiled him he soon found the explanation for this vagary into a realm so foreign to a man of his high tastes and ambitions it's because i'm so in love with josephine he decided i've fallen into the sentimental state of all lovers the whole sex becomes novel and interesting and worth while as he left the office unusually late he saw her still at work no doubt doing over again some bungled piece of copying she had her normal and natural look and air the atomic little typewriter unattractive and uninteresting with another smile for his romantic imaginings he forgot her but when he reached the street he remembered her again the threatened blizzard had changed into a heavy rain the swift and sudden currents of air that have made of new york a cave of the winds since the coming of the skyscrapers were darting round corners turning umbrellas inside out tossing women's skirts about their heads reducing all who were abroad to the same level of drenched and sullen wretchedness norman's limousine was waiting at the curb he pausing in the doorway glanced up and down the street had an impulse to return and take the girl home then he smiled satirically at himself her lot condemned her to be out in all weathers it would not be a kindness but an exhibition of smug vanity to shelter her this one night also there was the question of her reputation and the possibility of turning her head perhaps just enough to cause her ruin he sprang across the wind swept rain swept sidewalk and into the limousine whose door was being held open by an obsequious attendant home he said and the door slammed usually these journeys between office and home or club in the evening gave norman a chance for ten or fifteen minutes of sleep he had discovered that this brief dropping of the thread of consciousness gave him a wonderful fresh grip upon the day enabled him to work or play until late into the night without fatigue but that evening his mind was wide awake nor could he fix it upon business it would interest itself only in the hurrying throngs of foot passengers and the ideas they suggested here am i so ran his thoughts here am i tucked away comfortably while all those poor creatures have to plod along in the storm i could afford to be sick they can't and what have i done to deserve this good fortune nothing worse than nothing if i had made my career along the lines of what is honest and right and beneficial to my fellow men i'd probably be plugging home under an umbrella and to a pretty poor excuse for a home but i was too wise to do that i've spent this day as i spend all my days in helping the powerful rich to add to their wealth and power to add to the burdens those poor devils out there in the rain must bear and i'm rewarded with a limousine and all the rest of it these thoughts neither came from nor produced a mood of penitence or of regret even norman was simply indulging in his favorite pastime following without prejudice the leading of a chain of pure logic he despised self deceivers he always kept himself free from prejudice and all its wiles he took life as he found it but he did not excuse it and himself with the familiar hypocrisies that make the comfortable classes preen themselves on being the guardians and saviours of the ignorant incapable masses when old lockyer said one day that this was the function of the upper classes norman retorted perhaps but if so how do they perform it like the brutal old fashioned farm family that takes care of its insane member by keeping him chained in filth in the cellar and once at the federal club by the way norman had joined it had compelled it to receive him just to show his associates how a strong man could break even such a firmly established tradition as that no one who amounted to anything could be elected to a fashionable club in new york once at the federal club old galloway quoted with approval some essayist's remark that every clever human being was looking after and holding above the waves at least fifteen of his weaker fellows norman smiled satirically round at the complacently nodding circle of gray heads and white heads my observation has been said he that every clever chap is shrewd enough to compel at least fifteen of his fellows to wait on him to take care of him do his chores and his dirty work the nodding stopped scowls appeared except on the face of old galloway he grinned he was one of the few examples of a very rich man with a sense of humor norman always thought it was this slight incident that led to his getting the extremely profitable and shady galloway business no norman's mood as he watched the miserable crowds afoot and reflected upon them was neither remorseful nor triumphant he simply noted an interesting fact a commonplace fact of the methods of that sardonic practical joker life because the scheme of things was unjust and stupid because others most others were uncomfortable or worse why should he make himself uncomfortable it would be an absurdity to get out of his limousine and trudge along in the wet and the wind it would be equally absurd to sit in his limousine and be unhappy about the misery of the world i didn't create it and i can't recreate it and if i'm helping to make it worse i'm also hastening the time when it'll be better the great ass must have brains and spirit kicked and cudgeled into it at his house in madison avenue just at the crest of murray hill there was an awning from front door to curb and a carpet beneath it he passed dry and comfortable up the steps a footman in quiet rich livery was waiting to receive him from rising until bedtime up town and down town wherever he went and whatever he was about every possible menial detail of his life was done for him he had nothing to do but think about his own work and keep himself in health rarely did he have even to open or to close a door he used a pen only in signing his name or marking a passage in a law book for some secretary to make a typewritten copy upon most human beings this sort of luxury carried beyond the ordinary and familiar uses of menial service has a speedily enervating effect thinking being the most onerous of all they have it done also they sink into silliness and moral and mental sloth they pass the time at foolish purposeless games indoors and out or they wander aimlessly about the earth chattering with similar mental decrepits much like monkeys adrift in the boughs of a tropical forest but norman had the tenacity and strength to concentrate upon achievement all the powers emancipated by the use of menials wherever menials could be used he employed to advantage the time saved in putting in shirt buttons and lacing shoes and carrying books to and from shelves in this lay one of the important secrets of his success never do for yourself what you can get some one else to do for you as well save yourself for the things only _you_ can do in his household there were three persons and sixteen servants to wait upon them his sister she and her husband clayton fitzhugh were the other two persons his sister was always complaining that there were not enough servants and frederick the most indulgent of brothers was always letting her add to the number it seemed to him that the more help there was the less smoothly the household ran but that did not concern him his mind was saved for more important matters there was no reason why it should concern him could he not compel the dollars to flood in faster than she could bail them out this brother and sister had come to new york fifteen years before when he was twenty two and she nineteen they were from albany where their family had possessed some wealth and much social position for many generations there was the usual queer streak in the norman family an intermittent but fixed habit of some one of them making a low marriage one view of this aberration might have been that there was in the norman blood a tenacious instinct of sturdy and self respecting independence that caused a norman occasionally to do as he pleased instead of as he conventionally ought each time the thing occurred there was a mighty and horrified hubbub throughout the connection but in the broad as the custom is the normans were complacent about the queer streak they thought it kept the family from rotting out and running to seed nothing like an occasional infusion of common blood aunt ursula van bruyten born norman used to say for her norman's sister was named norman's father had developed the queer streak their mother was the daughter of a small farmer and when she met their father was chambermaid in a troy hotel troy then being a largish village as soon as she found herself married and in a position with whose duties she was unfamiliar she set about fitting herself for them with the same diligence and thoroughness which she had shown in learning chamber work in a village hotel she educated herself selected not without shrewdness and carefully put on an assortment of genteel airs finally contrived to make a most creditable appearance was more aristocratic in tastes and in talk than the high mightiest of her relatives by marriage but her son fred was a pinkey in character in boyhood he was noted for his rough and low associates his bosom friends were the son of a jewish junk dealer the son of a colored wash woman and the son of an irish day laborer also the commonness persisted as he grew up instead of seeking aristocratic ease he aspired to a career he had choice of several rich and well born girls but he developed a strong distaste for marriage of any sort and especially for a rich marriage a fortune he was resolved to have but it should be one that belonged to him when he was about ready to enter a law office his father and mother died leaving less than ten thousand dollars in all for his sister and himself his sister hesitated half inclined to marry a stupid second cousin who had thirty thousand a year don't do it ursula fred advised if you must sell out sell for something worth while he laughed in his frank ironical way fact is we've both made up our minds to sell let's go to the best market new york if you don't like it you can come back and marry that fat wit any time you please ursula inspected herself in the glass saw a face and form exceeding fair to look upon she decided to take her brother's advice at twenty she threw over a multi millionaire and married clayton fitzhugh for love clayton with only seventeen thousand a year of course from the standpoint of fashionable ambition seventeen thousand a year in new york is but one remove from tenement house poverty as clayton had no more ability at making money than had ursula herself there was nothing to do but live with norman and take care of him but for this self sacrifice of sisterly affection norman would have been rich at thirty seven as he had to make her rich as well as himself progress toward luxurious independence was slower and there was the house costing nearly fifty thousand a year to keep up there had been a time in norman's career a brief and very early time when with the maternal peasant blood hot in his veins he had entertained the quixotic idea of going into politics on the poor or people's side and fighting for glory only the pressure of expensive living had soon driven this notion clean off norman had almost forgotten that he ever had it was no longer aware how strong it had been in the last year at law school young men of high intelligence and ardent temperament always pass through this period with some a few its glory lingers long after the fire has flickered out before the cool steady breath of worldliness all this time norman has been dressing for dinner he now leaves the third floor and descends toward the library as it still lacks twenty minutes of the dinner hour as he walked along the hall of the second floor a woman's voice called to him that you fred he turned in at his sister's sitting room she was standing at a table smoking a cigarette her tall slim figure looked even taller and slimmer in the tight fitting black satin evening dress her features faintly suggested her relationship to norman she was a handsome woman with a voluptuous discontented mouth what are you worried about sis inquired he how did you know i was worried returned she you always are oh but you're unusually worried to night how did you know that you never smoke just before dinner unless your nerves are ragged what is it money of course no one in new york worries about anything else but _this_ is serious protested she i've been thinking about your marriage and what'll become of clayton and me she halted red with embarrassment norman lit a cigarette himself i ought to have explained said he but i assumed you'd understand fred you know clayton can't make anything and when you marry why what _will_ become of us i've been taking care of clayton's money and of yours i'll continue to do it i think you'll find you're not so badly of you see my position enables me to compel a lot of the financiers to let me in on the ground floor and to warn me in good time before the house falls you'll not miss me ursula she showed her gratitude in her eyes in a slight quiver of the lips in an unsteadiness of tone as she said"
