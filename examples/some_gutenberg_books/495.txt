"1" "direction of the new barns farm from that moment he is plainly in the toils of his obscure and touching destiny there is no doubt after this of what happened to him all is certain now mrs smith's intense terror amy foster's stolid conviction held against the other's nervous attack that the man meant no harm smith's exasperation on his return from darnford market at finding the dog barking himself into a fit the back door locked his wife in hysterics and all for an unfortunate dirty tramp supposed to be even then lurking in his stackyard was he he would teach him to frighten women smith is notoriously hot tempered but the sight of some nondescript and miry creature sitting cross legged amongst a lot of loose straw and swinging itself to and fro like a bear in a cage made him pause then this tramp stood up silently before him one mass of mud and filth from head to foot smith alone amongst his stacks with this apparition in the stormy twilight ringing with the infuriated barking of the dog felt the dread of an inexplicable strangeness but when that being parting with his black hands the long matted locks that hung before his face as you part the two halves of a curtain looked out at him with glistening wild black and white eyes the weirdness of this silent encounter fairly staggered him he had admitted since for the story has been a legitimate subject of conversation about here for years that he made more than one step backwards then a sudden burst of rapid senseless speech persuaded him at once that he had to do with an escaped lunatic in fact that impression never wore off completely smith has not in his heart given up his secret conviction of the man's essential insanity to this very day as the creature approached him jabbering in a most discomposing manner smith unaware that he was being addressed as gracious lord and adjured in god's name to afford food and shelter kept on speaking firmly but gently to it and retreating all the time into the other yard at last watching his chance by a sudden charge he bundled him headlong into the wood lodge and instantly shot the bolt thereupon he wiped his brow though the day was cold he had done his duty to the community by shutting up a wandering and probably dangerous maniac smith isn't a hard man at all but he had room in his brain only for that one idea of lunacy he was not imaginative enough to ask himself whether the man might not be perishing with cold and hunger meantime at first the maniac made a great deal of noise in the lodge mrs smith was screaming upstairs where she had locked herself in her bedroom but amy foster sobbed piteously at the kitchen door wringing her hands and muttering don't don't i daresay smith had a rough time of it that evening with one noise and another and this insane disturbing voice crying obstinately through the door only added to his irritation he couldn't possibly have connected this troublesome lunatic with the sinking of a ship in eastbay of which there had been a rumour in the darnford marketplace and i daresay the man inside had been very near to insanity on that night before his excitement collapsed and he became unconscious he was throwing himself violently about in the dark rolling on some dirty sacks and biting his fists with rage cold hunger amazement and despair he was a mountaineer of the eastern range of the carpathians and the vessel sunk the night before in eastbay was the hamburg emigrant ship _herzogin sophia dorothea_ of appalling memory a few months later we could read in the papers the accounts of the bogus emigration agencies among the sclavonian peasantry in the more remote provinces of austria the object of these scoundrels was to get hold of the poor ignorant people's homesteads and they were in league with the local usurers they exported their victims through hamburg mostly as to the ship i had watched her out of this very window reaching close hauled under short canvas into the bay on a dark threatening afternoon she came to an anchor correctly by the chart off the brenzett coastguard station i remember before the night fell looking out again at the outlines of her spars and rigging that stood out dark and pointed on a background of ragged slaty clouds like another and a slighter spire to the left of the brenzett church tower in the evening the wind rose at midnight i could hear in my bed the terrific gusts and the sounds of a driving deluge about that time the coastguardmen thought they saw the lights of a steamer over the anchoring ground in a moment they vanished but it is clear that another vessel of some sort had tried for shelter in the bay on that awful blind night had rammed the german ship amidships a breach as one of the divers told me afterwards that you could sail a thames barge through and then had gone out either scathless or damaged who shall say but had gone out unknown unseen and fatal to perish mysteriously at sea of her nothing ever came to light and yet the hue and cry that was raised all over the world would have found her out if she had been in existence anywhere on the face of the waters a completeness without a clue and a stealthy silence as of a neatly executed crime characterise this murderous disaster which as you may remember had its gruesome celebrity the wind would have prevented the loudest outcries from reaching the shore there had been evidently no time for signals of distress it was death without any sort of fuss the hamburg ship filling all at once capsized as she sank and at daylight there was not even the end of a spar to be seen above water she was missed of course and at first the coastguardmen surmised that she had either dragged her anchor or parted her cable some time during the night and had been blown out to sea then after the tide turned the wreck must have shifted a little and released some of the bodies because a child a little fair haired child in a red frock came ashore abreast of the martello tower by the afternoon you could see along three miles of beach dark figures with bare legs dashing in and out of the tumbling foam and rough looking men women with hard faces children mostly fair haired were being carried stiff and dripping on stretchers on wattles on ladders in a long procession past the door of the ship inn to be laid out in a row under the north wall of the brenzett church officially the body of the little girl in the red frock is the first thing that came ashore from that ship but i have patients amongst the seafaring population of west colebrook and unofficially i am informed that very early that morning two brothers who went down to look after their cobble hauled up on the beach found a good way from brenzett an ordinary ship's hencoop lying high and dry on the shore with eleven drowned ducks inside their families ate the birds and the hencoop was split into firewood with a hatchet it is possible that a man supposing he happened to be on deck at the time of the accident might have floated ashore on that hencoop he might i admit it is improbable but there was the man and for days nay for weeks it didn't enter our heads that we had amongst us the only living soul that had escaped from that disaster the man himself even when he learned to speak intelligibly could tell us very little he remembered he had felt better after the ship had anchored i suppose and that the darkness the wind and the rain took his breath away this looks as if he had been on deck some time during that night but we mustn't forget he had been taken out of his knowledge that he had been sea sick and battened down below for four days that he had no general notion of a ship or of the sea and therefore could have no definite idea of what was happening to him the rain the wind the darkness he knew he understood the bleating of the sheep and he remembered the pain of his wretchedness and misery his heartbroken astonishment that it was neither seen nor understood his dismay at finding all the men angry and all the women fierce he had approached them as a beggar it is true he said but in his country even if they gave nothing they spoke gently to beggars the children in his country were not taught to throw stones at those who asked for compassion smith's strategy overcame him completely the wood lodge presented the horrible aspect of a dungeon what would be done to him next no wonder that amy foster appeared to his eyes with the aureole of an angel of light the girl had not been able to sleep for thinking of the poor man and in the morning before the smiths were up she slipped out across the back yard holding the door of the wood lodge ajar she looked in and extended to him half a loaf of white bread such bread as the rich eat in my country he used to say at this he got up slowly from amongst all sorts of rubbish stiff hungry trembling miserable and doubtful can you eat this she asked in her soft and timid voice he must have taken her for a gracious lady he devoured ferociously and tears were falling on the crust suddenly he dropped the bread seized her wrist and imprinted a kiss on her hand she was not frightened through his forlorn condition she had observed that he was good looking she shut the door and walked back slowly to the kitchen much later on she told mrs smith who shuddered at the bare idea of being touched by that creature through this act of impulsive pity he was brought back again within the pale of human relations with his new surroundings he never forgot it never that very same morning old mr swaffer smith's nearest neighbour came over to give his advice and ended by carrying him off he stood unsteady on his legs meek and caked over in half dried mud while the two men talked around him in an incomprehensible tongue mrs smith had refused to come downstairs till the madman was off the premises amy foster far from within the dark kitchen watched through the open back door and he obeyed the signs that were made to him to the best of his ability but smith was full of mistrust mind sir it may be all his cunning he cried repeatedly in a tone of warning when mr swaffer started the mare the deplorable being sitting humbly by his side through weakness nearly fell out over the back of the high two wheeled cart swaffer took him straight home and it is then that i come upon the scene i was called in by the simple process of the old man beckoning to me with his forefinger over the gate of his house as i happened to be driving past i got down of course i've got something here he mumbled leading the way to an outhouse at a little distance from his other farm buildings it was there that i saw him first in a long low room taken upon the space of that sort of coach house it was bare and whitewashed with a small square aperture glazed with one cracked dusty pane at its further end he was lying on his back upon a straw pallet they had given him a couple of horse blankets and he seemed to have spent the remainder of his strength in the exertion of cleaning himself he was almost speechless his quick breathing under the blankets pulled up to his chin his glittering restless black eyes reminded me of a wild bird caught in a snare while i was examining him old swaffer stood silently by the door passing the tips of his fingers along his shaven upper lip i gave some directions promised to send a bottle of medicine and naturally made some inquiries smith caught him in the stackyard at new barns said the old chap in his deliberate unmoved manner and as if the other had been indeed a sort of wild animal that's how i came by him quite a curiosity isn't he now tell me doctor you've been all over the world don't you think that's a bit of a hindoo we've got hold of here i was greatly surprised his long black hair scattered over the straw bolster contrasted with the olive pallor of his face it occurred to me he might be a basque it didn't necessarily follow that he should understand spanish but i tried him with the few words i know and also with some french the whispered sounds i caught by bending my ear to his lips puzzled me utterly that afternoon the young ladies from the rectory one of them read goethe with a dictionary and the other had struggled with dante for years coming to see miss swaffer tried their german and italian on him from the doorway they retreated just the least bit scared by the flood of passionate speech which turning on his pallet he let out at them they admitted that the sound was pleasant soft musical but in conjunction with his looks perhaps it was startling so excitable so utterly unlike anything one had ever heard the village boys climbed up the bank to have a peep through the little square aperture everybody was wondering what mr swaffer would do with him he simply kept him swaffer would be called eccentric were he not so much respected they will tell you that mr swaffer sits up as late as ten o'clock at night to read books and they will tell you also that he can write a cheque for two hundred pounds without thinking twice about it he himself would tell you that the swaffers had owned land between this and darnford for these three hundred years he must be eighty five to day but he does not look a bit older than when i first came here he is a great breeder of sheep and deals extensively in cattle he attends market days for miles around in every sort of weather and drives sitting bowed low over the reins his lank grey hair curling over the collar of his warm coat and with a green plaid rug round his legs the calmness of advanced age gives a solemnity to his manner he is clean shaved his lips are thin and sensitive something rigid and monarchal in the set of his features lends a certain elevation to the character of his face he has been known to drive miles in the rain to see a new kind of rose in somebody's garden or a monstrous cabbage grown by a cottager he loves to hear tell of or to be shown something that he calls outlandish perhaps it was just that outlandishness of the man which influenced old swaffer perhaps it was only an inexplicable caprice all i know is that at the end of three weeks i caught sight of smith's lunatic digging in swaffer's kitchen garden they had found out he could use a spade he dug barefooted his black hair flowed over his shoulders i suppose it was swaffer who had given him the striped old cotton shirt but he wore still the national brown cloth trousers in which he had been washed ashore fitting to the leg almost like tights was belted with a broad leathern belt studded with little brass discs and had never yet ventured into the village the land he looked upon seemed to him kept neatly like the grounds round a landowner's house the size of the cart horses struck him with astonishment the roads resembled garden walks and the aspect of the people especially on sundays spoke of opulence he wondered what made them so hardhearted and their children so bold he got his food at the back door carried it in both hands carefully to his outhouse and sitting alone on his pallet would make the sign of the cross before he began beside the same pallet kneeling in the early darkness of the short days he recited aloud the lord's prayer before he slept whenever he saw old swaffer he would bow with veneration from the waist and stand erect while the old man with his fingers over his upper lip surveyed him silently he bowed also to miss swaffer who kept house frugally for her father a broad shouldered big boned woman of forty five with the pocket of her dress full of keys and a grey steady eye she was church as people said while her father was one of the trustees of the baptist chapel and wore a little steel cross at her waist she dressed severely in black in memory of one of the innumerable bradleys of the neighbourhood to whom she had been engaged some twenty five years ago a young farmer who broke his neck out hunting on the eve of the wedding day she had the unmoved countenance of the deaf spoke very seldom and her lips thin like her father's astonished one sometimes by a mysteriously ironic curl these were the people to whom he owed allegiance and an overwhelming loneliness seemed to fall from the leaden sky of that winter without sunshine all the faces were sad he could talk to no one and had no hope of ever understanding anybody it was as if these had been the faces of people from the other world dead people he used to tell me years afterwards upon my word i wonder he did not go mad he didn't know where he was somewhere very far from his mountains somewhere over the water was this america he wondered if it hadn't been for the steel cross at miss swaffer's belt he would not he confessed have known whether he was in a christian country at all he used to cast stealthy glances at it and feel comforted there was nothing here the same as in his country the earth and the water were different there were no images of the redeemer by the roadside the very grass was different and the trees all the trees but the three old norway pines on the bit of lawn before swaffer's house and these reminded him of his country he had been detected once after dusk with his forehead against the trunk of one of them sobbing and talking to himself they had been like brothers to him at that time he affirmed everything else was strange conceive you the kind of an existence overshadowed oppressed by the everyday material appearances as if by the visions of a nightmare at night when he could not sleep he kept on thinking of the girl who gave him the first piece of bread he had eaten in this foreign land she had been neither fierce nor angry nor frightened her face he remembered as the only comprehensible face amongst all these faces that were as closed as mysterious and as mute as the faces of the dead who are possessed of a knowledge beyond the comprehension of the living i wonder whether the memory of her compassion prevented him from cutting his throat but there i suppose i am an old sentimentalist and forget the instinctive love of life which it takes all the strength of an uncommon despair to overcome he did the work which was given him with an intelligence which surprised old swaffer by and by it was discovered that he could help at the ploughing could milk the cows feed the bullocks in the cattle yard and was of some use with the sheep he began to pick up words too very fast and suddenly one fine morning in spring he rescued from an untimely death a grand child of old swaffer swaffer's younger daughter is married to willcox a solicitor and the town clerk of colebrook regularly twice a year they come to stay with the old man for a few days their only child a little girl not three years old at the time ran out of the house alone in her little white pinafore and toddling across the grass of a terraced garden pitched herself over a low wall head first into the horse pond in the yard below our man was out with the waggoner and the plough in the field nearest to the house and as he was leading the team round to begin a fresh furrow he saw through the gap of the gate what for anybody else would have been a mere flutter of something white but he had straight glancing quick far reaching eyes that only seemed to flinch and lose their amazing power before the immensity of the sea he was barefooted and looking as outlandish as the heart of swaffer could desire leaving the horses on the turn to the inexpressible disgust of the waggoner he bounded off going over the ploughed ground in long leaps and suddenly appeared before the mother thrust the child into her arms and strode away the pond was not very deep but still if he had not had such good eyes the child would have perished miserably suffocated in the foot or so of sticky mud at the bottom old swaffer walked out slowly into the field waited till the plough came over to his side had a good look at him and without saying a word went back to the house but from that time they laid out his meals on the kitchen table and at first miss swaffer all in black and with an inscrutable face would come and stand in the doorway of the living room to see him make a big sign of the cross before he fell to i believe that from that day too swaffer began to pay him regular wages i can't follow step by step his development he cut his hair short was seen in the village and along the road going to and fro to his work like any other man children ceased to shout after him he became aware of social differences but remained for a long time surprised at the bare poverty of the churches among so much wealth he couldn't understand either why they were kept shut up on week days there was nothing to steal in them was it to keep people from praying too often the rectory took much notice of him about that time and i believe the young ladies attempted to prepare the ground for his conversion they could not however break him of his habit of crossing himself but he went so far as to take off the string with a couple of brass medals the size of a sixpence a tiny metal cross and a square sort of scapulary which he wore round his neck he hung them on the wall by the side of his bed and he was still to be heard every evening reciting the lord's prayer in incomprehensible words and in a slow fervent tone as he had heard his old father do at the head of all the kneeling family big and little on every evening of his life and though he wore corduroys at work and a slop made pepper and salt suit on sundays strangers would turn round to look after him on the road his foreignness had a peculiar and indelible stamp at last people became used to see him but they never became used to him his rapid skimming walk his swarthy complexion his hat cocked on the left ear his habit on warm evenings of wearing his coat over one shoulder like a hussar's dolman his manner of leaping over the stiles not as a feat of agility but in the ordinary course of progression all these peculiarities were as one may say so many causes of scorn and offence to the inhabitants of the village _they_ wouldn't in their dinner hour lie flat on their backs on the grass to stare at the sky neither did they go about the fields screaming dismal tunes many times have i heard his high pitched voice from behind the ridge of some sloping sheep walk a voice light and soaring like a lark's but with a melancholy human note over our fields that hear only the song of birds and i should be startled myself ah he was different innocent of heart and full of good will which nobody wanted this castaway that like a man transplanted into another planet was separated by an immense space from his past and by an immense ignorance from his future his quick fervent utterance positively shocked everybody an excitable devil they called him one evening in the tap room of the coach and horses having drunk some whisky he upset them all by singing a love song of his country they hooted him down and he was pained but preble the lame wheelwright and vincent the fat blacksmith and the other notables too wanted to drink their evening beer in peace on another occasion he tried to show them how to dance the dust rose in clouds from the sanded floor he leaped straight up amongst the deal tables struck his heels together squatted on one heel in front of old preble shooting out the other leg uttered wild and exulting cries jumped up to whirl on one foot snapping his fingers above his head and a strange carter who was having a drink in there began to swear and cleared out with his half pint in his hand into the bar but when suddenly he sprang upon a table and continued to dance among the glasses the landlord interfered he didn't want any acrobat tricks in the taproom they laid their hands on him having had a glass or two mr swaffer's foreigner tried to expostulate was ejected forcibly got a black eye i believe he felt the hostility of his human surroundings but he was tough tough in spirit too as well as in body only the memory of the sea frightened him with that vague terror that is left by a bad dream his home was far away and he did not want now to go to america i had often explained to him that there is no place on earth where true gold can be found lying ready and to be got for the trouble of the picking up how then he asked could he ever return home with empty hands when there had been sold a cow two ponies and a bit of land to pay for his going his eyes would fill with tears and averting them from the immense shimmer of the sea he would throw himself face down on the grass but sometimes cocking his hat with a little conquering air he would defy my wisdom he had found his bit of true gold that was amy foster's heart which was a golden heart and soft to people's misery he would say in the accents of overwhelming conviction he was called yanko he had explained that this meant little john but as he would also repeat very often that he was a mountaineer some word sounding in the dialect of his country like goorall he got it for his surname and this is the only trace of him that the succeeding ages may find in the marriage register of the parish there it stands yanko goorall in the rector's handwriting the crooked cross made by the castaway a cross whose tracing no doubt seemed to him the most solemn part of the whole ceremony is all that remains now to perpetuate the memory of his name his courtship had lasted some time ever since he got his precarious footing in the community it began by his buying for amy foster a green satin ribbon in darnford this was what you did in his country you bought a ribbon at a jew's stall on a fair day i don't suppose the girl knew what to do with it but he seemed to think that his honourable intentions could not be mistaken it was only when he declared his purpose to get married that i fully understood how for a hundred futile and inappreciable reasons how shall i say odious he was to all the countryside every old woman in the village was up in arms smith coming upon him near the farm promised to break his head for him if he found him about again but he twisted his little black moustache with such a bellicose air and rolled such big black fierce eyes at smith that this promise came to nothing smith however told the girl that she must be mad to take up with a man who was surely wrong in his head all the same when she heard him in the gloaming whistle from beyond the orchard a couple of bars of a weird and mournful tune she would drop whatever she had in her hand she would leave mrs smith in the middle of a sentence and she would run out"
