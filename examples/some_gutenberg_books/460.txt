the thing in his pocket had loosened and he tightened it i have some more money in my purse he said deliberately i meant to give it away before going i want to give it to people who need it very much she gave him one of the sly squinting glances deservin cases she put it to him in brazen mockery i don't care he answered slowly and heavily i don't care a damn her face changed exactly as he had seen it change on the bridge when she had drawn nearer to him its ugly hardness suddenly looked human and that she could look human was fantastic ow much ave yer she asked ow much is it about ten pounds she stopped and stared at him with open mouth gawd she broke out ten pounds d send apple blossom court to eving leastways it'd take some of it out o ell take me to it he said roughly take me she began to walk quickly breathing fast the fog was lighter and it was no longer a blinding thing a question occurred to dart why don't you ask me to give the money to you he said bluntly dunno she answered as bluntly but after taking a few steps farther she spoke again i m cheerfler than most of em she elaborated if yer born cheerfle yer can stand things when i gets a job nussin women's bibies they don't cry when i andles em i gets many a bite an a copper cos o that folks likes yer i shall get on better than polly when i'm old enough to go on the street the organ of whose lagging sick pumpings antony dart had scarcely been aware for months gave a sudden leap in his breast his blood actually hastened its pace and ran through his veins instead of crawling a distinct physical effect of an actual mental condition it was produced upon him by the mere matter of fact ordinariness of her tone he had never been a sentimental man and had long ceased to be a feeling one but at that moment something emotional and normal happened to him you expect to live in that way he said ain't nothin else fer me to do wisht i was better lookin but i've got a lot of air clawing her mop an it's red one day chuckling a gent ses to me he ses oh yer'll do yer an ugly little devil but ye are a devil she was leading him through a narrow filthy back street and she stopped grinning up in his face i say mister she wheedled let's stop at the cawfee stand it's up this way when he acceded and followed her she quickly turned a corner they were in another lane thick with fog which flared with the flame of torches stuck in costers barrows which stood here and there barrows with fried fish upon them barrows with second hand looking vegetables and others piled with more than second hand looking garments trade was not driving but near one or two of them dirty ill used looking women a man or so and a few children stood at a corner which led into a black hole of a court a coffee stand was stationed in charge of a burly ruffian in corduroys come along said the girl there it is it ain't strong but it's ot she sidled up to the stand drawing dart with her as if glad of his protection ello barney she said ere's a gent warnts a mug o yer best i've ad a bit o luck an i wants one mesself garn growled barney you an yer luck gent may want a mug but y'd show yer money fust strewth i've got it y aint got the chinge fer wot i ave in me and ere as e mister show it taunted the man and then turning to dart yer wants a mug o cawfee yes the girl held out her hand cautiously the piece of gold lying upon its palm look ere she said there were two or three men slouching about the stand suddenly a hand darted from between two of them who stood nearest the sovereign was snatched a screamed oath from the girl rent the thick air and a forlorn enough scarecrow of a young fellow sprang away the blood leaped in antony dart's veins again and he sprang after him in a wholly normal passion of indignation a thousand years ago as it seemed to him he had been a good runner this man was not one and want of food had weakened him dart went after him with strides which astonished himself up the street into an alley and out of it a dozen yards more and into a court and the man wheeled with a hoarse baffled curse the place had no outlet hell was all the creature said dart took him by his greasy collar even the brief rush had left him feeling like a living thing which was a new sensation give it up he ordered the thief looked at him with a half laugh and obeyed as if he felt the uselessness of a struggle he was not more than twenty five years old and his eyes were cavernous with want he had the face of a man who might have belonged to a better class when he had uttered the exclamation invoking the infernal regions he had not dropped the aspirate i m as hungry as she is he raved hungry enough to rob a child beggar said dart hungry enough to rob a starving old woman or a baby with a defiant snort wolf hungry tiger hungry hungry enough to cut throats he whirled himself loose and leaned his body against the wall turning his face toward it suddenly he made a choking sound and began to sob hell he choked i'll give it up i'll give it up what a figure what a figure as he swung against the blackened wall his scarecrow clothes hanging on him their once decent material making their pinning together of buttonless places their looseness and rents showing dirty linen more abject than any other squalor could have made them antony dart's blood still running warm and well was doing its normal work among the brain cells which had stirred so evilly through the night when he had seized the fellow by the collar his hand had left his pocket he thrust it into another pocket and drew out some silver go and get yourself some food he said as much as you can eat then go and wait for me at the place they call apple blossom court i don't know where it is but i am going there i want to hear how you came to this will you come the thief lurched away from the wall and toward him he stared up into his eyes through the fog the tears had smeared his cheekbones god he said will i come look and see if i'll come dart looked yes you'll come he answered and he gave him the money i m going back to the coffee stand the thief stood staring after him as he went out of the court dart was speaking to himself i don't know why i did it he said but the thing had to be done in the street he turned into he came upon the robbed girl running panting and crying she uttered a shout and flung herself upon him clutching his coat gawd she sobbed hysterically i thort i'd lost yer i thort i'd lost all of it i did strewth i m glad i've found yer and she stopped choking with her sobs and sniffs rubbing her face in her sack here is your sovereign dart said handing it to her she dropped the corner of the sack and looked up with a queer laugh did yer find a copper did yer give him in charge no answered dart he was worse off than you he was starving i took this from him but i gave him some money and told him to meet us at apple blossom court she stopped short and drew back a pace to stare up at him well she gave forth y are a queer one and yet in the amazement on her face he perceived a remote dawning of an understanding of the meaning of the thing he had done he had spoken like a man in a dream he felt like a man in a dream being led in the thick mist from place to place he was led back to the coffee stand where now barney the proprietor was pouring out coffee for a hoarse voiced coster girl with a draggled feather in her hat who greeted their arrival hilariously hello glad she cried out got yer suvrink back glad it seemed to be the creature's wild name nodded but held close to her companion's side clutching his coat let's go in there an change it she said nodding toward a small pork and ham shop near by an then yer can take care of it for me what did she call you antony dart asked her as they went glad don't know as i ever ad a nime o me own but a little cove as went once to the pantermine told me about a young lady as was fairy queen an er name was gladys beverly st john so i called mesself that no one never said it all at onct they don't never say nothin but glad i'm glad enough this mornin chuckling again avin the luck to come up with you mister never had luck like it afore they went into the pork and ham shop and changed the sovereign there was cooked food in the windows roast pork and boiled ham and corned beef she bought slices of pork and beef and of suet pudding with a few currants sprinkled through it will yer elp me to carry it she inquired i'll ave to get a few pen'worth o coal an wood an a screw o tea an sugar my wig wot a feed me an polly'll ave as they returned to the coffee stand she broke more than once into a hop of glee barney had changed his mind concerning her a solid sovereign which must be changed and a companion whose shabby gentility was absolute grandeur when compared with his present surroundings made a difference she received her mug of coffee and thick slice of bread and dripping with a grin and swallowed the hot sweet liquid down in ecstatic gulps ain't i in luck she said handing her mug back when it was empty gi me another barney antony dart drank coffee also and ate bread and dripping the coffee was hot and the bread and dripping dashed with salt quite eatable he had needed food and felt the better for it come on mister said glad when their meal was ended i want to get back to polly an there's coal and bread and things to buy she hurried him along breaking her pace with hops at intervals she darted into dirty shops and brought out things screwed up in paper she went last into a cellar and returned carrying a small sack of coal over her shoulders bought sack an all she said elatedly a sack's a good thing to ave let me carry it for you said antony dart spile yer coat with her sidelong upward glance i don't care he answered i don't care a damn the final expletive was totally unnecessary but it meant a thing he did not say whatsoever was thrusting him this way and that speaking through his speech leading him to do things he had not dreamed of doing should have its will with him he had been fastened to the skirts of this beggar imp and he would go on to the end and do what was to be done this day it was part of the dream the sack of coal was over his shoulder when they turned into apple blossom court it would have been a black hole on a sunny day and now it was like hades lit grimly by a gas jet or two small and flickering with the orange haze about them filthy flagging murky doorways broken steps and broken windows stuffed with rags and the smell of the sewers let loose had apple blossom court glad with the wealth of the pork and ham shop and other riches in her arms entered a repellent doorway in a spirit of great good cheer and dart followed her past a room where a drunken woman lay sleeping with her head on a table a child pulling at her dress and crying up a stairway with broken balusters and breaking steps through a landing upstairs again and up still farther until they reached the top glad stopped before a door and shook the handle crying out s only me polly you can open it she added to dart in an undertone she as to keep it locked no knowin who'd want to get in polly shaking the door handle again polly's only me the door opened slowly on the other side of it stood a girl with a dimpled round face which was quite pale under one of her childishly vacant blue eyes was a discoloration and her curly fair hair was tucked up on the top of her head in a knot as she took in the fact of antony dart's presence her chin began to quiver i ain't fit to to see no one she stammered pitifully why did you glad why did you ain't no arm in im said glad e's one o the friendly ones e give me a suvrink look wot i've got hopping about as she showed her parcels you need not be afraid of me antony dart said he paused a second staring at her and suddenly added poor little wretch her look was so scared and uncertain a thing that he walked away from her and threw the sack of coal on the hearth a small grate with broken bars hung loosely in the fireplace a battered tin kettle tilted drunkenly near it a mattress from the holes in whose ticking straw bulged lay on the floor in a corner with some old sacks thrown over it glad had without doubt borrowed her shoulder covering from the collection the garret was as cold as the grave and almost as dark the fog hung in it thickly there were crevices enough through which it could penetrate antony dart knelt down on the hearth and drew matches from his pocket we ought to have brought some paper he said glad ran forward wot a gent ye are she cried y ain't never goin to light it yes she ran back to the rickety table and collected the scraps of paper which had held her purchases they were small but useful that wot was round the sausage an the puddin's greasy she exulted polly hung over the table and trembled at the sight of meat and bread plainly she did not understand what was happening the greased paper set light to the wood and the wood to the coal all three flared and blazed with a sound of cheerful crackling the blaze threw out its glow as finely as if it had been set alight to warm a better place the wonder of a fire is like the wonder of a soul this one changed the murk and gloom to brightness and the deadly damp and cold to warmth it drew the girl polly from the table despite her fears she turned involuntarily made two steps toward it and stood gazing while its light played on her face glad whirled and ran to the hearth ye've put on a lot she cried but oh my gawd don't it warm yer come on polly come on she dragged out a wooden stool an empty soap box and bundled the sacks into a heap to be sat upon she swept the things from the table and set them in their paper wrappings on the floor let's all sit down close to it close she said an get warm an eat an eat she was the leaven which leavened the lump of their humanity what this leaven is who has found out but she little rat of the gutter was formed of it and her mere pure animal joy in the temporary animal comfort of the moment stirred and uplifted them from their depths iii they drew near and sat upon the substitutes for seats in a circle and the fire threw up flame and made a glow in the fog hanging in the black hole of a room it was glad who set the battered kettle on and when it boiled made tea the other two watched her being under her spell she handed out slices of bread and sausage and pudding on bits of paper polly fed with tremulous haste glad herself with rejoicing and exulting in flavors antony dart ate bread and meat as he had eaten the bread and dripping at the stall accepting his normal hunger as part of the dream suddenly glad paused in the midst of a huge bite mister she said p'raps that cove's waitin fer yer let's ave im in i'll go and fetch im she was getting up but dart was on his feet first i must go he said he is expecting me and aw said glad lemme go along o yer mister jest to show there's no ill feelin very well he answered it was she who led and he who followed at the door she stopped and looked round with a grin keep up the fire polly she threw back ain't it warm and cheerful it'll do the cove good to see it she led the way down the black unsafe stairway she always led outside the fog had thickened again but she went through it as if she could see her way at the entrance to the court the thief was standing leaning against the wall with fevered unhopeful waiting in his eyes he moved miserably when he saw the girl and she called out to reassure him i ain't up to no arm she said i on'y come with the gent antony dart spoke to him did you get food the man shook his head i turned faint after you left me and when i came to i was afraid i might miss you he answered i daren't lose my chance i bought some bread and stuffed it in my pocket i've been eating it while i've stood here come back with us said dart we are in a place where we have some food he spoke mechanically and was aware that he did so he was a pawn pushed about upon the board of this day's life come on said the girl yer can get enough to last fer three days she guided them back through the fog until they entered the murky doorway again then she almost ran up the staircase to the room they had left when the door opened the thief fell back a pace as before an unexpected thing it was the flare of firelight which struck upon his eyes he passed his hand over them a fire he said i haven't seen one for a week coming out of the blackness it gives a man a start improvident joy gleamed in glad's eyes we'll be warm onct she chuckled if we ain't never warm agaen she drew her circle about the hearth again the thief took the place next to her and she handed out food to him a big slice of meat bread a thick slice of pudding fill yerself up she said then ye'll feel like yer can talk the man tried to eat his food with decorum some recollection of the habits of better days restraining him but starved nature was too much for him his hands shook his eyes filled his teeth tore the rest of the circle tried not to look at him glad and polly occupied themselves with their own food antony dart gazed at the fire here he sat warming himself in a loft with a beggar a thief and a helpless thing of the street he had come out to buy a pistol its weight still hung in his overcoat pocket and he had reached this place of whose existence he had an hour ago not dreamed each step which had led him had seemed a simple inevitable thing for which he had apparently been responsible but which he knew yes somehow he knew he had of his own volition neither planned nor meant yet here he sat a part of the lives of the beggar the thief and the poor thing of the street what did it mean tell me he said to the thief how you came here by this time the young fellow had fed himself and looked less like a wolf it was to be seen now that he had blue gray eyes which were dreamy and young i have always been inventing things he said a little huskily i did it when i was a child i always seemed to see there might be a way of doing a thing better getting more power when other boys were playing games i was sitting in corners trying to build models out of wire and string and old boxes and tin cans i often thought i saw the way to things but i was always too poor to get what was needed to work them out twice i heard of men making great names and for tunes because they had been able to finish what i could have finished if i had had a few pounds it used to drive me mad and break my heart his hands clenched themselves and his huskiness grew thicker there was a man catching his breath who leaped to the top of the ladder and set the whole world talking and writing and i had done the thing first i swear i had it was all clear in my brain and i was half mad with joy over it but i could not afford to work it out he could so to the end of time it will be his he struck his fist upon his knee aw the deep little drawl was a groan from glad i got a place in an office at last i worked hard and they began to trust me i had a new idea it was a big one i needed money to work it out i i remembered what had happened before i felt like a poor fellow running a race for his life i knew i could pay back ten times a hundred times what i took you took money said dart the thief's head dropped no i was caught when i was taking it i wasn't sharp enough someone came in and saw me and there was a crazy row i was sent to prison there was no more trying after that it's nearly two years since and i've been hanging about the streets and falling lower and lower i've run miles panting after cabs with luggage in them and not had strength to carry in the boxes when they stopped i've starved and slept out of doors but the thing i wanted to work out is in my mind all the time like some machine tearing round it wants to be finished it never will be that's all glad was leaning forward staring at him her roughened hands with the smeared cracks on them clasped round her knees things as to be finished she said they finish theirselves how do you know dart turned on her dunno ow i know but i do when things begin they finish it's like a wheel rollin down an ill her sharp eyes fixed themselves on dart's all of us'll finish somethin cos we've begun you will polly will e will i will she stopped with a sudden sheepish chuckle and dropped her forehead on her knees giggling dunno wot i m talking about she said but it's true dart began to understand that it was and he also saw that this ragged thing who knew nothing whatever looked out on the world with the eyes of a seer though she was ignorant of the meaning of her own knowledge it was a weird thing he turned to the girl polly tell me how you came here he said he spoke in a low voice and gently he did not want to frighten her but he wanted to know how she had begun when she lifted her childish eyes to his her chin began to shake for some reason she did not question his right to ask what he would she answered him meekly as her fingers fumbled with the stuff of her dress i lived in the country with my mother she said we was very happy together in the spring there was primroses and and lambs i can't abide to look at the sheep in the park these days they remind me so there was a girl in the village got a place in town and came back and told us all about it it made me silly i wanted to come here too i i came she put her arm over her face and began to sob she can't tell you said glad there was a swell in the ouse made love to her she used to carry up coals to is parlor an e talked to er e ad a wye with im polly broke into a smothered wail oh i did love him so i did she cried i'd have let him walk over me i'd have let him kill me e nearly did it said glad e went away sudden an she's never eard word of im since from under polly's face hiding arm came broken words i couldn't tell my mother i did not know how i was too frightened and ashamed now it's too late i shall never see my mother again and it seems as if all the lambs and primroses in the world was dead oh they're dead they're dead and i wish i was too glad's eyes winked rapidly and she gave a hoarse little cough to clear her throat her arms still clasping her knees she hitched herself closer to the girl and gave her a nudge with her elbow buck up polly she said we ain't none of"
