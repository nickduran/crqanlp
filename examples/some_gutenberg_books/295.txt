the length of the intervening passage then it was evident that she had not been in bed and asleep since she was dressed when she roused the house and her bed had not been slept in moreover the door at the bottom of the stairs was ajar and the key in the lock and it was noticed by the chaplain an observant man that the dress she wore was stained with blood about the knees and that there were traces of small blood stained hands low down on the staircase walls so that it was conjectured that she had really been at the postern door when her husband fell and feeling her way up to him in the darkness on her hands and knees had been stained by his blood dripping down on her of course it was argued on the other side that the blood marks on her dress might have been caused by her kneeling down by her husband when she rushed out of her room but there was the open door below and the fact that the fingermarks in the staircase all pointed upward the accused held to her statement for the first two days in spite of its improbability but on the third day word was brought to her that herve de lanrivain a young nobleman of the neighbourhood had been arrested for complicity in the crime two or three witnesses thereupon came forward to say that it was known throughout the country that lanrivain had formerly been on good terms with the lady of cornault but that he had been absent from brittany for over a year and people had ceased to associate their names the witnesses who made this statement were not of a very reputable sort one was an old herb gatherer suspected of witch craft another a drunken clerk from a neighbouring parish the third a half witted shepherd who could be made to say anything and it was clear that the prosecution was not satisfied with its case and would have liked to find more definite proof of lanrivain's complicity than the statement of the herb gatherer who swore to having seen him climbing the wall of the park on the night of the murder one way of patching out incomplete proofs in those days was to put some sort of pressure moral or physical on the accused person it is not clear what pressure was put on anne de cornault but on the third day when she was brought into court she appeared weak and wandering and after being encouraged to collect herself and speak the truth on her honour and the wounds of her blessed redeemer she confessed that she had in fact gone down the stairs to speak with herve de lanrivain who denied everything and had been surprised there by the sound of her husband's fall that was better and the prosecution rubbed its hands with satisfaction the satisfaction increased when various dependents living at kerfol were induced to say with apparent sincerity that during the year or two preceding his death their master had once more grown uncertain and irascible and subject to the fits of brooding silence which his household had learned to dread before his second marriage this seemed to show that things had not been going well at kerfol though no one could be found to say that there had been any signs of open disagreement between husband and wife anne de cornault when questioned as to her reason for going down at night to open the door to herve de lanrivain made an answer which must have sent a smile around the court she said it was because she was lonely and wanted to talk with the young man was this the only reason she was asked and replied yes by the cross over your lordships heads but why at midnight the court asked because i could see him in no other way i can see the exchange of glances across the ermine collars under the crucifix anne de cornault further questioned said that her married life had been extremely lonely desolate was the word she used it was true that her husband seldom spoke harshly to her but there were days when he did not speak at all it was true that he had never struck or threatened her but he kept her like a prisoner at kerfol and when he rode away to morlaix or quimper or rennes he set so close a watch on her that she could not pick a flower in the garden without having a waiting woman at her heels i am no queen to need such honours she once said to him and he had answered that a man who has a treasure does not leave the key in the lock when he goes out then take me with you she urged but to this he said that towns were pernicious places and young wives better off at their own firesides but what did you want to say to herve de lanrivain the court asked and she answered to ask him to take me away ah you confess that you went down to him with adulterous thoughts no then why did you want him to take you away because i was afraid for my life of whom were you afraid of my husband why were you afraid of your husband because he had strangled my little dog another smile must have passed around the court room in days when any nobleman had a right to hang his peasants and most of them exercised it pinching a pet animal's wind pipe was nothing to make a fuss about at this point one of the judges who appears to have had a certain sympathy for the accused suggested that she should be allowed to explain herself in her own way and she thereupon made the following statement the first years of her marriage had been lonely but her husband had not been unkind to her if she had had a child she would not have been unhappy but the days were long and it rained too much it was true that her husband whenever he went away and left her brought her a handsome present on his return but this did not make up for the loneliness at least nothing had till he brought her the little brown dog from the east after that she was much less unhappy her husband seemed pleased that she was so fond of the dog he gave her leave to put her jewelled bracelet around its neck and to keep it always with her one day she had fallen asleep in her room with the dog at her feet as his habit was her feet were bare and resting on his back suddenly she was waked by her husband he stood beside her smiling not unkindly you look like my great grandmother juliane de cornault lying in the chapel with her feet on a little dog he said the analogy sent a chill through her but she laughed and answered well when i am dead you must put me beside her carved in marble with my dog at my feet oho we'll wait and see he said laughing also but with his black brows close together the dog is the emblem of fidelity and do you doubt my right to lie with mine at my feet when i'm in doubt i find out he answered i am an old man he added and people say i make you lead a lonely life but i swear you shall have your monument if you earn it and i swear to be faithful she returned if only for the sake of having my little dog at my feet not long afterward he went on business to the quimper assizes and while he was away his aunt the widow of a great nobleman of the duchy came to spend a night at kerfol on her way to the pardon of ste barbe she was a woman of great piety and consequence and much respected by yves de cornault and when she proposed to anne to go with her to ste barbe no one could object and even the chaplain declared himself in favour of the pilgrimage so anne set out for ste barbe and there for the first time she talked with herve de lanrivain he had come once or twice to kerfol with his father but she had never before exchanged a dozen words with him they did not talk for more than five minutes now it was under the chestnuts as the procession was coming out of the chapel he said i pity you and she was surprised for she had not supposed that any one thought her an object of pity he added call for me when you need me and she smiled a little but was glad afterward and thought often of the meeting she confessed to having seen him three times afterward not more how or where she would not say one had the impression that she feared to implicate some one their meetings had been rare and brief and at the last he had told her that he was starting the next day for a foreign country on a mission which was not without peril and might keep him for many months absent he asked her for a remembrance and she had none to give him but the collar about the little dog's neck she was sorry afterward that she had given it but he was so unhappy at going that she had not had the courage to refuse her husband was away at the time when he returned a few days later he picked up the little dog to pet it and noticed that its collar was missing his wife told him that the dog had lost it in the undergrowth of the park and that she and her maids had hunted a whole day for it it was true she explained to the court that she had made the maids search for the necklet they all believed the dog had lost it in the park her husband made no comment and that evening at supper he was in his usual mood between good and bad you could never tell which he talked a good deal describing what he had seen and done at rennes but now and then he stopped and looked hard at her and when she went to bed she found her little dog strangled on her pillow the little thing was dead but still warm she stooped to lift it and her distress turned to horror when she discovered that it had been strangled by twisting twice round its throat the necklet she had given to lanrivain the next morning at dawn she buried the dog in the garden and hid the necklet in her breast she said nothing to her husband then or later and he said nothing to her but that day he had a peasant hanged for stealing a faggot in the park and the next day he nearly beat to death a young horse he was breaking winter set in and the short days passed and the long nights one by one and she heard nothing of herve de lanrivain it might be that her husband had killed him or merely that he had been robbed of the necklet day after day by the hearth among the spinning maids night after night alone on her bed she wondered and trembled sometimes at table her husband looked across at her and smiled and then she felt sure that lanrivain was dead she dared not try to get news of him for she was sure her husband would find out if she did she had an idea that he could find out anything even when a witch woman who was a noted seer and could show you the whole world in her crystal came to the castle for a night's shelter and the maids flocked to her anne held back the winter was long and black and rainy one day in yves de cornault's absence some gypsies came to kerfol with a troop of performing dogs anne bought the smallest and cleverest a white dog with a feathery coat and one blue and one brown eye it seemed to have been ill treated by the gypsies and clung to her plaintively when she took it from them that evening her husband came back and when she went to bed she found the dog strangled on her pillow after that she said to herself that she would never have another dog but one bitter cold evening a poor lean greyhound was found whining at the castle gate and she took him in and forbade the maids to speak of him to her husband she hid him in a room that no one went to smuggled food to him from her own plate made him a warm bed to lie on and petted him like a child yves de cornault came home and the next day she found the greyhound strangled on her pillow she wept in secret but said nothing and resolved that even if she met a dog dying of hunger she would never bring him into the castle but one day she found a young sheep dog a brindled puppy with good blue eyes lying with a broken leg in the snow of the park yves de cornault was at rennes and she brought the dog in warmed and fed it tied up its leg and hid it in the castle till her husband's return the day before she gave it to a peasant woman who lived a long way off and paid her handsomely to care for it and say nothing but that night she heard a whining and scratching at her door and when she opened it the lame puppy drenched and shivering jumped up on her with little sobbing barks she hid him in her bed and the next morning was about to have him taken back to the peasant woman when she heard her husband ride into the court she shut the dog in a chest and went down to receive him an hour or two later when she returned to her room the puppy lay strangled on her pillow after that she dared not make a pet of any other dog and her loneliness became almost unendurable sometimes when she crossed the court of the castle and thought no one was looking she stopped to pat the old pointer at the gate but one day as she was caressing him her husband came out of the chapel and the next day the old dog was gone this curious narrative was not told in one sitting of the court or received without impatience and incredulous comment it was plain that the judges were surprised by its puerility and that it did not help the accused in the eyes of the public it was an odd tale certainly but what did it prove that yves de cornault disliked dogs and that his wife to gratify her own fancy persistently ignored this dislike as for pleading this trivial disagreement as an excuse for her relations whatever their nature with her supposed accomplice the argument was so absurd that her own lawyer manifestly regretted having let her make use of it and tried several times to cut short her story but she went on to the end with a kind of hypnotized insistence as though the scenes she evoked were so real to her that she had forgotten where she was and imagined herself to be re living them at length the judge who had previously shown a certain kindness to her said leaning forward a little one may suppose from his row of dozing colleagues then you would have us believe that you murdered your husband because he would not let you keep a pet dog i did not murder my husband who did then herve de lanrivain no who then can you tell us yes i can tell you the dogs at that point she was carried out of the court in a swoon it was evident that her lawyer tried to get her to abandon this line of defense possibly her explanation whatever it was had seemed convincing when she poured it out to him in the heat of their first private colloquy but now that it was exposed to the cold daylight of judicial scrutiny and the banter of the town he was thoroughly ashamed of it and would have sacrificed her without a scruple to save his professional reputation but the obstinate judge who perhaps after all was more inquisitive than kindly evidently wanted to hear the story out and she was ordered the next day to continue her deposition she said that after the disappearance of the old watch dog nothing particular happened for a month or two her husband was much as usual she did not remember any special incident but one evening a pedlar woman came to the castle and was selling trinkets to the maids she had no heart for trinkets but she stood looking on while the women made their choice and then she did not know how but the pedlar coaxed her into buying for herself an odd pear shaped pomander with a strong scent in it she had once seen something of the kind on a gypsy woman she had no desire for the pomander and did not know why she had bought it the pedlar said that whoever wore it had the power to read the future but she did not really believe that or care much either however she bought the thing and took it up to her room where she sat turning it about in her hand then the strange scent attracted her and she began to wonder what kind of spice was in the box she opened it and found a grey bean rolled in a strip of paper and on the paper she saw a sign she knew and a message from herve de lanrivain saying that he was at home again and would be at the door in the court that night after the moon had set she burned the paper and then sat down to think it was nightfall and her husband was at home she had no way of warning lanrivain and there was nothing to do but to wait at this point i fancy the drowsy courtroom beginning to wake up even to the oldest hand on the bench there must have been a certain aesthetic relish in picturing the feelings of a woman on receiving such a message at night fall from a man living twenty miles away to whom she had no means of sending a warning she was not a clever woman i imagine and as the first result of her cogitation she appears to have made the mistake of being that evening too kind to her husband she could not ply him with wine according to the traditional expedient for though he drank heavily at times he had a strong head and when he drank beyond its strength it was because he chose to and not because a woman coaxed him not his wife at any rate she was an old story by now as i read the case i fancy there was no feeling for her left in him but the hatred occasioned by his supposed dishonour at any rate she tried to call up her old graces but early in the evening he complained of pains and fever and left the hall to go up to his room his servant carried him a cup of hot wine and brought back word that he was sleeping and not to be disturbed and an hour later when anne lifted the tapestry and listened at his door she heard his loud regular breathing she thought it might be a feint and stayed a long time barefooted in the cold passage her ear to the crack but the breathing went on too steadily and naturally to be other than that of a man in a sound sleep she crept back to her room reassured and stood in the window watching the moon set through the trees of the park the sky was misty and starless and after the moon went down the night was pitch black she knew the time had come and stole along the passage past her husband's door where she stopped again to listen to his breathing to the top of the stairs there she paused a moment and assured herself that no one was following her then she began to go down the stairs in the darkness they were so steep and winding that she had to go very slowly for fear of stumbling her one thought was to get the door unbolted tell lanrivain to make his escape and hasten back to her room she had tried the bolt earlier in the evening and managed to put a little grease on it but nevertheless when she drew it it gave a squeak not loud but it made her heart stop and the next minute overhead she heard a noise what noise the prosecution interposed my husband's voice calling out my name and cursing me what did you hear after that a terrible scream and a fall where was herve de lanrivain at this time he was standing outside in the court i just made him out in the darkness i told him for god's sake to go and then i pushed the door shut what did you do next i stood at the foot of the stairs and listened what did you hear i heard dogs snarling and panting visible discouragement of the bench boredom of the public and exasperation of the lawyer for the defense dogs again but the inquisitive judge insisted what dogs she bent her head and spoke so low that she had to be told to repeat her answer i don't know how do you mean you don't know i don't know what dogs the judge again intervened try to tell us exactly what happened how long did you remain at the foot of the stairs only a few minutes and what was going on meanwhile overhead the dogs kept on snarling and panting once or twice he cried out i think he moaned once then he was quiet then what happened then i heard a sound like the noise of a pack when the wolf is thrown to them gulping and lapping there was a groan of disgust and repulsion through the court and another attempted intervention by the distracted lawyer but the inquisitive judge was still inquisitive and all the while you did not go up yes i went up then to drive them off the dogs yes well when i got there it was quite dark i found my husband's flint and steel and struck a spark i saw him lying there he was dead and the dogs the dogs were gone gone where to i don't know there was no way out and there were no dogs at kerfol she straightened herself to her full height threw her arms above her head and fell down on the stone floor with a long scream there was a moment of confusion in the court room some one on the bench was heard to say this is clearly a case for the ecclesiastical authorities and the prisoner's lawyer doubtless jumped at the suggestion after this the trial loses itself in a maze of cross questioning and squabbling every witness who was called corroborated anne de cornault's statement that there were no dogs at kerfol had been none for several months the master of the house had taken a dislike to dogs there was no denying it but on the other hand at the inquest there had been long and bitter discussion as to the nature of the dead man's wounds one of the surgeons called in had spoken of marks that looked like bites the suggestion of witchcraft was revived and the opposing lawyers hurled tomes of necromancy at each other at last anne de cornault was brought back into court at the instance of the same judge and asked if she knew where the dogs she spoke of could have come from on the body of her redeemer she swore that she did not then the judge put his final question if the dogs you think you heard had been known to you do you think you would have recognized them by their barking yes did you recognize them yes what dogs do you take them to have been my dead dogs she said in a whisper she was taken out of court not to reappear there again there was some kind of ecclesiastical investigation and the end of the business was that the judges disagreed with each other and with the ecclesiastical committee and that anne de cornault was finally handed over to the keeping of her husband's family who shut her up in the keep of kerfol where she is said to have died many years later a harmless madwoman so ends her story as for that of herve de lanrivain i had only to apply to his collateral descendant for its subsequent details the evidence against the young man being insufficient and his family influence in the duchy considerable he was set free and left soon afterward for paris he was probably in no mood for a worldly life and he appears to have come almost immediately under the influence of the famous m arnauld d'andilly and the gentlemen of port royal a year or two later he was received into their order and without achieving any particular distinction he followed its good and evil fortunes till his death some twenty years later lanrivain showed me a portrait of him by a pupil of philippe de champaigne sad eyes an impulsive mouth and a narrow brow poor herve de lanrivain it was a grey ending yet as i looked at his stiff and sallow effigy in the dark dress of the jansenists i almost found myself envying his fate after all in the course of his life two great things had happened to him he had loved romantically and he must have talked with pascal the end mrs manstey's view as first published in scribner's magazine july 1891 the view from mrs manstey's window was not a striking one but to her at least it was full of interest and beauty mrs manstey occupied the back room on the third floor of a new york boarding house in a street where the ash barrels lingered late on the sidewalk and the gaps in the pavement would have staggered a quintus curtius she was the widow of a clerk in a large wholesale house and his death had left her alone for her only daughter had married in california and could not afford the long journey to new york to see her mother mrs manstey perhaps might have joined her daughter in the west but they had now been so many years apart that they had ceased to feel any need of each other's society and their intercourse had long been limited to the exchange of a few perfunctory letters written with indifference by the daughter and with difficulty by mrs manstey whose right hand was growing stiff with gout even had she felt a stronger desire for her daughter's companionship mrs manstey's increasing infirmity which caused her to dread the three flights of stairs between her room and the street would have given her pause on the eve of undertaking so long a journey and without perhaps formulating these reasons she had long since accepted as a matter of course her solitary life in new york she was indeed not quite lonely for a few friends still toiled up now and then to her room but their visits grew rare as the years went by mrs manstey had never been a sociable woman and during her husband's lifetime his companionship had been all sufficient to her for many years she had cherished a desire to live in the country to have a hen house and a garden but this longing had faded with age leaving only in the breast of the uncommunicative old woman a vague tenderness for plants and animals it was perhaps this tenderness which made her cling so fervently to her view from her window a view in which the most optimistic eye would at first have failed to discover anything admirable mrs manstey from her coign of vantage a slightly projecting bow window where she nursed an ivy and a succession of unwholesome looking bulbs looked out first upon the yard of her own dwelling of which however she could get but a restricted glimpse still her gaze took in the topmost boughs of the ailanthus below her window and she knew how early each year the clump of dicentra strung its bending stalk with hearts of pink but of greater interest were the yards beyond being for the most part attached to boarding houses they were in a state of chronic untidiness and fluttering on certain days of the week with miscellaneous garments and frayed table cloths in spite of this mrs manstey found much to admire in the long vista which she commanded some of the yards were indeed but stony"
