"1" "that the new armour had well acquitted itself in the severe trial to which it had been subjected some of the air buffers had been disabled probably on account of faults in their construction but these could readily be replaced and no further injury had been done the vessel it was not necessary therefore to continue the experiment any longer and besides there was danger that the englishman perceiving that his antagonist did not appear to be affected by his fire would approach closer and endeavour to ram her this was to be avoided for the scarabaeus was a much larger vessel than repeller no 1 and able to run into the latter and sink her by mere preponderance of weight it was therefore decided to now test the powers of the crabs signals were made from repeller no 1 to crab a which had been lying with the larger vessel between it and the enemy these signals were made by jets of dense black smoke which were ejected from a small pipe on the repeller these slender columns of smoke preserved their cylindrical forms for some moments and were visible at a great distance by day or night being illumined in the latter case by electric light the length and frequency of these jets were regulated by an instrument in the director's room thus by means of long and short puffs with the proper use of intervals a message could be projected into the air as a telegraphic instrument would mark it upon paper in this manner crab a was ordered to immediately proceed to the attack of the scarabaeus the almost submerged vessel steamed rapidly from behind her consort and made for the british man of war when the latter vessel perceived the approach of this turtle backed object squirting little jets of black smoke as she replied to the orders from the repeller there was great amazement on board the crab had not been seen before but as it came rapidly on there was no time for curiosity or discussion and several heavy guns were brought to bear upon it it was difficult to hit a rapidly moving flat object scarcely above the surface of the water and although several shot struck the crab they glanced off without in the least interfering with its progress crab a soon came so near the scarabaeus that it was impossible to depress the guns of the latter so as to strike her the great vessel was therefore headed toward its assailant and under a full head of steam dashed directly at it to run it down but the crab could turn as upon a pivot and shooting to one side allowed the surging man of war to pass it perceiving instantly that it would be difficult to strike this nimble and almost submerged adversary the commander of the scarabaeus thought it well to let it alone for the present and to bear down with all speed upon the repeller but it was easier to hit the crab than to leave it behind it was capable of great speed and following the british vessel it quickly came up with her the course of the scarabaeus was instantly changed and every effort was made to get the vessel into a position to run down the crab but this was not easy for so large a ship and crab a seemed to have no difficulty in keeping close to her stern several machine guns especially adopted for firing at torpedo boats or any hostile craft which might be discovered close to a vessel were now brought to bear upon the crab and ball after ball was hurled at her some of these struck but glanced off without penetrating her tough armour these manoeuvres had not continued long when the crew of the crab was ready to bring into action the peculiar apparatus of that peculiar craft an enormous pair of iron forceps each massive limb of which measured twelve feet or more in length was run out in front of the crab at a depth of six or eight feet below the surface these forceps were acted upon by an electric engine of immense power by which they could be shut opened projected withdrawn or turned and twisted the crab darted forward and in the next instant the great teeth of her pincers were fastened with a tremendous grip upon the rudder and rudder post of the scarabaeus then followed a sudden twist which sent a thrill through both vessels a crash a backward jerk the snapping of a chain and in a moment the great rudder with half of the rudder post attached was torn from the vessel and as the forceps opened it dropped to leeward and hung dangling by one chain again the forceps opened wide again there was a rush and this time the huge jaws closed upon the rapidly revolving screw propeller there was a tremendous crash and the small but massive crab turned over so far that for an instant one of its sides was plainly visible above the water the blades of the propeller were crushed and shivered those parts of the steamer's engines connecting with the propeller shaft were snapped and rent apart while the propeller shaft itself was broken by the violent stoppage the crab which had quickly righted now backed still holding the crushed propeller in its iron grasp and as it moved away from the scarabaeus it extracted about forty feet of its propeller shaft then opening its massive jaws it allowed the useless mass of iron to drop to the bottom of the sea every man on board the scarabaeus was wild with amazement and excitement few could comprehend what had happened but this very quickly became evident so far as motive power was concerned the scarabaeus was totally disabled she could not direct her course for her rudder was gone her propeller was gone her engines were useless and she could do no more than float as wind or tide might move her moreover there was a jagged hole in her stern where the shaft had been and through this the water was pouring into the vessel as a man of war the scarabaeus was worthless orders now came fast from repeller no 1 which had moved nearer to the scene of conflict it was to be supposed that the disabled ship was properly furnished with bulk heads so that the water would penetrate no farther than the stern compartment and that therefore she was in no danger of sinking crab a was ordered to make fast to the bow of the scarabaeus and tow her toward two men of war who were rapidly approaching from the harbour this proceeding astonished the commander and officers of the scarabaeus almost as much as the extraordinary attack which had been made upon their ship they had expected a demand to surrender and haul down their flag but the director in chief on board repeller no 1 was of the opinion that with her propeller extracted it mattered little what flag she flew his work with the scarabaeus was over for it had been ordered by the syndicate that its vessels should not encumber themselves with prizes towed by the powerful crab which apparently had no fear that its disabled adversary might fire upon it the scarabaeus moved toward the harbour and when it had come within a quarter of a mile of the foremost british vessel crab a cast off and steamed back to repeller no 1 the other english vessels soon came up and each lay to and sent a boat to the scarabaeus after half an hour's consultation in which the amazement of those on board the damaged vessel was communicated to the officers and crews of her two consorts it was determined that the smaller of these should tow the disabled ship into port while the other one in company with a man of war just coming out of the harbour should make an attack upon repeller no 1 it had been plainly proved that ordinary shot and shell had no effect upon this craft but it had not been proved that she could withstand the rams of powerful ironclads if this vessel that apparently carried no guns or at least had used none could be crushed capsized sunk or in any way put out of the fight it was probable that the dangerous submerged nautical machine would not care to remain in these waters if it remained it must be destroyed by torpedoes signals were exchanged between the two english vessels and in a very short time they were steaming toward the repeller it was a dangerous thing for two vessels of their size to come close enough together for both to ram an enemy at the same time but it was determined to take the risks and do this if possible for the destruction of the repeller was obviously the first duty in hand as the two men of war rapidly approached repeller no 1 they kept up a steady fire upon her for if in this way they could damage her the easier would be their task with a firm reliance upon the efficacy of the steel spring armour the director in chief felt no fear of the enemy's shot and shell but he was not at all willing that his vessel should be rammed for the consequences would probably be disastrous accordingly he did not wait for the approach of the two vessels but steering seaward he signalled for the other crab when crab b made its appearance puffing its little black jets of smoke as it answered the signals of the director in chief the commanders of the two british vessels were surprised they had imagined that there was only one of these strange and terrible enemies and had supposed that she would be afraid to make her peculiar attack upon one of them because while doing so she would expose herself to the danger of being run down by the other but the presence of two of these almost submerged engines of destruction entirely changed the situation but the commanders of the british ships were brave men they had started to run down the strangely armoured american craft and run her down they would if they could they put on more steam and went ahead at greater speed in such a furious onslaught the crabs might not dare to attack them but they did not understand the nature nor the powers of these enemies in less than twenty minutes crab a had laid hold of one of the men of war and crab b of the other the rudders of both were shattered and torn away and while the blades of one propeller were crushed to pieces the other with nearly half its shaft was drawn out and dropped into the ocean helplessly the two men of war rose and fell upon the waves in obedience to orders from the repeller each crab took hold of one of the disabled vessels and towed it near the mouth of the harbour where it was left the city was now in a state of feverish excitement which was intensified by the fact that a majority of the people did not understand what had happened while those to whom this had been made plain could not comprehend why such a thing should have been allowed to happen three of her majesty's ships of war equipped and ready for action had sailed out of the harbour and an apparently insignificant enemy without firing a gun had put them into such a condition that they were utterly unfit for service and must be towed into a dry dock how could the government the municipality the army or the navy explain this the anxiety the excitement the nervous desire to know what had happened and what might be expected next spread that evening to every part of the dominion reached by telegraph the military authorities in charge of the defences of the city were as much disturbed and amazed by what had happened as any civilian could possibly be but they had no fears for the safety of the place for the enemy's vessels could not possibly enter nor even approach the harbour the fortifications on the heights mounted guns much heavier than those on the men of war and shots from these fired from an elevation might sink even those underwater devils but more than on the forts they relied upon their admirable system of torpedoes and submarine batteries with these in position and ready for action as they now were it was impossible for an enemy's vessel floating on the water or under it to enter the harbour without certain destruction bulletins to this effect were posted in the city and somewhat allayed the popular anxiety although many people who were fearful of what might happen next left by the evening trains for the interior that night the news of this extraordinary affair was cabled to europe and thence back to the united states and all over the world in many quarters the account was disbelieved and in no quarter was it thoroughly understood for it must be borne in mind that the methods of operation employed by the crabs were not evident to those on board the disabled vessels but everywhere there was the greatest desire to know what would be done next it was the general opinion that the two armoured vessels were merely tenders to the submerged machines which had done the mischief having fired no guns nor taken any active part in the combat there was every reason to believe that they were intended merely as bomb proof store ships for their formidable consorts as these submerged vessels could not attack a town nor reduce fortifications but could exercise their power only against vessels afloat it was plain enough to see that the object of the american syndicate was to blockade the port that they would be able to maintain the blockade when the full power of the british navy should be brought to bear upon them was generally doubted though it was conceded in the most wrathful circles that until the situation should be altered it would be unwise to risk valuable war vessels in encounters with the diabolical sea monsters now lying off the port in the new york office of the syndicate there was great satisfaction the news received was incorrect and imperfect but it was evident that so far everything had gone well about nine o'clock the next morning repeller no 1 with her consort half a mile astern and preceded by the two crabs one on either bow approached to within two miles of the harbour mouth the crabs a quarter of a mile ahead of the repeller moved slowly for between them they bore an immense net three or four hundred feet long and thirty feet deep composed of jointed steel rods along the upper edge of this net was a series of air floats which were so graduated that they were sunk by the weight of the net a few feet below the surface of the water from which position they held the net suspended vertically this net which was intended to protect the repeller against the approach of submarine torpedoes which might be directed from the shore was anchored at each end two very small buoys indicating its position the crabs then falling astern repeller no 1 lay to with the sunken net between her and the shore and prepared to project the first instantaneous motor bomb ever used in warfare the great gun in the bow of the vessel was loaded with one of the largest and most powerful motor bombs and the spot to be aimed at was selected this was a point in the water just inside of the mouth of the harbour and nearly a mile from the land on either side the distance of this point from the vessel being calculated the cannon was adjusted at the angle called for by the scale of distances and levels and the instrument indicating rise fall and direction was then put in connection with it now the director in chief stepped forward to the button by pressing which the power of the motor was developed the chief of the scientific corps then showed him the exact point upon the scale which would be indicated when the gun was in its proper position and the piece was then moved upon its bearings so as to approximate as nearly as possible this direction the bow of the vessel now rose upon the swell of the sea and the instant that the index upon the scale reached the desired point the director in chief touched the button there was no report no smoke no visible sign that the motor had left the cannon but at that instant there appeared to those who were on the lookout from a fort about a mile away a vast aperture in the waters of the bay which was variously described as from one hundred yards to five hundred yards in diameter at that same instant in the neighbouring headlands and islands far up the shores of the bay and in every street and building of the city there was felt a sharp shock as if the underlying rocks had been struck by a gigantic trip hammer at the same instant the sky above the spot where the motor had descended was darkened by a wide spreading cloud this was formed of that portion of the water of the bay which had been instantaneously raised to the height of about a thousand feet the sudden appearance of this cloud was even more terrible than the yawning chasm in the waters of the bay or the startling shock but it did not remain long in view it had no sooner reached its highest elevation than it began to descend there was a strong sea breeze blowing and in its descent this vast mass of water was impelled toward the land it came down not as rain but as the waters of a vast cataract as though a mountain lake by an earthquake shock had been precipitated in a body upon a valley only one edge of it reached the land and here the seething flood tore away earth trees and rocks leaving behind it great chasms and gullies as it descended to the sea the bay itself into which the vast body of the water fell became a scene of surging madness the towering walls of water which had stood up all around the suddenly created aperture hurled themselves back into the abyss and down into the great chasm at the bottom of the bay which had been made when the motor sent its shock along the great rock beds down upon and into this roaring boiling tumult fell the tremendous cataract from above and the harbour became one wild expanse of leaping maddened waves hissing their whirling spray high into the air during these few terrific moments other things happened which passed unnoticed in the general consternation all along the shores of the bay and in front of the city the waters seemed to be sucked away slowly returning as the sea forced them to their level and at many points up and down the harbour there were submarine detonations and upheavals of the water these were caused by the explosion by concussion of every torpedo and submarine battery in the harbour and it was with this object in view that the instantaneous motor bomb had been shot into the mouth of the bay the effects of the discharge of the motor bomb astonished and even startled those on board the repellers and the crabs at the instant of touching the button a hydraulic shock was felt on repeller no 1 this was supposed to be occasioned the discharge of the motor but it was also felt on the other vessels it was the same shock that had been felt on shore but less in degree a few moments after there was a great heaving swell of the sea which tossed and rolled the four vessels and lifted the steel protecting net so high that for an instant parts of it showed themselves above the surface like glistening sea ghosts experiments with motor bombs had been made in unsettled mountainous districts but this was the first one which had ever exerted its power under water on shore in the forts and in the city no one for an instant supposed that the terrific phenomenon which had just occurred was in any way due to the vessels of the syndicate the repellers were in plain view and it was evident that neither of them had fired a gun besides the firing of cannon did not produce such effects it was the general opinion that there had been an earthquake shock accompanied by a cloud burst and extraordinary convulsions of the sea such a combination of elementary disturbances had never been known in these parts and a great many persons were much more frightened than if they had understood what had really happened in about half an hour after the discharge of the motor bomb when the sea had resumed its usual quiet a boat carrying a white flag left repeller no 1 rowed directly over the submerged net and made for the harbour when the approach of this flag of truce was perceived from the fort nearest the mouth of the harbour it occasioned much surmise had the earthquake brought these syndicate knaves to their senses or were they about to make further absurd and outrageous demands some irate officers were of the opinion that enemies like these should be considered no better than pirates and that their flag of truce should be fired upon but the commandant of the fort paid no attention to such counsels and sent a detachment with a white flag down to the beach to meet the approaching boat and learn its errand the men in the boat had nothing to do but to deliver a letter from the director in chief to the commandant of the fort and then row back again no answer was required when the commandant read the brief note he made no remark in fact he could think of no appropriate remark to make the missive simply informed him that at ten o'clock and eighteen minutes a m of that day the first bomb from the marine forces of the syndicate had been discharged into the waters of the harbour at or about two o'clock p.m the second bomb would be discharged at fort pilcher that was all what this extraordinary message meant could not be imagined by any officer of the garrison if the people on board the ships were taking advantage of the earthquake and supposed that they could induce british soldiers to believe that it had been caused by one of their bombs then were they idiots indeed they would fire their second shot at fort pilcher this was impossible for they had not yet fired their first shot these syndicate people were evidently very tricky and the defenders of the port must therefore be very cautious fort pilcher was a very large and unfinished fortification on a bluff on the opposite side of the harbour work had been discontinued on it as soon as the syndicate's vessels had appeared off the port for it was not desired to expose the builders and workmen to a possible bombardment the place was now therefore almost deserted but after the receipt of the syndicate's message the commandant feared that the enemy might throw an ordinary shell into the unfinished works and he sent a boat across the bay to order away any workmen or others who might be lingering about the place a little after two o'clock p.m an instantaneous motor bomb was discharged from repeller no 1 into fort pilcher it was set to act five seconds after impact with the object aimed at it struck in a central portion of the unfinished fort and having described a high curve in the air descended not only with its own motive power but with the force of gravitation and penetrated deep into the earth five seconds later a vast brown cloud appeared on the fort pilcher promontory this cloud was nearly spherical in form with an apparent diameter of about a thousand yards at the same instant a shock similar to that accompanying the first motor bomb was felt in the city and surrounding country but this was not so severe as the other for the second bomb did not exert its force upon the underlying rocks of the region as the first one had done the great brown cloud quickly began to lose its spherical form part of it descending heavily to the earth and part floating away in vast dust clouds borne inland by the breeze settling downward as they moved and depositing on land water ships houses domes and trees an almost impalpable powder when the cloud had cleared away there were no fortifications and the bluff on which they had stood had disappeared part of this bluff had floated away on the wind and part of it lay piled in great heaps of sand on the spot where its rocks were to have upheld a fort the effect of the motor bomb was fully observed with glasses from the various fortifications of the port and from many points of the city and harbour and those familiar with the effects of explosives were not long in making up their minds what had happened they felt sure that a mine had been sprung beneath fort pilcher and they were now equally confident that in the morning a torpedo of novel and terrible power had been exploded in the harbour they now disbelieved in the earthquake and treated with contempt the pretence that shots had been fired from the syndicate's vessel this was merely a trick of the enemy it was not even likely that the mine or the torpedo had been operated from the ship these were in all probability under the control of confederates on shore and had been exploded at times agreed upon beforehand all this was perfectly plain to the military authorities but the people of the city derived no comfort from the announcement of these conclusions for all that anybody knew the whole city might be undermined and at any moment might ascend in a cloud of minute particles they felt that they were in a region of hidden traitors and bombs and in consequence of this belief thousands of citizens left their homes that afternoon a truce boat again went out from repeller no 1 and rowed to the fort where a letter to the commandant was delivered this like the other demanded no answer and the boat returned later in the afternoon the two repellers accompanied by the crabs and leaving the steel net still anchored in its place retired a few miles seaward where they prepared to lay to for the night the letter brought by the truce boat was read by the commandant surrounded by his officers it stated that in twenty four hours from time of writing it which would be at or about four o'clock on the next afternoon a bomb would be thrown into the garrisoned fort under the command of the officer addressed as this would result in the entire destruction of the fortification the commandant was earnestly counselled to evacuate the fort before the hour specified ordinarily the commandant of the fort was of a calm and unexcitable temperament during the astounding events of that day and the day before he had kept his head cool his judgment if not correct was the result of sober and earnest consideration but now he lost his temper the unparalleled effrontery and impertinence of this demand of the american syndicate was too much for his self possession he stormed in anger here was the culmination of the knavish trickery of these conscienceless pirates who had attacked the port a torpedo had been exploded in the harbour an unfinished fort had been mined and blown up and all this had been done to frighten him a british soldier in command of a strong fort well garrisoned and fully supplied with all the munitions of war in the fear that his fort would be destroyed by a mystical bomb he was expected to march to a place of safety with all his forces if this should be done it would not be long before these crafty fellows would occupy the fort and with its great guns turned inland would hold the city at their mercy there could be no greater insult to a soldier than to suppose that he could be gulled by a trick like this no thought of actual danger entered the mind of the commandant it had been easy enough to sink a great torpedo in the harbour and the unguarded bluffs of fort pilcher offered every opportunity to the scoundrels who may have worked at their mines through the nights of several months but a mine under the fort which he commanded was an impossibility its guarded outposts prevented any such method of attack at a bomb or a dozen or a hundred of the syndicate's bombs he snapped his fingers he could throw bombs as well nothing would please him better than that those ark like ships in the offing should come near enough for an artillery fight a few tons of solid shot and shell dropped on top of them might be a very conclusive answer to their impudent demands the letter from the syndicate together"
