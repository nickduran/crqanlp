"1" "for fodder keep turning the land and always put up more hay than you need don't grudge your mother a little time for plowing her garden and setting out fruit trees even if it comes in a busy season she has been a good mother to you and she has always missed the old country when they went back to the kitchen the boys sat down silently at the table throughout the meal they looked down at their plates and did not lift their red eyes they did not eat much although they had been working in the cold all day and there was a rabbit stewed in gravy for supper and prune pies john bergson had married beneath him but he had married a good housewife mrs bergson was a fair skinned corpulent woman heavy and placid like her son oscar but there was something comfortable about her perhaps it was her own love of comfort for eleven years she had worthily striven to maintain some semblance of household order amid conditions that made order very difficult habit was very strong with mrs bergson and her unremitting efforts to repeat the routine of her old life among new surroundings had done a great deal to keep the family from disintegrating morally and getting careless in their ways the bergsons had a log house for instance only because mrs bergson would not live in a sod house she missed the fish diet of her own country and twice every summer she sent the boys to the river twenty miles to the southward to fish for channel cat when the children were little she used to load them all into the wagon the baby in its crib and go fishing herself alexandra often said that if her mother were cast upon a desert island she would thank god for her deliverance make a garden and find something to preserve preserving was almost a mania with mrs bergson stout as she was she roamed the scrubby banks of norway creek looking for fox grapes and goose plums like a wild creature in search of prey she made a yellow jam of the insipid ground cherries that grew on the prairie flavoring it with lemon peel and she made a sticky dark conserve of garden tomatoes she had experimented even with the rank buffalo pea and she could not see a fine bronze cluster of them without shaking her head and murmuring what a pity when there was nothing more to preserve she began to pickle the amount of sugar she used in these processes was sometimes a serious drain upon the family resources she was a good mother but she was glad when her children were old enough not to be in her way in the kitchen she had never quite forgiven john bergson for bringing her to the end of the earth but now that she was there she wanted to be let alone to reconstruct her old life in so far as that was possible she could still take some comfort in the world if she had bacon in the cave glass jars on the shelves and sheets in the press she disapproved of all her neighbors because of their slovenly housekeeping and the women thought her very proud once when mrs bergson on her way to norway creek stopped to see old mrs lee the old woman hid in the haymow for fear mis bergson would catch her barefoot iii one sunday afternoon in july six months after john bergson's death carl was sitting in the doorway of the linstrum kitchen dreaming over an illustrated paper when he heard the rattle of a wagon along the hill road looking up he recognized the bergsons team with two seats in the wagon which meant they were off for a pleasure excursion oscar and lou on the front seat wore their cloth hats and coats never worn except on sundays and emil on the second seat with alexandra sat proudly in his new trousers made from a pair of his father's and a pink striped shirt with a wide ruffled collar oscar stopped the horses and waved to carl who caught up his hat and ran through the melon patch to join them want to go with us lou called we're going to crazy ivar's to buy a hammock sure carl ran up panting and clambering over the wheel sat down beside emil i've always wanted to see ivar's pond they say it's the biggest in all the country aren't you afraid to go to ivar's in that new shirt emil he might want it and take it right off your back emil grinned i'd be awful scared to go he admitted if you big boys weren't along to take care of me did you ever hear him howl carl people say sometimes he runs about the country howling at night because he is afraid the lord will destroy him mother thinks he must have done something awful wicked lou looked back and winked at carl what would you do emil if you was out on the prairie by yourself and seen him coming emil stared maybe i could hide in a badger hole he suggested doubtfully but suppose there wasn't any badger hole lou persisted would you run no i'd be too scared to run emil admitted mournfully twisting his fingers i guess i'd sit right down on the ground and say my prayers the big boys laughed and oscar brandished his whip over the broad backs of the horses he wouldn't hurt you emil said carl persuasively he came to doctor our mare when she ate green corn and swelled up most as big as the water tank he petted her just like you do your cats i couldn't understand much he said for he don't talk any english but he kept patting her and groaning as if he had the pain himself and saying there now sister that's easier that's better lou and oscar laughed and emil giggled delightedly and looked up at his sister i don't think he knows anything at all about doctoring said oscar scornfully they say when horses have distemper he takes the medicine himself and then prays over the horses alexandra spoke up that's what the crows said but he cured their horses all the same some days his mind is cloudy like but if you can get him on a clear day you can learn a great deal from him he understands animals didn't i see him take the horn off the berquist's cow when she had torn it loose and went crazy she was tearing all over the place knocking herself against things and at last she ran out on the roof of the old dugout and her legs went through and there she stuck bellowing ivar came running with his white bag and the moment he got to her she was quiet and let him saw her horn off and daub the place with tar emil had been watching his sister his face reflecting the sufferings of the cow and then didn't it hurt her any more he asked alexandra patted him no not any more and in two days they could use her milk again the road to ivar's homestead was a very poor one he had settled in the rough country across the county line where no one lived but some russians half a dozen families who dwelt together in one long house divided off like barracks ivar had explained his choice by saying that the fewer neighbors he had the fewer temptations nevertheless when one considered that his chief business was horse doctoring it seemed rather short sighted of him to live in the most inaccessible place he could find the bergson wagon lurched along over the rough hummocks and grass banks followed the bottom of winding draws or skirted the margin of wide lagoons where the golden coreopsis grew up out of the clear water and the wild ducks rose with a whirr of wings lou looked after them helplessly i wish i'd brought my gun anyway alexandra he said fretfully i could have hidden it under the straw in the bottom of the wagon then we'd have had to lie to ivar besides they say he can smell dead birds and if he knew we wouldn't get anything out of him not even a hammock i want to talk to him and he won't talk sense if he's angry it makes him foolish lou sniffed whoever heard of him talking sense anyhow i'd rather have ducks for supper than crazy ivar's tongue emil was alarmed oh but lou you don't want to make him mad he might howl they all laughed again and oscar urged the horses up the crumbling side of a clay bank they had left the lagoons and the red grass behind them in crazy ivar's country the grass was short and gray the draws deeper than they were in the bergsons neighborhood and the land was all broken up into hillocks and clay ridges the wild flowers disappeared and only in the bottom of the draws and gullies grew a few of the very toughest and hardiest shoestring and ironweed and snow on the mountain look look emil there's ivar's big pond alexandra pointed to a shining sheet of water that lay at the bottom of a shallow draw at one end of the pond was an earthen dam planted with green willow bushes and above it a door and a single window were set into the hillside you would not have seen them at all but for the reflection of the sunlight upon the four panes of window glass and that was all you saw not a shed not a corral not a well not even a path broken in the curly grass but for the piece of rusty stovepipe sticking up through the sod you could have walked over the roof of ivar's dwelling without dreaming that you were near a human habitation ivar had lived for three years in the clay bank without defiling the face of nature any more than the coyote that had lived there before him had done when the bergsons drove over the hill ivar was sitting in the doorway of his house reading the norwegian bible he was a queerly shaped old man with a thick powerful body set on short bow legs his shaggy white hair falling in a thick mane about his ruddy cheeks made him look older than he was he was barefoot but he wore a clean shirt of unbleached cotton open at the neck he always put on a clean shirt when sunday morning came round though he never went to church he had a peculiar religion of his own and could not get on with any of the denominations often he did not see anybody from one week's end to another he kept a calendar and every morning he checked off a day so that he was never in any doubt as to which day of the week it was ivar hired himself out in threshing and corn husking time and he doctored sick animals when he was sent for when he was at home he made hammocks out of twine and committed chapters of the bible to memory ivar found contentment in the solitude he had sought out for himself he disliked the litter of human dwellings the broken food the bits of broken china the old wash boilers and tea kettles thrown into the sunflower patch he preferred the cleanness and tidiness of the wild sod he always said that the badgers had cleaner houses than people and that when he took a housekeeper her name would be mrs badger he best expressed his preference for his wild homestead by saying that his bible seemed truer to him there if one stood in the doorway of his cave and looked off at the rough land the smiling sky the curly grass white in the hot sunlight if one listened to the rapturous song of the lark the drumming of the quail the burr of the locust against that vast silence one understood what ivar meant on this sunday afternoon his face shone with happiness he closed the book on his knee keeping the place with his horny finger and repeated softly he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her house the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies before he opened his bible again ivar heard the bergsons wagon approaching and he sprang up and ran toward it no guns no guns he shouted waving his arms distractedly no ivar no guns alexandra called reassuringly he dropped his arms and went up to the wagon smiling amiably and looking at them out of his pale blue eyes we want to buy a hammock if you have one alexandra explained and my little brother here wants to see your big pond where so many birds come ivar smiled foolishly and began rubbing the horses noses and feeling about their mouths behind the bits not many birds just now a few ducks this morning and some snipe come to drink but there was a crane last week she spent one night and came back the next evening i don't know why it is not her season of course many of them go over in the fall then the pond is full of strange voices every night alexandra translated for carl who looked thoughtful ask him alexandra if it is true that a sea gull came here once i have heard so she had some difficulty in making the old man understand he looked puzzled at first then smote his hands together as he remembered oh yes yes a big white bird with long wings and pink feet my what a voice she had she came in the afternoon and kept flying about the pond and screaming until dark she was in trouble of some sort but i could not understand her she was going over to the other ocean maybe and did not know how far it was she was afraid of never getting there she was more mournful than our birds here she cried in the night she saw the light from my window and darted up to it maybe she thought my house was a boat she was such a wild thing next morning when the sun rose i went out to take her food but she flew up into the sky and went on her way ivar ran his fingers through his thick hair i have many strange birds stop with me here they come from very far away and are great company i hope you boys never shoot wild birds lou and oscar grinned and ivar shook his bushy head yes i know boys are thoughtless but these wild things are god's birds he watches over them and counts them as we do our cattle christ says so in the new testament now ivar lou asked may we water our horses at your pond and give them some feed it's a bad road to your place yes yes it is the old man scrambled about and began to loose the tugs a bad road eh girls and the bay with a colt at home oscar brushed the old man aside we'll take care of the horses ivar you'll be finding some disease on them alexandra wants to see your hammocks ivar led alexandra and emil to his little cave house he had but one room neatly plastered and whitewashed and there was a wooden floor there was a kitchen stove a table covered with oilcloth two chairs a clock a calendar a few books on the window shelf nothing more but the place was as clean as a cupboard but where do you sleep ivar emil asked looking about ivar unslung a hammock from a hook on the wall in it was rolled a buffalo robe there my son a hammock is a good bed and in winter i wrap up in this skin where i go to work the beds are not half so easy as this by this time emil had lost all his timidity he thought a cave a very superior kind of house there was something pleasantly unusual about it and about ivar do the birds know you will be kind to them ivar is that why so many come he asked ivar sat down on the floor and tucked his feet under him see little brother they have come from a long way and they are very tired from up there where they are flying our country looks dark and flat they must have water to drink and to bathe in before they can go on with their journey they look this way and that and far below them they see something shining like a piece of glass set in the dark earth that is my pond they come to it and are not disturbed maybe i sprinkle a little corn they tell the other birds and next year more come this way they have their roads up there as we have down here emil rubbed his knees thoughtfully and is that true ivar about the head ducks falling back when they are tired and the hind ones taking their place yes the point of the wedge gets the worst of it they cut the wind they can only stand it there a little while half an hour maybe then they fall back and the wedge splits a little while the rear ones come up the middle to the front then it closes up and they fly on with a new edge they are always changing like that up in the air never any confusion just like soldiers who have been drilled alexandra had selected her hammock by the time the boys came up from the pond they would not come in but sat in the shade of the bank outside while alexandra and ivar talked about the birds and about his housekeeping and why he never ate meat fresh or salt alexandra was sitting on one of the wooden chairs her arms resting on the table ivar was sitting on the floor at her feet ivar she said suddenly beginning to trace the pattern on the oilcloth with her forefinger i came to day more because i wanted to talk to you than because i wanted to buy a hammock yes the old man scraped his bare feet on the plank floor we have a big bunch of hogs ivar i wouldn't sell in the spring when everybody advised me to and now so many people are losing their hogs that i am frightened what can be done ivar's little eyes began to shine they lost their vagueness you feed them swill and such stuff of course and sour milk oh yes and keep them in a stinking pen i tell you sister the hogs of this country are put upon they become unclean like the hogs in the bible if you kept your chickens like that what would happen you have a little sorghum patch maybe put a fence around it and turn the hogs in build a shed to give them shade a thatch on poles let the boys haul water to them in barrels clean water and plenty get them off the old stinking ground and do not let them go back there until winter give them only grain and clean feed such as you would give horses or cattle hogs do not like to be filthy the boys outside the door had been listening lou nudged his brother come the horses are done eating let's hitch up and get out of here he'll fill her full of notions she'll be for having the pigs sleep with us next oscar grunted and got up carl who could not understand what ivar said saw that the two boys were displeased they did not mind hard work but they hated experiments and could never see the use of taking pains even lou who was more elastic than his older brother disliked to do anything different from their neighbors he felt that it made them conspicuous and gave people a chance to talk about them once they were on the homeward road the boys forgot their ill humor and joked about ivar and his birds alexandra did not propose any reforms in the care of the pigs and they hoped she had forgotten ivar's talk they agreed that he was crazier than ever and would never be able to prove up on his land because he worked it so little alexandra privately resolved that she would have a talk with ivar about this and stir him up the boys persuaded carl to stay for supper and go swimming in the pasture pond after dark that evening after she had washed the supper dishes alexandra sat down on the kitchen doorstep while her mother was mixing the bread it was a still deep breathing summer night full of the smell of the hay fields sounds of laughter and splashing came up from the pasture and when the moon rose rapidly above the bare rim of the prairie the pond glittered like polished metal and she could see the flash of white bodies as the boys ran about the edge or jumped into the water alexandra watched the shimmering pool dreamily but eventually her eyes went back to the sorghum patch south of the barn where she was planning to make her new pig corral iv for the first three years after john bergson's death the affairs of his family prospered then came the hard times that brought every one on the divide to the brink of despair three years of drouth and failure the last struggle of a wild soil against the encroaching plowshare the first of these fruitless summers the bergson boys bore courageously the failure of the corn crop made labor cheap lou and oscar hired two men and put in bigger crops than ever before they lost everything they spent the whole country was discouraged farmers who were already in debt had to give up their land a few foreclosures demoralized the county the settlers sat about on the wooden sidewalks in the little town and told each other that the country was never meant for men to live in the thing to do was to get back to iowa to illinois to any place that had been proved habitable the bergson boys certainly would have been happier with their uncle otto in the bakery shop in chicago like most of their neighbors they were meant to follow in paths already marked out for them not to break trails in a new country a steady job a few holidays nothing to think about and they would have been very happy it was no fault of theirs that they had been dragged into the wilderness when they were little boys a pioneer should have imagination should be able to enjoy the idea of things more than the things themselves the second of these barren summers was passing one september afternoon alexandra had gone over to the garden across the draw to dig sweet potatoes they had been thriving upon the weather that was fatal to everything else but when carl linstrum came up the garden rows to find her she was not working she was standing lost in thought leaning upon her pitchfork her sunbonnet lying beside her on the ground the dry garden patch smelled of drying vines and was strewn with yellow seed cucumbers and pumpkins and citrons at one end next the rhubarb grew feathery asparagus with red berries down the middle of the garden was a row of gooseberry and currant bushes a few tough zenias and marigolds and a row of scarlet sage bore witness to the buckets of water that mrs bergson had carried there after sundown against the prohibition of her sons carl came quietly and slowly up the garden path looking intently at alexandra she did not hear him she was standing perfectly still with that serious ease so characteristic of her her thick reddish braids twisted about her head fairly burned in the sunlight the air was cool enough to make the warm sun pleasant on one's back and shoulders and so clear that the eye could follow a hawk up and up into the blazing blue depths of the sky even carl never a very cheerful boy and considerably darkened by these last two bitter years loved the country on days like this felt something strong and young and wild come out of it that laughed at care alexandra he said as he approached her i want to talk to you let's sit down by the gooseberry bushes he picked up her sack of potatoes and they crossed the garden boys gone to town he asked as he sank down on the warm sun baked earth well we have made up our minds at last alexandra we are really going away she looked at him as if she were a little frightened really carl is it settled yes father has heard from st louis and they will give him back his old job in the cigar factory he must be there by the first of november they are taking on new men then we will sell the place for whatever we can get and auction the stock we haven't enough to ship i am going to learn engraving with a german engraver there and then try to get work in chicago alexandra's hands dropped in her lap her eyes became dreamy and filled with tears carl's sensitive lower lip trembled he scratched in the soft earth beside him with a stick that's all i hate about it alexandra he said slowly you've stood by us through so much and helped father out so many times and now it seems as if we were running off and leaving you to face the worst of it but it isn't as if we could really ever be of any help to you we are only one more drag one more thing you look out for and feel responsible for father was never meant for a farmer you know that and i hate it we'd only get in deeper and deeper yes yes carl i know you are wasting your life here you are able to do much better things you are nearly nineteen now and i wouldn't have you stay i've always hoped you would get away but i can't help feeling scared when i think how i will miss you more than you will ever know she brushed the tears from her cheeks not trying to hide them but alexandra he said sadly and wistfully i've never been any real help to you beyond sometimes trying to keep the boys in a good humor alexandra smiled and shook her head oh it's not that nothing like that it's by understanding me and the boys and mother that you've helped me i expect that is the only way one person ever really can help another i think you are about the only one that ever helped me somehow it will take more courage to bear your going than everything that has happened before carl looked at the ground you see we've all depended so on you he said even father he makes me laugh when anything comes up he always says i wonder what the bergsons are going to do about that i guess i'll go and ask her i'll never forget that time when we first came here and our horse had the colic and i ran over to your place your father was away and you came home with me and showed father how to let the wind out of the horse you were only a little girl then but you knew ever so much more about farm work than poor father you remember how homesick i used to get and what long talks we used to have coming from school we've someway always felt alike about things yes that's it we've liked the same things and we've liked them together without anybody else knowing and we've had good times hunting for christmas trees and going for ducks and making our plum wine together every year we've never either of us had any other close friend and now alexandra wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron and now i must remember that you are going where you will have many friends and will find the work you were meant to do but you'll write to me carl that will mean a great deal to me here i'll write as long as i live cried the boy impetuously and i'll be working for you as much as for myself alexandra i want to do something you'll like and be proud of i'm a fool here but i know i can do something he sat up and frowned at the red grass alexandra sighed how discouraged the boys will be when they hear they always come home from town discouraged anyway so many people are trying to leave the country and they talk to our boys and make them low spirited i'm afraid they are beginning to feel hard toward me because i won't listen to any talk about"
