"1" "steadily in the face of his visitor i mean the poorhouse which the town generously provides for those who cannot support themselves this was the first intimation grace had received of the possibility that they would be sent to such a home and it frightened her oh frank she exclaimed must we go to the poorhouse no grace don't be frightened said frank soothingly we will not go frank fowler said the deacon sternly cease to mislead your sister i am not misleading her sir did you not tell her that she would not be obliged to go to the poorhouse yes sir then what do you mean by resisting my authority you have no authority over us we are not paupers and frank lifted his head proudly and looked steadily in the face of the deacon you are paupers whether you admit it or not we are not said the boy indignantly where is your money where is your property here sir said our hero holding out his hands i have two strong hands and they will help me make a living for my sister and myself may i ask whether you expect to live here and use my furniture i do not intend to sir i shall ask no favors of you neither for grace nor myself i am going to leave the house i only came back to get a few clothes mr pomeroy has invited grace and me to stay at his house for a few days i haven't decided what i shall do afterward you will have to go to the poorhouse then i have no objection to your making this visit first it will be a saving to the town then sir we will bid you good day grace let us go chapter v a little misunderstanding have you carried frank fowler to the poorhouse asked tom pinkerton eagerly on his father's return no said the deacon he is going to make a visit at mr pomeroy's first i shouldn't think you would have let him make a visit said tom discontentedly i should think you would have taken him to the poorhouse right off i feel it my duty to save the town unnecessary expense said deacon pinkerton so tom was compelled to rest satisfied with his father's assurance that the removal was only deferred meanwhile frank and grace received a cordial welcome at the house of mr pomeroy sam and frank were intimate friends and our hero had been in the habit of calling frequently and it seemed homelike i wish you could stay with us all the time frank you and grace said sam one evening we should all like it said mr pomeroy but we cannot always have what we want if i had it in my power to offer frank any employment which it would be worth his while to follow it might do but he has got his way to make in the world have you formed any plans yet frank that is what i want to consult you about mr pomeroy i will give you the best advice i can frank i suppose you do not mean to stay in the village no sir there is nothing for me to do here i must go somewhere where i can make a living for grace and myself you've got a hard row to hoe frank said mr pomeroy thoughtfully have you decided where to go yes sir i shall go to new york what to the city yes sir i'll get something to do no matter what it is but how are you going to live in the meantime i've got a little money that won't last long i know it but i shall soon get work if it is only to black boots in the streets with that spirit frank you will stand a fair chance to succeed what do you mean to do with grace i will take her with me i can think of a better plan leave her here till you have found something to do then send for her but if i leave her here deacon pinkerton will want to put her in the poorhouse i can't bear to have grace go there she need not she can stay here with me for three months will you let me pay her board i can afford to give her board for three months you are very kind mr pomeroy but it wouldn't be right for me to accept your kindness it is my duty to take care of grace i honor your independence frank it shall be as you say when you are able mind not till then you may pay me at the rate of two dollars a week for grace's board then said frank if you are willing to board grace for a while i think i had better go to the city at once i will look over your clothes to morrow frank said mrs pomeroy and see if they need mending then i will start thursday morning the day after about four o'clock the next afternoon he was walking up the main street when just in front of deacon pinkerton's house he saw tom leaning against a tree how are you tom he said and was about to pass on where are you going tom asked abruptly to mr pomeroy's how soon are you going to the poorhouse to live who told you i was going my father then your father's mistaken ain't you a pauper said tom insolently you haven't got any money i have got hands to earn money and i am going to try anyway i advise you to resign as captain of the baseball club why because if you don't you'll be kicked out do you think the fellows will be willing to have a pauper for their captain that's the second time you have called me a pauper don't call me so again you are a pauper and you know it frank was not a quarrelsome boy but this repeated insult was too much for him he seized tom by the collar and tripping him up left him on the ground howling with rage as valor was not his strong point he resolved to be revenged upon frank vicariously he was unable to report the case to his father till the next morning as the deacon did not return from a neighboring village whither he had gone on business till late but the result of his communication was a call at mr pomeroy's from the deacon at nine o'clock the next morning had he found frank it was his intention at tom's request to take him at once to the poorhouse but he was too late our hero was already on his way to new york chapter vi frank gets a place so this is new york said frank to himself as he emerged from the railway station and looked about him with interest and curiosity black yer boots shine asked a bootblack seeing our hero standing still frank looked at his shoes they were dirty without doubt but he would not have felt disposed to be so extravagant considering his limited resources had he not felt it necessary to obtain some information about the city yes he said you may black them the boy was on his knees instantly and at work how much do you make in a day asked frank when it's a good day i make a dollar that's pretty good said frank can you show me the way to broadway go straight ahead our hero paid for his shine and started in the direction indicated frank's plans so far as he had any were to get into a store he knew that broadway was the principal business street in the city and this was about all he did know about it he reached the great thoroughfare in a few minutes and was fortunate enough to find on the window of the corner store the sign a boy wanted he entered at once and going up to the counter addressed a young man who was putting up goods do you want a boy i believe the boss wants one i don't go out to that desk frank found the desk and propounded the same question to a sandy whiskered man who looked up from his writing you're prompt he said that notice was only put out two minutes ago i only saw it one minute ago so you want the place do you i should like it do you know your way about the city no sir but i could soon find out that won't do i shall have plenty of applications from boys who live in the city and are familiar with the streets frank left the store rather discomfited he soon came to another store where there was a similar notice of a boy wanted it was a dry goods store do you live with your parents was asked my parents are dead said frank sadly very sorry but we can't take you why not sir in case you took anything we should make your parents responsible i shouldn't take anything said frank indignantly you might i can't take you our hero left this store a little disheartened by his second rebuff he made several more fruitless applications but did not lose courage wholly he was gaining an appetite however it is not surprising therefore that his attention was drawn to the bills of a restaurant on the opposite side of the street he crossed over and standing outside began to examine them to see what was the scale of prices while in this position he was suddenly aroused by a slap on the back turning he met the gaze of a young man of about thirty who was smiling quite cordially why frank my boy how are you he said offering his hand pretty well thank you said our hero bewildered for he had no recollection of the man who had called him by name the other smiled a little more broadly and thought it was a lucky guess his name is frank i am delighted to hear it he continued when did you reach the city this morning said the unsuspecting frank well it's queer i happened to meet you so soon isn't it going to stay long i shall if i can get a place perhaps i can help you i suppose i ought to remember you ventured our hero but i can't think of your name jasper wheelock you don't mean to say you don't remember me perhaps it isn't strange as we only met once or twice in your country home but that doesn't matter i'm just as ready to help you by the way have you dined no no more have i come in and dine with me what'll you take asked jasper wheelock passing the bill of fare to frank i think i should like to have some roast beef said frank that will suit me here waiter two plates of roast beef and two cups of coffee how are they all at home asked jasper my mother has just died you don't say so said jasper sympathetically my sister is well i forgot your sister's name grace of course grace i find it hard to remember names the fact is i have been trying to recall your last name but it's gone from me fowler to be sure frank fowler how could i be so forgetful the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of the coffee and roast beet which both he and his new friend attacked with vigor what kind of pudding will you have asked the stranger apple dumpling said frank that suits me apple dumpling for two in due time the apple dumpling was disposed of and two checks were brought amounting to seventy cents i'll pay for both said jasper no thanks we are old acquaintances you know he put his hand into his pocket and quickly withdrew it with an exclamation of surprise well if that isn't a good joke he said i've left my money at home i remember now i left it in the pocket of my other coat i shall have to borrow the money of you you may as well hand me a dollar frank was not disposed to be suspicious but the request for money made him uneasy still there seemed no way of refusing and he reluctantly drew out the money his companion settled the bill and then led the way into the street jasper wheelock was not very scrupulous he was quite capable of borrowing money without intending to return it but he had his good side frank said he as they found themselves in the street you have done me a favor and i am going to help you in return have you got very much money no i had twenty dollars when i left home but i had to pay my fare in the cars and the dinner i have seventeen dollars and a half left then it is necessary for you to get a place as soon as possible yes i have a sister to support grace you know no i don't know the fact is frank i have been imposing upon you i never saw you before in the whole course of my life what made you say you knew me i wanted to get a dinner out of you don't be troubled though i'll pay back the money i've been out of a place for three or four weeks but i enter upon one the first of next week for the rest of the week i've got nothing to do and i will try to get you a place the first thing is to get a room somewhere i'll tell you what you may have part of my room is it expensive no i pay a dollar and a half a week i think the old lady won't charge more than fifty cents extra for you then my share would be a dollar you may pay only fifty cents i'll keep on paying what i do now my room is on sixth avenue they had some distance to walk finally jasper halted before a baker's shop it's over this he said he drew out a latch key and entered this is my den he said it isn't large you can't get any better for the money i shall have to be satisfied said frank i want to get along as cheap as i can i've got to economize myself for a short time after this week i shall earn fifteen dollars a week what business are you in mr wheelock i am a journeyman printer it is a very good business and i generally have steady work i expect to have after i get started again now shall i give you some advice i wish you would you don't know your way around new york i believe i have a map somewhere i'll just show you on it the position of the principal streets and that will give you a clearer idea of where we go the map was found and jasper explained to frank the leading topographical features of the island city one thing only was wanting now to make him contented and this was employment but it was too late to make any further inquiries i've been thinking frank said jasper the next morning that you might get the position as a cash boy what does a cash boy do in large retail establishments every salesman keeps a book in which his sales are entered he does not himself make change for it would not do to have so many having access to the money drawer the money is carried to the cashier's desk by boys employed for the purpose who return with the change do you think i can get a situation as cash boy i will try at gilbert mack's i know one of the principal salesmen if there is a vacancy he will get it for you to oblige me they entered a large retail store on broadway it was broad and spacious twenty salesmen stood behind the counter and boys were running this way and that with small books in their hands how are you duncan said jasper the person addressed was about jasper wheelock's age he had a keen energetic look and manner and would be readily singled out as one of the leading clerks all right wheelock how are you he responded do you want anything in our line no goods i want a place for this youngster he's a friend of mine i'll answer for his good character that will be satisfactory but what sort of a place does he want he is ready to begin as cash boy then we can oblige you as one of our boys has fallen sick and we have not supplied his place i'll speak to mr gilbert he went up to mr gilbert a portly man in the back part of the store mr gilbert seemed to be asking two or three questions frank waited the result in suspense dreading another disappointment but this time he was fortunate the boy can stay reported duncan his wages are three dollars a week it was not much but frank was well pleased to feel that at last he had a place in the city he wrote a letter to grace in the evening announcing his success and expressing the hope that he would soon be able to send for her chapter vii the cash boy has an adventure four weeks passed the duties of a cash boy are simple enough and frank had no difficulty in discharging them satisfactorily at first he found it tiresome being on his feet all day for the cash boys were not allowed to sit down but he got used to this being young and strong all this was very satisfactory but one thing gave frank uneasiness his income was very inadequate to his wants what makes you so glum frank asked jasper wheelock one evening do i look glum said frank i was only thinking how i could earn more money you know how little i get i can hardly take care of myself much less take care of grace i can lend you some money frank thanks to your good advice i have got some laid up thank you jasper but that wouldn't help matters i should owe you the money and i don't know how i could pay you about increasing your income i really don't know said jasper i am afraid gilbert mack wouldn't raise your wages i don't expect it all the rest of the cash boys would ask the same thing true still i know they are very well pleased with you duncan told me you did more work than any of the rest of the boys i try to do all i can he said you would make a good salesman he thought of course you are too young for that yet i suppose i am frank i am earning fifteen dollars a week you know and i can get along on ten but of the five i save let me give you two i shall never feel it and by and by when you are promoted it won't be necessary jasper you are a true friend said frank warmly but it wouldn't be right for me to accept your kind offer though i shan't forget it you have been a good friend to me and you to me frank i'll look out for you perhaps i may hear of something for you small as frank's income was he had managed to live within it it will be remembered that he had paid but fifty cents a week for a room by great economy he had made his meals cost but two dollars a week so that out of his three dollars he saved fifty cents but this saving would not be sufficient to pay for his clothes however he had had no occasion to buy any as yet and his little fund altogether amounted to twenty dollars of this sum he inclosed sic eight dollars to mr pomeroy to pay for four weeks board for grace i hope i shall be able to keep it up he said to himself thoughtfully at any rate i've got enough to pay for six weeks more before that time something may turn up several days passed without showing frank any way by which he could increase his income jasper again offered to give him two dollars a week out of his own wages but this our hero steadily refused one friday evening just as the store was about to close the head salesman called frank to him where do you live he asked in sixth avenue near twenty fifth street there's a bundle to go to forty sixth street i'll pay your fare upon the stage if you'll carry it i promised to send it to night and i don't like to disappoint the lady i can carry it just as well as not frank took the bundle and got on board a passing omnibus there was just one seat vacant beside an old gentleman of seventy who appeared to be quite feeble at forty fifth street he pulled the strap and prepared to descend leaning heavily on his cane as he did so by some mischance the horses started a little too soon and the old man losing his footing fell in the street frank observed the accident and sprang out instantly to his help i hope you are not much hurt sir he said hastily i have hurt my knee said the old gentleman let me assist you sir said frank helping him up thank you my boy i live at number forty five close by if you will lead me to the door and into the house i shall be much indebted to you certainly sir it is no trouble to me with slow step supported by our hero the old gentleman walked to his own door it was opened by a maid servant who looked with some surprise at frank i fell mary explained her master and this young gentleman has kindly helped me home did you hurt yourself much sir not seriously can i do anything more for you sir asked frank come in a moment our hero followed his new acquaintance into a handsomely furnished parlor now my young friend tell me if you have been taken out of your way by your attention to me oh no sir i intended to get out at the next street my dinner is just ready won't you stop and dine with me thank you sir he said hesitatingly but i promised to carry this bundle i believe it is wanted at once so you shall you say the house is in the next street you can go and return in five minutes you have done me a service and i may have it in my power to do something for you in return perhaps thought frank he can help me to some employment for my evenings then aloud thank you sir i will come five minutes later frank was ushered into a handsome dining room the dinner was already on the table but chairs were only set for three the one at the head of the table was of course occupied by the old gentleman the one opposite by mrs bradley his housekeeper and one at the side was placed for frank mrs bradley said the old gentleman this is a young gentleman who was kind enough to help me home after the accident of which i just spoke to you i would mention his name but i must leave that to him frank fowler sir and my name is wharton now that we are all introduced we can talk more freely will you have some soup mr fowler asked the housekeeper she was a tall thin woman with a reserved manner that was somewhat repellant she had only nodded slightly at the introduction fixing her eyes coldly and searchingly on the face of our hero it was evident that whatever impression the service rendered might have made upon the mind of mr wharton it was not calculated to warm the housekeeper to cordiality thank you he answered but he could not help feeling at the same time that mrs bradley was not a very agreeable woman you ought to have a good appetite said mr wharton you have to work hard during the day our young friend is a cash boy at gilbert mack's mrs bradley oh indeed said mrs bradley arching her brows as much as to say you have invited strange company to dinner do your parents live in the city frank i believe your name is frank no sir they are dead my mother died only a few weeks since and have you no brothers and sisters i have one sister grace i suppose she is in the city here with you no sir i left her in the country i am here alone i will ask you more about yourself after dinner if you have no engagement i should like to have you stay with me a part of the evening thank you sir frank accepted the invitation though he knew jasper would wonder what had become of him he saw that the old gentleman was kindly disposed toward him and in his present circumstances he needed such a friend but in proportion as mr wharton became more cordial mrs bradley became more frosty until at last the old gentleman noticed her manner don't you feel well this evening mrs bradley he asked i have a little headache said the housekeeper coldly you had better do something for it it will pass away of itself sir they arose from the dinner table and mr wharton followed by frank ascended the staircase to the front room on the second floor which was handsomely fitted up as a library what makes him take such notice of a mere cash boy said mrs bradley to herself that boy reminds me of somebody who is it chapter viii an unexpected engagement take a seat frank said mr wharton pointing to a luxurious armchair on one side of the cheerful grate fire i will take the other and you shall tell me all about yourself thank you sir said our hero his confidence was won by mr wharton's kind tone and he briefly recounted his story at the conclusion mr wharton said how old are you frank fourteen sir you are a brave boy and a good boy and you deserve success thank you sir but i am bound to say that you have a hard task before you i know it sir why not let your sister go to the poorhouse for a few years till you are older and better able to provide for her i should be ashamed to do it sir he said i promised my mother to take care of grace and i will how much do you earn as a cash boy three dollars a week only three dollars a week why that won't pay your own expenses said the old gentleman in surprise yes sir it does i pay fifty cents a week for my room and my meals don't cost me much but you will want clothes i have enough for the present and i am laying up fifty cents a week to buy more when i need them you can't buy many for twenty six dollars a year but that doesn't allow anything for your sister's expenses that is what puzzles me sir said frank fixing a troubled glance upon the fire i shall have to work in the evenings for grace what can you do i could copy but i suppose there isn't much chance of getting copying to do then you have a good handwriting pretty fair sir let me see a specimen there are pen and ink on the table and here is a sheet of paper frank seated himself at the table and wrote his name on the paper very good said his host approvingly your hand is good enough for a copyist but you are correct in supposing that work of that kind is hard to get are you a good reader do you mean in reading aloud sir yes i will try if you wish take a book from the table any book and let me hear you read frank opened the first book that came to hand one of irving's and read in a clear unembarrassed voice about half a page very good indeed said mr wharton you have been well taught where did you attend school only in the town school sir you have at any rate made good use of your advantages but will it do me any good sir asked frank people are not paid for reading are they not in general but we will suppose the case of a person whose eyes are weak and likely to be badly affected by evening use then suppose such a person could secure the services of a good clear distinct reader don't you think he would be willing to pay something i suppose so do you know of any such person asked frank i am describing myself frank a year since i strained my eyes very severely and have never dared to use them much since by gaslight mrs bradley my housekeeper has read to me some but she has other duties and i don't think she enjoys it very"
