"1" "london in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon by that time there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations the mildewy inside of the coach with its damp and dirty straw its disagreeable smell and its obscurity was rather like a larger dog kennel mr lorry the passenger shaking himself out of it in chains of straw a tangle of shaggy wrapper flapping hat and muddy legs was rather like a larger sort of dog there will be a packet to calais tomorrow drawer yes sir if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair the tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon sir bed sir i shall not go to bed till night but i want a bedroom and a barber and then breakfast sir yes sir that way sir if you please show concord gentleman's valise and hot water to concord pull off gentleman's boots in concord you will find a fine sea coal fire sir fetch barber to concord stir about there now for concord the concord bed chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the royal george that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it all kinds and varieties of men came out of it consequently another drawer and two porters and several maids and the landlady were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord and the coffee room when a gentleman of sixty formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes pretty well worn but very well kept with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets passed along on his way to his breakfast the coffee room had no other occupant that forenoon than the gentleman in brown his breakfast table was drawn before the fire and as he sat with its light shining on him waiting for the meal he sat so still that he might have been sitting for his portrait very orderly and methodical he looked with a hand on each knee and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist coat as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire he had a good leg and was a little vain of it for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close and were of a fine texture his shoes and buckles too though plain were trim he wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig setting very close to his head which wig it is to be presumed was made of hair but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass his linen though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea a face habitually suppressed and quieted was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner in years gone by some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of tellson's bank he had a healthy colour in his cheeks and his face though lined bore few traces of anxiety but perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in tellson's bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people and perhaps second hand cares like second hand clothes come easily off and on completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait mr lorry dropped off to sleep the arrival of his breakfast roused him and he said to the drawer as he moved his chair to it i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to day she may ask for mr jarvis lorry or she may only ask for a gentleman from tellson's bank please to let me know yes sir tellson's bank in london sir yes yes sir we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris sir a vast deal of travelling sir in tellson and company's house yes we are quite a french house as well as an english one yes sir not much in the habit of such travelling yourself i think sir not of late years it is fifteen years since we since i came last from france indeed sir that was before my time here sir before our people's time here sir the george was in other hands at that time sir i believe so but i would hold a pretty wager sir that a house like tellson and company was flourishing a matter of fifty not to speak of fifteen years ago you might treble that and say a hundred and fifty yet not be far from the truth indeed sir rounding his mouth and both his eyes as he stepped backward from the table the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left dropped into a comfortable attitude and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank as from an observatory or watchtower according to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages when mr lorry had finished his breakfast he went out for a stroll on the beach the little narrow crooked town of dover hid itself away from the beach and ran its head into the chalk cliffs like a marine ostrich the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about and the sea did what it liked and what it liked was destruction it thundered at the town and thundered at the cliffs and brought the coast down madly the air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea a little fishing was done in the port and a quantity of strolling about by night and looking seaward particularly at those times when the tide made and was near flood small tradesmen who did no business whatever sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter as the day declined into the afternoon and the air which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen became again charged with mist and vapour mr lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud too when it was dark and he sat before the coffee room fire awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast his mind was busily digging digging digging in the live red coals a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work mr lorry had been idle a long time and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street and rumbled into the inn yard he set down his glass untouched this is mam'selle said he in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss manette had arrived from london and would be happy to see the gentleman from tellson's so soon miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road and required none then and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from tellson's immediately if it suited his pleasure and convenience the gentleman from tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears and follow the waiter to miss manette's apartment it was a large dark room furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair and loaded with heavy dark tables these had been oiled and oiled until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf as if _they_ were buried in deep graves of black mahogany and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr lorry picking his way over the well worn turkey carpet supposed miss manette to be for the moment in some adjacent room until having got past the two tall candles he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire a young lady of not more than seventeen in a riding cloak and still holding her straw travelling hat by its ribbon in her hand as his eyes rested on a short slight pretty figure a quantity of golden hair a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look and a forehead with a singular capacity remembering how young and smooth it was of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity or wonder or alarm or merely of a bright fixed attention though it included all the four expressions as his eyes rested on these things a sudden vivid likeness passed before him of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very channel one cold time when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high the likeness passed away like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier glass behind her on the frame of which a hospital procession of negro cupids several headless and all cripples were offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender and he made his formal bow to miss manette pray take a seat sir in a very clear and pleasant young voice a little foreign in its accent but a very little indeed i kiss your hand miss said mr lorry with the manners of an earlier date as he made his formal bow again and took his seat i received a letter from the bank sir yesterday informing me that some intelligence or discovery the word is not material miss either word will do respecting the small property of my poor father whom i never saw so long dead mr lorry moved in his chair and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids as if _they_ had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets rendered it necessary that i should go to paris there to communicate with a gentleman of the bank so good as to be despatched to paris for the purpose myself as i was prepared to hear sir she curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those days with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she he made her another bow i replied to the bank sir that as it was considered necessary by those who know and who are so kind as to advise me that i should go to france and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place myself during the journey under that worthy gentleman's protection the gentleman had left london but i think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here i was happy said mr lorry to be entrusted with the charge i shall be more happy to execute it sir i thank you indeed i thank you very gratefully it was told me by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business and that i must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature i have done my best to prepare myself and i naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are naturally said mr lorry yes i after a pause he added again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears it is very difficult to begin he did not begin but in his indecision met her glance the young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression but it was pretty and characteristic besides being singular and she raised her hand as if with an involuntary action she caught at or stayed some passing shadow are you quite a stranger to me sir am i not mr lorry opened his hands and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing he watched her as she mused and the moment she raised her eyes again went on in your adopted country i presume i cannot do better than address you as a young english lady miss manette if you please sir miss manette i am a man of business i have a business charge to acquit myself of in your reception of it don't heed me any more than if i was a speaking machine truly i am not much else i will with your leave relate to you miss the story of one of our customers story he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated when he added in a hurry yes customers in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers he was a french gentleman a scientific gentleman a man of great acquirements a doctor not of beauvais why yes of beauvais like monsieur manette your father the gentleman was of beauvais like monsieur manette your father the gentleman was of repute in paris i had the honour of knowing him there our relations were business relations but confidential i was at that time in our french house and had been oh twenty years at that time i may ask at what time sir i speak miss of twenty years ago he married an english lady and i was one of the trustees his affairs like the affairs of many other french gentlemen and french families were entirely in tellson's hands in a similar way i am or i have been trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers these are mere business relations miss there is no friendship in them no particular interest nothing like sentiment i have passed from one to another in the course of my business life just as i pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day in short i have no feelings i am a mere machine to go on but this is my father's story sir and i begin to think the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him that when i was left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years it was you who brought me to england i am almost sure it was you mr lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his and he put it with some ceremony to his lips he then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again and holding the chair back with his left hand and using his right by turns to rub his chin pull his wig at the ears or point what he said stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his miss manette it _was_ i and you will see how truly i spoke of myself just now in saying i had no feelings and that all the relations i hold with my fellow creatures are mere business relations when you reflect that i have never seen you since no you have been the ward of tellson's house since and i have been busy with the other business of tellson's house since feelings i have no time for them no chance of them i pass my whole life miss in turning an immense pecuniary mangle after this odd description of his daily routine of employment mr lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which was most unnecessary for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before and resumed his former attitude so far miss as you have remarked this is the story of your regretted father now comes the difference if your father had not died when he did don't be frightened how you start she did indeed start and she caught his wrist with both her hands pray said mr lorry in a soothing tone bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble pray control your agitation a matter of business as i was saying her look so discomposed him that he stopped wandered and began anew as i was saying if monsieur manette had not died if he had suddenly and silently disappeared if he had been spirited away if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place though no art could trace him if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper across the water there for instance the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time if his wife had implored the king the queen the court the clergy for any tidings of him and all quite in vain then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman the doctor of beauvais i entreat you to tell me more sir i will i am going to you can bear it i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment you speak collectedly and you _are_ collected that's good though his manner was less satisfied than his words a matter of business regard it as a matter of business business that must be done now if this doctor's wife though a lady of great courage and spirit had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born the little child was a daughter sir a daughter a a matter of business don't be distressed miss if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead no don't kneel in heaven's name why should you kneel to me for the truth o dear good compassionate sir for the truth a a matter of business you confuse me and how can i transact business if i am confused let us be clear headed if you could kindly mention now for instance what nine times ninepence are or how many shillings in twenty guineas it would be so encouraging i should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind without directly answering to this appeal she sat so still when he had very gently raised her and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been that she communicated some reassurance to mr jarvis lorry that's right that's right courage business you have business before you useful business miss manette your mother took this course with you and when she died i believe broken hearted having never slackened her unavailing search for your father she left you at two years old to grow to be blooming beautiful and happy without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison or wasted there through many lingering years as he said the words he looked down with an admiring pity on the flowing golden hair as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey you know that your parents had no great possession and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you there has been no new discovery of money or of any other property but he felt his wrist held closer and he stopped the expression in the forehead which had so particularly attracted his notice and which was now immovable had deepened into one of pain and horror but he has been been found he is alive greatly changed it is too probable almost a wreck it is possible though we will hope the best still alive your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in paris and we are going there i to identify him if i can you to restore him to life love duty rest comfort a shiver ran through her frame and from it through his she said in a low distinct awe stricken voice as if she were saying it in a dream i am going to see his ghost it will be his ghost not him mr lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm there there there see now see now the best and the worst are known to you now you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman and with a fair sea voyage and a fair land journey you will be soon at his dear side she repeated in the same tone sunk to a whisper i have been free i have been happy yet his ghost has never haunted me only one thing more said mr lorry laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention he has been found under another name his own long forgotten or long concealed it would be worse than useless now to inquire which worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked or always designedly held prisoner it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries because it would be dangerous better not to mention the subject anywhere or in any way and to remove him for a while at all events out of france even i safe as an englishman and even tellson's important as they are to french credit avoid all naming of the matter i carry about me not a scrap of writing openly referring to it this is a secret service altogether my credentials entries and memoranda are all comprehended in the one line recalled to life which may mean anything but what is the matter she doesn't notice a word miss manette perfectly still and silent and not even fallen back in her chair she sat under his hand utterly insensible with her eyes open and fixed upon him and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead so close was her hold upon his arm that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving a wild looking woman whom even in his agitation mr lorry observed to be all of a red colour and to have red hair and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight fitting fashion and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure and good measure too or a great stilton cheese came running into the room in advance of the inn servants and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady by laying a brawny hand upon his chest and sending him flying back against the nearest wall i really think this must be a man was mr lorry's breathless reflection simultaneously with his coming against the wall why look at you all bawled this figure addressing the inn servants why don't you go and fetch things instead of standing there staring at me i am not so much to look at am i why don't you go and fetch things i'll let you know if you don't bring smelling salts cold water and vinegar quick i will there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives and she softly laid the patient on a sofa and tended her with great skill and gentleness calling her my precious and my bird and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care and you in brown she said indignantly turning to mr lorry couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her without frightening her to death look at her with her pretty pale face and her cold hands do you call _that_ being a banker mr lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer that he could only look on at a distance with much feebler sympathy and humility while the strong woman having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know something not mentioned if they stayed there staring recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder i hope she will do well now said mr lorry no thanks to you in brown if she does my darling pretty i hope said mr lorry after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility that you accompany miss manette to france a likely thing too replied the strong woman if it was ever intended that i should go across salt water do you suppose providence would have cast my lot in an island this being another question hard to answer mr jarvis lorry withdrew to consider it v the wine shop a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street the accident had happened in getting it out of a cart the cask had tumbled out with a run the hoops had burst and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine shop shattered like a walnut shell all the people within reach had suspended their business or their idleness to run to the spot and drink the wine the rough irregular stones of the street pointing every way and designed one might have thought expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them had dammed it into little pools these were surrounded each by its own jostling group or crowd according to its size some men kneeled down made scoops of their two hands joined and sipped or tried to help women who bent over their shoulders to sip before the wine had all run out between their fingers others men and women dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads which were squeezed dry into infants mouths others made small mud embankments to stem the wine as it ran others directed by lookers on up at high windows darted here and there to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee dyed pieces of the cask licking and even champing the moister wine rotted fragments with eager relish there was no drainage to carry off the wine and not only did it all get taken up but so much mud got taken up along with it that there might have been a scavenger in the street if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices voices of men women and children resounded in the street while this wine game lasted there was little roughness in the sport and much playfulness there was a special companionship in it an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one which led especially among the luckier or lighter hearted to frolicsome embraces drinking of healths shaking of hands and even joining of hands and dancing a dozen together when the wine was gone and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron pattern by fingers these demonstrations ceased as suddenly as they had broken out the man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting set it in motion again the women who had left on a door step the little pot of hot ashes at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes or in those of her child returned to it men with bare arms matted locks and cadaverous faces who had emerged into the winter light from cellars moved away to descend again and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine the wine was red wine and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of saint antoine in paris where it was spilled it had stained many hands too and many faces and many naked feet and many wooden shoes the hands of the man who sawed the wood left red marks on the billets and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again those who had been greedy with the"
