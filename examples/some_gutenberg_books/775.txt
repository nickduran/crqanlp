"1" "of his head involved a perception of extreme physical weakness he supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the valley but he could not recall that white edge he must have slept he remembered now that he had wanted to sleep he recalled the cliff and waterfall again and then recollected something about talking to a passer by how long had he slept what was that sound of pattering feet and that rise and fall like the murmur of breakers on pebbles he put out a languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place it and touched some smooth hard surface like glass this was so unexpected that it startled him extremely quite suddenly he rolled over stared for a moment and struggled into a sitting position the effort was unexpectedly difficult and it left him giddy and weak and amazed he rubbed his eyes the riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his mind was quite clear evidently his sleep had benefited him he was not in a bed at all as he understood the word but lying naked on a very soft and yielding mattress in a trough of dark glass the mattress was partly transparent a fact he observed with a strange sense of insecurity and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly about his arm and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow was bound a curious apparatus of rubber bound so cunningly that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below and this strange bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass as it seemed to him a bar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention in the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus for the most part quite strange appliances though a maximum and minimum thermometer was recognisable the slightly greenish tint of the glass like substance which surrounded him on every hand obscured what lay behind but he perceived it was a vast apartment of splendid appearance and with a very large and simple white archway facing him close to the walls of the cage were articles of furniture a table covered with a silvery cloth silvery like the side of a fish a couple of graceful chairs and on the table a number of dishes with substances piled on them a bottle and two glasses he realised that he was intensely hungry he could see no human being and after a period of hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his little apartment he had miscalculated his strength however and staggered and put his hand against the glasslike pane before him to steady himself for a moment it resisted his hand bending outward like a distended bladder then it broke with a slight report and vanished a pricked bubble he reeled out into the general space of the hall greatly astonished he caught at the table to save himself knocking one of the glasses to the floor it rang but did not break and sat down in one of the armchairs when he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the bottle and drank a colourless liquid it was but not water with a pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus he put down the vessel and looked about him the apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the greenish transparency that had intervened was removed the archway he saw led to a flight of steps going downward without the intermediation of a door to a spacious transverse passage this passage ran between polished pillars of some white veined substance of deep ultramarine and along it came the sound of human movements and voices and a deep undeviating droning note he sat now fully awake listening alertly forgetting the viands in his attention then with a shock he remembered that he was naked and casting about him for covering saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him this he wrapped about him and sat down again trembling his mind was still a surging perplexity clearly he had slept and had been removed in his sleep but here and who were those people the distant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars boscastle he poured out and partially drank another glass of the colourless fluid what was this place this place that to his senses seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive he looked about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apartment unstained by ornament and saw that the roof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light and as he looked a steady sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed and came again and passed beat beat that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued tumult that filled the air he would have called out but only a little sound came into his throat then he stood up and with the uncertain steps of a drunkard made his way towards the archway he staggered down the steps tripped on the corner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself and saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars the passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze a space like the interior of some gigantic building beyond and remote were vast and vague architectural forms the tumult of voices rose now loud and clear and on the balcony and with their backs to him gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation were three figures richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft colourings the noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the balcony and once it seemed the top of a banner passed and once some brightly coloured object a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the air perhaps flashed athwart the space and fell the shouts sounded like english there was a reiteration of wake he heard some indistinct shrill cry and abruptly the three men began laughing ha ha ha laughed one a red haired man in a short purple robe when the sleeper wakes _when he turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage his face changed the whole man changed became rigid the other two turned swiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless their faces assumed an expression of consternation an expression that deepened into awe suddenly graham's knees bent beneath him his arm against the pillar collapsed limply he staggered forward and fell upon his face chapter iv the sound of a tumult graham's last impression before he fainted was of a clamorous ringing of bells he learnt afterwards that he was insensible hanging between life and death for the better part of an hour when he recovered his senses he was back on his translucent couch and there was a stirring warmth at heart and throat the dark apparatus he perceived had been removed from his arm which was bandaged the white framework was still about him but the greenish transparent substance that had filled it was altogether gone a man in a deep violet robe one of those who had been on the balcony was looking keenly into his face remote but insistent was a clamour of bells and confused sounds that suggested to his mind the picture of a great number of people shouting together something seemed to fall across this tumult a door suddenly closed graham moved his head what does this all mean he said slowly where am i he saw the red haired man who had been first to discover him a voice seemed to be asking what he had said and was abruptly stilled the man in violet answered in a soft voice speaking english with a slightly foreign accent or so at least it seemed to the sleeper's ears you are quite safe you were brought hither from where you fell asleep it is quite safe you have been here some time sleeping in a trance he said something further that graham could not hear and a little phial was handed across to him graham felt a cooling spray a fragrant mist played over his forehead for a moment and his sense of refreshment increased he closed his eyes in satisfaction better asked the man in violet as graham's eyes reopened he was a pleasant faced man of thirty perhaps with a pointed flaxen beard and a clasp of gold at the neck of his violet robe yes said graham you have been asleep some time in a cataleptic trance you have heard catalepsy it may seem strange to you at first but i can assure you everything is well graham did not answer but these words served their reassuring purpose his eyes went from face to face of the three people about him they were regarding him strangely he knew he ought to be somewhere in cornwall but he could not square these things with that impression a matter that had been in his mind during his last waking moments at boscastle recurred a thing resolved upon and somehow neglected he cleared his throat have you wired my cousin he asked e warming 27 chancery lane they were all assiduous to hear but he had to repeat it what an odd _blurr_ in his accent whispered the red haired man wire sir said the young man with the flaxen beard evidently puzzled he means send an electric telegram volunteered the third a pleasant faced youth of nineteen or twenty the flaxen bearded man gave a cry of comprehension how stupid of me you may be sure everything shall be done sir he said to graham i am afraid it would be difficult to wire to your cousin he is not in london now but don't trouble about arrangements yet you have been asleep a very long time and the important thing is to get over that sir graham concluded the word was sir but this man pronounced it sire oh said graham and became quiet it was all very puzzling but apparently these people in unfamiliar dress knew what they were about yet they were odd and the room was odd it seemed he was in some newly established place he had a sudden flash of suspicion surely this wasn't some hall of public exhibition if it was he would give warming a piece of his mind but it scarcely had that character and in a place of public exhibition he would not have discovered himself naked then suddenly quite abruptly he realised what had happened there was no perceptible interval of suspicion no dawn to his knowledge abruptly he knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval as if by some processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in the faces that peered into his he looked at them strangely full of intense emotion it seemed they read his eyes he framed his lips to speak and could not a queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his mind almost at the moment of his discovery he looked at his bare feet regarding then silently his impulse to speak passed he was trembling exceedingly they gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty taste and the assurance of returning strength grew that that makes me feel better he said hoarsely and there were murmurs of respectful approval he knew now quite clearly he made to speak again and again he could not he pressed his throat and tried a third time how long he asked in a level voice how long have i been asleep some considerable time said the flaxen bearded man glancing quickly at the others how long a very long time yes yes said graham suddenly testy but i want is it it is some years many years there was something i forget what i feel confused but you he sobbed you need not fence with me how long he stopped breathing irregularly he squeezed his eyes with his knuckles and sat waiting for an answer they spoke in undertones five or six he asked faintly more very much more than that more more he looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the muscles of his face he looked his question many years said the man with the red beard graham struggled into a sitting position he wiped a rheumy tear from his face with a lean hand many years he repeated he shut his eyes tight opened them and sat looking about him from one unfamiliar thing to another how many years he asked you must be prepared to be surprised well more than a gross of years he was irritated at the strange word more than a _what_ two of them spoke together some quick remarks that were made about decimal he did not catch how long did you say asked graham how long don't look like that tell me among the remarks in an undertone his ear caught six words more than a couple of centuries what he cried turning on the youth who he thought had spoken who says what was that a couple of centuries yes said the man with the red beard two hundred years graham repeated the words he had been prepared to hear of a vast repose and yet these concrete centuries defeated him two hundred years he said again with the figure of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind and then oh but they said nothing you did you say two hundred years two centuries of years said the man with the red beard there was a pause graham looked at their faces and saw that what he had heard was indeed true but it can't be he said querulously i am dreaming trances trances don't last that is not right this is a joke you have played upon me tell me some days ago perhaps i was walking along the coast of cornwall his voice failed him the man with the flaxen beard hesitated i'm not very strong in history sir he said weakly and glanced at the others that was it sir said the youngster boscastle in the old duchy of cornwall it's in the southwest country beyond the dairy meadows there is a house there still i have been there boscastle graham turned his eyes to the youngster that was it boscastle little boscastle i fell asleep somewhere there i don't exactly remember i don't exactly remember he pressed his brows and whispered more than two hundred years he began to speak quickly with a twitching face but his heart was cold within him but if it is two hundred years every soul i know every human being that ever i saw or spoke to before i went to sleep must be dead they did not answer him the queen and the royal family her ministers of church and state high and low rich and poor one with another is there england still that's a comfort is there london eh this _is_ london eh and you are my assistant custodian assistant custodian and these eh assistant custodians to he sat with a gaunt stare on his face but why am i here no don't talk be quiet let me he sat silent rubbed his eyes and uncovering them found another little glass of pinkish fluid held towards him he took the dose it was almost immediately sustaining directly he had taken it he began to weep naturally and refreshingly presently he looked at their faces suddenly laughed through his tears a little foolishly but two hun dred years he said he grimaced hysterically and covered up his face again after a space he grew calm he sat up his hands hanging over his knees in almost precisely the same attitude in which isbister had found him on the cliff at pentargen his attention was attracted by a thick domineering voice the footsteps of an advancing personage what are you doing why was i not warned surely you could tell someone will suffer for this the man must be kept quiet are the doorways closed all the doorways he must be kept perfectly quiet he must not be told has he been told anything the man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark and graham looking over his shoulder saw approaching a very short fat and thickset beardless man with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin very thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes gave his face an oddly formidable expression he scowled momentarily at graham and then his regard returned to the man with the flaxen beard these others he said in a voice of extreme irritation you had better go go said the red bearded man certainly go now but see the doorways are closed as you go the two men addressed turned obediently after one reluctant glance at graham and instead of going through the archway as he expected walked straight to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway and then came a strange thing a long strip of this apparently solid wall rolled up with a snap hung over the two retreating men and fell again and immediately graham was alone with the new comer and the purple robed man with the flaxen beard for a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of graham but proceeded to interrogate the other obviously his subordinate upon the treatment of their charge he spoke clearly but in phrases only partially intelligible to graham the awakening seemed not only a matter of surprise but of consternation and annoyance to him he was evidently profoundly excited you must not confuse his mind by telling him things he repeated again and again you must not confuse his mind his questions answered he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper with an ambiguous expression feel queer he asked very the world what you see of it seems strange to you i suppose i have to live in it strange as it seems i suppose so now in the first place hadn't i better have some clothes they said the thickset man and stopped and the flaxen bearded man met his eye and went away you will very speedily have clothes said the thickset man is it true indeed that i have been asleep two hundred asked graham they have told you that have they two hundred and three as a matter of fact graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed mouth he sat silent for a moment and then asked a question is there a mill or dynamo near here he did not wait for an answer things have changed tremendously i suppose he said what is that shouting he asked abruptly nothing said the thickset man impatiently it's people you'll understand better later perhaps as you say things have changed he spoke shortly his brows were knit and he glanced about him like a man trying to decide in an emergency we must get you clothes and so forth at any rate better wait here until some can come no one will come near you you want shaving graham rubbed his chin the man with the flaxen beard came back towards them turned suddenly listened for a moment lifted his eyebrows at the older man and hurried off through the archway towards the balcony the tumult of shouting grew louder and the thickset man turned and listened also he cursed suddenly under his breath and turned his eyes upon graham with an unfriendly expression it was a surge of many voices rising and falling shouting and screaming and once came a sound like blows and sharp cries and then a snapping like the crackling of dry sticks graham strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the woven tumult then he perceived repeated again and again a certain formula for a time he doubted his ears but surely these were the words show us the sleeper show us the sleeper the thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway wild he cried how do they know do they know or is it guessing there was perhaps an answer i can't come said the thickset man i have _him_ to see to but shout from the balcony there was an inaudible reply say he is not awake anything i leave it to you he came hurrying back to graham you must have clothes at once he said you cannot stop here and it will be impossible to he rushed away graham shouting unanswered questions after him in a moment he was back i can't tell you what is happening it is too complex to explain in a moment you shall have your clothes made yes in a moment and then i can take you away from here you will find out our troubles soon enough but those voices they were shouting something about the sleeper that's you they have some twisted idea i don't know what it is i know nothing a shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote noises and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances in the corner of the room he listened for a moment regarding a ball of crystal nodded and said a few indistinct words then he walked to the wall through which the two men had vanished it rolled up again like a curtain and he stood waiting graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the restoratives had given him he thrust one leg over the side of the couch and then the other his head no longer swam he could scarcely credit his rapid recovery he sat feeling his limbs the man with the flaxen beard re entered from the archway and as he did so the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset man and a lean grey bearded man carrying a roll and wearing a tightly fitting costume of dark green appeared therein this is the tailor said the thickset man with an introductory gesture it will never do for you to wear that black i cannot understand how it got here but i shall i shall you will be as rapid as possible he said to the tailor the man in green bowed and advancing seated himself by graham on the bed his manner was calm but his eyes were full of curiosity you will find the fashions altered sire he said he glanced from under his brows at the thickset man he opened the roller with a quick movement and a confusion of brilliant fabrics poured out over his knees you lived sire in a period essentially cylindrical the victorian with a tendency to the hemisphere in hats circular curves always now he flicked out a little appliance the size and appearance of a keyless watch whirled the knob and behold a little figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion on the dial walking and turning the tailor caught up a pattern of bluish white satin that is my conception of your immediate treatment he said the thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of graham we have very little time he said trust me said the tailor my machine follows what do you think of this what is that asked the man from the nineteenth century in your days they showed you a fashion plate said the tailor but this is our modern development see here the little figure repeated its evolutions but in a different costume or this and with a click another small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched on to the dial the tailor was very quick in his movements and glanced twice towards the lift as he did these things it rumbled again and a crop haired anaemic lad with features of the chinese type clad in coarse pale blue canvas appeared together with a complicated machine which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into the room incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped graham was invited to stand in front of the machine and the tailor muttered some instructions to the crop haired lad who answered in guttural tones and with words graham did not recognise the boy then went to conduct an incomprehensible monologue in the corner and the tailor pulled out a number of slotted arms terminating in little discs pulling them out until the discs were flat against the body of graham one at each shoulder blade one at the elbows one at the neck and so forth so that at last there were perhaps two score of them upon his body and limbs at the same time some other person entered the room by the lift behind graham the tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a faint sounding rhythmic movement of parts in the machine and in another moment he was knocking up the levers and graham was released the tailor replaced his cloak of black and the man with the flaxen beard proffered him a little glass of some refreshing fluid graham saw over the rim of the glass a pale faced young man regarding him with a singular fixity the thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully and now turned and went through the archway towards the balcony from which the noise of a distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences the cropheaded lad handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began fixing this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine then they ran the entire thing on its easy noiseless bearings across the room to a remote corner where a twisted cable looped rather gracefully from the wall they made some connexion and the machine became energetic and swift what is that doing asked graham pointing with the empty glass to the busy figures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer is that some sort of force laid on yes said the man with the flaxen beard who is that he indicated the archway behind him the man in purple stroked his little beard hesitated and answered in an undertone he is howard your chief guardian you see sire it's a little difficult to explain the council appoints a guardian and assistants this hall has under certain restrictions been public in order that people might satisfy themselves we have barred the doorways for the first time but i think if you don't mind i will leave him to explain odd said graham guardian council then turning his back on the new comer he asked in an undertone why is this man glaring at me is he a mesmerist mesmerist he is a capillotomist capillotomist yes one of the chief his yearly fee is sixdoz lions it sounded sheer nonsense graham snatched at the last phrase with an unsteady mind sixdoz lions he said didn't you have lions i suppose not you had the old pounds they are our monetary units but what was that you said sixdoz yes six dozen sire of course things even these little things have altered you lived in the days of the decimal system the arab system tens and little hundreds and thousands we have eleven numerals now we have single figures for both ten and eleven two figures for a dozen and a dozen dozen makes a gross a great hundred you know a dozen gross a dozand and a dozand dozand a myriad very simple i suppose so said graham but about this cap what was it the man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder here are your clothes he said graham turned round sharply and saw the tailor standing at his elbow smiling and holding some palpably new garments over his arm the crop headed boy by means of one finger was impelling the complicated machine towards the lift by which he had arrived graham stared at the completed suit you don't mean to say just made said the tailor he dropped the garments at the feet of graham walked to the bed on which graham had so recently been lying flung out the translucent mattress and turned up the looking glass as he did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner the man with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by the archway the tailor was assisting graham into a dark purple combination garment stockings vest and pants in one as the thickset man came back from the corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the balcony they began speaking quickly in an undertone their bearing had an unmistakable quality of anxiety over the purple under garment came a complex but graceful garment of bluish white and i graham was clothed in the fashion once more and saw himself sallow faced unshaven and shaggy still but at least naked no longer and in some indefinable unprecedented way graceful i must shave he said regarding himself in the glass in a moment said howard the persistent stare ceased the young man closed his eyes reopened them and with a lean hand extended advanced on graham then he stopped with his hand slowly gesticulating and looked about him a seat said howard"
