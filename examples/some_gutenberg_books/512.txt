"1" "not be i submit replied she calmly and aylmer i shall quaff whatever draught you bring me but it will be on the same principle that would induce me to take a dose of poison if offered by your hand my noble wife said aylmer deeply moved i knew not the height and depth of your nature until now nothing shall be concealed know then that this crimson hand superficial as it seems has clutched its grasp into your being with a strength of which i had no previous conception i have already administered agents powerful enough to do aught except to change your entire physical system only one thing remains to be tried if that fail us we are ruined why did you hesitate to tell me this asked she because georgiana said aylmer in a low voice there is danger danger there is but one danger that this horrible stigma shall be left upon my cheek cried georgiana remove it remove it whatever be the cost or we shall both go mad heaven knows your words are too true said aylmer sadly and now dearest return to your boudoir in a little while all will be tested he conducted her back and took leave of her with a solemn tenderness which spoke far more than his words how much was now at stake after his departure georgiana became rapt in musings she considered the character of aylmer and did it completer justice than at any previous moment her heart exulted while it trembled at his honorable love so pure and lofty that it would accept nothing less than perfection nor miserably make itself contented with an earthlier nature than he had dreamed of she felt how much more precious was such a sentiment than that meaner kind which would have borne with the imperfection for her sake and have been guilty of treason to holy love by degrading its perfect idea to the level of the actual and with her whole spirit she prayed that for a single moment she might satisfy his highest and deepest conception longer than one moment she well knew it could not be for his spirit was ever on the march ever ascending and each instant required something that was beyond the scope of the instant before the sound of her husband's footsteps aroused her he bore a crystal goblet containing a liquor colorless as water but bright enough to be the draught of immortality aylmer was pale but it seemed rather the consequence of a highly wrought state of mind and tension of spirit than of fear or doubt the concoction of the draught has been perfect said he in answer to georgiana's look unless all my science have deceived me it cannot fail save on your account my dearest aylmer observed his wife i might wish to put off this birthmark of mortality by relinquishing mortality itself in preference to any other mode life is but a sad possession to those who have attained precisely the degree of moral advancement at which i stand were i weaker and blinder it might be happiness were i stronger it might be endured hopefully but being what i find myself methinks i am of all mortals the most fit to die you are fit for heaven without tasting death replied her husband but why do we speak of dying the draught cannot fail behold its effect upon this plant on the window seat there stood a geranium diseased with yellow blotches which had overspread all its leaves aylmer poured a small quantity of the liquid upon the soil in which it grew in a little time when the roots of the plant had taken up the moisture the unsightly blotches began to be extinguished in a living verdure there needed no proof said georgiana quietly give me the goblet i joyfully stake all upon your word drink then thou lofty creature exclaimed aylmer with fervid admiration there is no taint of imperfection on thy spirit thy sensible frame too shall soon be all perfect she quaffed the liquid and returned the goblet to his hand it is grateful said she with a placid smile methinks it is like water from a heavenly fountain for it contains i know not what of unobtrusive fragrance and deliciousness it allays a feverish thirst that had parched me for many days now dearest let me sleep my earthly senses are closing over my spirit like the leaves around the heart of a rose at sunset she spoke the last words with a gentle reluctance as if it required almost more energy than she could command to pronounce the faint and lingering syllables scarcely had they loitered through her lips ere she was lost in slumber aylmer sat by her side watching her aspect with the emotions proper to a man the whole value of whose existence was involved in the process now to be tested mingled with this mood however was the philosophic investigation characteristic of the man of science not the minutest symptom escaped him a heightened flush of the cheek a slight irregularity of breath a quiver of the eyelid a hardly perceptible tremor through the frame such were the details which as the moments passed he wrote down in his folio volume intense thought had set its stamp upon every previous page of that volume but the thoughts of years were all concentrated upon the last while thus employed he failed not to gaze often at the fatal hand and not without a shudder yet once by a strange and unaccountable impulse he pressed it with his lips his spirit recoiled however in the very act and georgiana out of the midst of her deep sleep moved uneasily and murmured as if in remonstrance again aylmer resumed his watch nor was it without avail the crimson hand which at first had been strongly visible upon the marble paleness of georgiana's cheek now grew more faintly outlined she remained not less pale than ever but the birthmark with every breath that came and went lost somewhat of its former distinctness its presence had been awful its departure was more awful still watch the stain of the rainbow fading out the sky and you will know how that mysterious symbol passed away by heaven it is well nigh gone said aylmer to himself in almost irrepressible ecstasy i can scarcely trace it now success success and now it is like the faintest rose color the lightest flush of blood across her cheek would overcome it but she is so pale he drew aside the window curtain and suffered the light of natural day to fall into the room and rest upon her cheek at the same time he heard a gross hoarse chuckle which he had long known as his servant aminadab's expression of delight ah clod ah earthly mass cried aylmer laughing in a sort of frenzy you have served me well matter and spirit earth and heaven have both done their part in this laugh thing of the senses you have earned the right to laugh these exclamations broke georgiana's sleep she slowly unclosed her eyes and gazed into the mirror which her husband had arranged for that purpose a faint smile flitted over her lips when she recognized how barely perceptible was now that crimson hand which had once blazed forth with such disastrous brilliancy as to scare away all their happiness but then her eyes sought aylmer's face with a trouble and anxiety that he could by no means account for my poor aylmer murmured she poor nay richest happiest most favored exclaimed he my peerless bride it is successful you are perfect my poor aylmer she repeated with a more than human tenderness you have aimed loftily you have done nobly do not repent that with so high and pure a feeling you have rejected the best the earth could offer aylmer dearest aylmer i am dying alas it was too true the fatal hand had grappled with the mystery of life and was the bond by which an angelic spirit kept itself in union with a mortal frame as the last crimson tint of the birthmark that sole token of human imperfection faded from her cheek the parting breath of the now perfect woman passed into the atmosphere and her soul lingering a moment near her husband took its heavenward flight then a hoarse chuckling laugh was heard again thus ever does the gross fatality of earth exult in its invariable triumph over the immortal essence which in this dim sphere of half development demands the completeness of a higher state yet had alymer reached a profounder wisdom he need not thus have flung away the happiness which would have woven his mortal life of the selfsame texture with the celestial the momentary circumstance was too strong for him he failed to look beyond the shadowy scope of time and living once for all in eternity to find the perfect future in the present young goodman brown young goodman brown came forth at sunset into the street at salem village but put his head back after crossing the threshold to exchange a parting kiss with his young wife and faith as the wife was aptly named thrust her own pretty head into the street letting the wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to goodman brown dearest heart whispered she softly and rather sadly when her lips were close to his ear prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to night a lone woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of herself sometimes pray tarry with me this night dear husband of all nights in the year my love and my faith replied young goodman brown of all nights in the year this one night must i tarry away from thee my journey as thou callest it forth and back again must needs be done twixt now and sunrise what my sweet pretty wife dost thou doubt me already and we but three months married then god bless you said faith with the pink ribbons and may you find all well when you come back amen cried goodman brown say thy prayers dear faith and go to bed at dusk and no harm will come to thee so they parted and the young man pursued his way until being about to turn the corner by the meeting house he looked back and saw the head of faith still peeping after him with a melancholy air in spite of her pink ribbons poor little faith thought he for his heart smote him what a wretch am i to leave her on such an errand she talks of dreams too methought as she spoke there was trouble in her face as if a dream had warned her what work is to be done tonight but no no t would kill her to think it well she's a blessed angel on earth and after this one night i'll cling to her skirts and follow her to heaven with this excellent resolve for the future goodman brown felt himself justified in making more haste on his present evil purpose he had taken a dreary road darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep through and closed immediately behind it was all as lonely as could be and there is this peculiarity in such a solitude that the traveller knows not who may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughs overhead so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen multitude there may be a devilish indian behind every tree said goodman brown to himself and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added what if the devil himself should be at my very elbow his head being turned back he passed a crook of the road and looking forward again beheld the figure of a man in grave and decent attire seated at the foot of an old tree he arose at goodman brown's approach and walked onward side by side with him you are late goodman brown said he the clock of the old south was striking as i came through boston and that is full fifteen minutes agone faith kept me back a while replied the young man with a tremor in his voice caused by the sudden appearance of his companion though not wholly unexpected it was now deep dusk in the forest and deepest in that part of it where these two were journeying as nearly as could be discerned the second traveller was about fifty years old apparently in the same rank of life as goodman brown and bearing a considerable resemblance to him though perhaps more in expression than features still they might have been taken for father and son and yet though the elder person was as simply clad as the younger and as simple in manner too he had an indescribable air of one who knew the world and who would not have felt abashed at the governor's dinner table or in king william's court were it possible that his affairs should call him thither but the only thing about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff which bore the likeness of a great black snake so curiously wrought that it might almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself like a living serpent this of course must have been an ocular deception assisted by the uncertain light come goodman brown cried his fellow traveller this is a dull pace for the beginning of a journey take my staff if you are so soon weary friend said the other exchanging his slow pace for a full stop having kept covenant by meeting thee here it is my purpose now to return whence i came i have scruples touching the matter thou wot'st of sayest thou so replied he of the serpent smiling apart let us walk on nevertheless reasoning as we go and if i convince thee not thou shalt turn back we are but a little way in the forest yet too far too far exclaimed the goodman unconsciously resuming his walk my father never went into the woods on such an errand nor his father before him we have been a race of honest men and good christians since the days of the martyrs and shall i be the first of the name of brown that ever took this path and kept such company thou wouldst say observed the elder person interpreting his pause well said goodman brown i have been as well acquainted with your family as with ever a one among the puritans and that's no trifle to say i helped your grandfather the constable when he lashed the quaker woman so smartly through the streets of salem and it was i that brought your father a pitch pine knot kindled at my own hearth to set fire to an indian village in king philip's war they were my good friends both and many a pleasant walk have we had along this path and returned merrily after midnight i would fain be friends with you for their sake if it be as thou sayest replied goodman brown i marvel they never spoke of these matters or verily i marvel not seeing that the least rumor of the sort would have driven them from new england we are a people of prayer and good works to boot and abide no such wickedness wickedness or not said the traveller with the twisted staff i have a very general acquaintance here in new england the deacons of many a church have drunk the communion wine with me the selectmen of divers towns make me their chairman and a majority of the great and general court are firm supporters of my interest the governor and i too but these are state secrets can this be so cried goodman brown with a stare of amazement at his undisturbed companion howbeit i have nothing to do with the governor and council they have their own ways and are no rule for a simple husbandman like me but were i to go on with thee how should i meet the eye of that good old man our minister at salem village oh his voice would make me tremble both sabbath day and lecture day thus far the elder traveller had listened with due gravity but now burst into a fit of irrepressible mirth shaking himself so violently that his snake like staff actually seemed to wriggle in sympathy ha ha ha shouted he again and again then composing himself well go on goodman brown go on but prithee don't kill me with laughing well then to end the matter at once said goodman brown considerably nettled there is my wife faith it would break her dear little heart and i'd rather break my own nay if that be the case answered the other e'en go thy ways goodman brown i would not for twenty old women like the one hobbling before us that faith should come to any harm as he spoke he pointed his staff at a female figure on the path in whom goodman brown recognized a very pious and exemplary dame who had taught him his catechism in youth and was still his moral and spiritual adviser jointly with the minister and deacon gookin a marvel truly that goody cloyse should be so far in the wilderness at nightfall said he but with your leave friend i shall take a cut through the woods until we have left this christian woman behind being a stranger to you she might ask whom i was consorting with and whither i was going be it so said his fellow traveller betake you to the woods and let me keep the path accordingly the young man turned aside but took care to watch his companion who advanced softly along the road until he had come within a staff's length of the old dame she meanwhile was making the best of her way with singular speed for so aged a woman and mumbling some indistinct words a prayer doubtless as she went the traveller put forth his staff and touched her withered neck with what seemed the serpent's tail the devil screamed the pious old lady then goody cloyse knows her old friend observed the traveller confronting her and leaning on his writhing stick ah forsooth and is it your worship indeed cried the good dame yea truly is it and in the very image of my old gossip goodman brown the grandfather of the silly fellow that now is but would your worship believe it my broomstick hath strangely disappeared stolen as i suspect by that unhanged witch goody cory and that too when i was all anointed with the juice of smallage and cinquefoil and wolf's bane mingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new born babe said the shape of old goodman brown ah your worship knows the recipe cried the old lady cackling aloud so as i was saying being all ready for the meeting and no horse to ride on i made up my mind to foot it for they tell me there is a nice young man to be taken into communion to night but now your good worship will lend me your arm and we shall be there in a twinkling that can hardly be answered her friend i may not spare you my arm goody cloyse but here is my staff if you will so saying he threw it down at her feet where perhaps it assumed life being one of the rods which its owner had formerly lent to the egyptian magi of this fact however goodman brown could not take cognizance he had cast up his eyes in astonishment and looking down again beheld neither goody cloyse nor the serpentine staff but his fellow traveller alone who waited for him as calmly as if nothing had happened that old woman taught me my catechism said the young man and there was a world of meaning in this simple comment they continued to walk onward while the elder traveller exhorted his companion to make good speed and persevere in the path discoursing so aptly that his arguments seemed rather to spring up in the bosom of his auditor than to be suggested by himself as they went he plucked a branch of maple to serve for a walking stick and began to strip it of the twigs and little boughs which were wet with evening dew the moment his fingers touched them they became strangely withered and dried up as with a week's sunshine thus the pair proceeded at a good free pace until suddenly in a gloomy hollow of the road goodman brown sat himself down on the stump of a tree and refused to go any farther friend said he stubbornly my mind is made up not another step will i budge on this errand what if a wretched old woman do choose to go to the devil when i thought she was going to heaven is that any reason why i should quit my dear faith and go after her you will think better of this by and by said his acquaintance composedly sit here and rest yourself a while and when you feel like moving again there is my staff to help you along without more words he threw his companion the maple stick and was as speedily out of sight as if he had vanished into the deepening gloom the young man sat a few moments by the roadside applauding himself greatly and thinking with how clear a conscience he should meet the minister in his morning walk nor shrink from the eye of good old deacon gookin and what calm sleep would be his that very night which was to have been spent so wickedly but so purely and sweetly now in the arms of faith amidst these pleasant and praiseworthy meditations goodman brown heard the tramp of horses along the road and deemed it advisable to conceal himself within the verge of the forest conscious of the guilty purpose that had brought him thither though now so happily turned from it on came the hoof tramps and the voices of the riders two grave old voices conversing soberly as they drew near these mingled sounds appeared to pass along the road within a few yards of the young man's hiding place but owing doubtless to the depth of the gloom at that particular spot neither the travellers nor their steeds were visible though their figures brushed the small boughs by the wayside it could not be seen that they intercepted even for a moment the faint gleam from the strip of bright sky athwart which they must have passed goodman brown alternately crouched and stood on tiptoe pulling aside the branches and thrusting forth his head as far as he durst without discerning so much as a shadow it vexed him the more because he could have sworn were such a thing possible that he recognized the voices of the minister and deacon gookin jogging along quietly as they were wont to do when bound to some ordination or ecclesiastical council while yet within hearing one of the riders stopped to pluck a switch of the two reverend sir said the voice like the deacon's i had rather miss an ordination dinner than to night's meeting they tell me that some of our community are to be here from falmouth and beyond and others from connecticut and rhode island besides several of the indian powwows who after their fashion know almost as much deviltry as the best of us moreover there is a goodly young woman to be taken into communion mighty well deacon gookin replied the solemn old tones of the minister spur up or we shall be late nothing can be done you know until i get on the ground the hoofs clattered again and the voices talking so strangely in the empty air passed on through the forest where no church had ever been gathered or solitary christian prayed whither then could these holy men be journeying so deep into the heathen wilderness young goodman brown caught hold of a tree for support being ready to sink down on the ground faint and overburdened with the heavy sickness of his heart he looked up to the sky doubting whether there really was a heaven above him yet there was the blue arch and the stars brightening in it with heaven above and faith below i will yet stand firm against the devil cried goodman brown while he still gazed upward into the deep arch of the firmament and had lifted his hands to pray a cloud though no wind was stirring hurried across the zenith and hid the brightening stars the blue sky was still visible except directly overhead where this black mass of cloud was sweeping swiftly northward aloft in the air as if from the depths of the cloud came a confused and doubtful sound of voices once the listener fancied that he could distinguish the accents of towns people of his own men and women both pious and ungodly many of whom he had met at the communion table and had seen others rioting at the tavern the next moment so indistinct were the sounds he doubted whether he had heard aught but the murmur of the old forest whispering without a wind then came a stronger swell of those familiar tones heard daily in the sunshine at salem village but never until now from a cloud of night there was one voice of a young woman uttering lamentations yet with an uncertain sorrow and entreating for some favor which perhaps it would grieve her to obtain and all the unseen multitude both saints and sinners seemed to encourage her onward faith shouted goodman brown in a voice of agony and desperation and the echoes of the forest mocked him crying faith faith as if bewildered wretches were seeking her all through the wilderness the cry of grief rage and terror was yet piercing the night when the unhappy husband held his breath for a response there was a scream drowned immediately in a louder murmur of voices fading into far off laughter as the dark cloud swept away leaving the clear and silent sky above goodman brown but something fluttered lightly down through the air and caught on the branch of a tree the young man seized it and beheld a pink ribbon my faith is gone cried he after one stupefied moment there is no good on earth and sin is but a name come devil for to thee is this world given and maddened with despair so that he laughed loud and long did goodman brown grasp his staff and set forth again at such a rate that he seemed to fly along the forest path rather than to walk or run the road grew wilder and drearier and more faintly traced and vanished at length leaving him in the heart of the dark wilderness still rushing onward with the instinct that guides mortal man to evil the whole forest was peopled with frightful sounds the creaking of the trees the howling of wild beasts and the yell of indians while sometimes the wind tolled like a distant church bell and sometimes gave a broad roar around the traveller as if all nature were laughing him to scorn but he was himself the chief horror of the scene and shrank not from its other horrors ha ha ha roared goodman brown when the wind laughed at him let us hear which will laugh loudest think not to frighten me with your deviltry come witch come wizard come indian powwow come devil himself and here comes goodman brown you may as well fear him as he fear you in truth all through the haunted forest there could be nothing more frightful than the figure of goodman brown on he flew among the black pines brandishing his staff with frenzied gestures now giving vent to an inspiration of horrid blasphemy and now shouting forth such laughter as set all the echoes of the forest laughing like demons around him the fiend in his own shape is less hideous than when he rages in the breast of man thus sped the demoniac on his course until quivering among the trees he saw a red light before him as when the felled trunks and branches of a clearing have been set on fire and throw up their lurid blaze against the sky at the hour of midnight he paused in a lull of the tempest that had driven him onward and heard the swell of what seemed a hymn rolling solemnly from a distance with the weight of many voices he knew the tune it was a familiar one in the choir of the village meeting house the verse died heavily away and was lengthened by a chorus not of human voices but of all the sounds of the benighted wilderness pealing in awful harmony together goodman brown cried out and his cry was lost to his own ear by its unison with the cry of the desert in the interval of silence he stole forward until the light glared full upon his eyes at one extremity of an open space hemmed in by the dark wall of the forest arose a rock bearing some rude natural resemblance either to an altar or a pulpit and surrounded by four blazing pines their"
