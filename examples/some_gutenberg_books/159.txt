"1" "been now this damped my mood a little at any rate i began it's a chance i tell you he interrupted as everything is in a man's life only the asses won't see it why am i here now an outcast from civilisation instead of being a happy man enjoying all the pleasures of london simply because eleven years ago i lost my head for ten minutes on a foggy night he stopped yes said i that's all we relapsed into silence presently he laughed there's something in this starlight that loosens one's tongue i'm an ass and yet somehow i would like to tell you whatever you tell me you may rely upon my keeping to myself if that's it he was on the point of beginning and then shook his head doubtfully don't said i it is all the same to me after all it is better to keep your secret there's nothing gained but a little relief if i respect your confidence if i don't well he grunted undecidedly i felt i had him at a disadvantage had caught him in the mood of indiscretion and to tell the truth i was not curious to learn what might have driven a young medical student out of london i have an imagination i shrugged my shoulders and turned away over the taffrail leant a silent black figure watching the stars it was montgomery's strange attendant it looked over its shoulder quickly with my movement then looked away again it may seem a little thing to you perhaps but it came like a sudden blow to me the only light near us was a lantern at the wheel the creature's face was turned for one brief instant out of the dimness of the stern towards this illumination and i saw that the eyes that glanced at me shone with a pale green light i did not know then that a reddish luminosity at least is not uncommon in human eyes the thing came to me as stark inhumanity that black figure with its eyes of fire struck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings and for a moment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind then the effect passed as it had come an uncouth black figure of a man a figure of no particular import hung over the taffrail against the starlight and i found montgomery was speaking to me i'm thinking of turning in then said he if you've had enough of this i answered him incongruously we went below and he wished me good night at the door of my cabin that night i had some very unpleasant dreams the waning moon rose late its light struck a ghostly white beam across my cabin and made an ominous shape on the planking by my bunk then the staghounds woke and began howling and baying so that i dreamt fitfully and scarcely slept until the approach of dawn v the man who had nowhere to go in the early morning it was the second morning after my recovery and i believe the fourth after i was picked up i awoke through an avenue of tumultuous dreams dreams of guns and howling mobs and became sensible of a hoarse shouting above me i rubbed my eyes and lay listening to the noise doubtful for a little while of my whereabouts then came a sudden pattering of bare feet the sound of heavy objects being thrown about a violent creaking and the rattling of chains i heard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenly brought round and a foamy yellow green wave flew across the little round window and left it streaming i jumped into my clothes and went on deck as i came up the ladder i saw against the flushed sky for the sun was just rising the broad back and red hair of the captain and over his shoulder the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on to the mizzen spanker boom the poor brute seemed horribly scared and crouched in the bottom of its little cage overboard with em bawled the captain overboard with em we'll have a clean ship soon of the whole bilin of em he stood in my way so that i had perforce to tap his shoulder to come on deck he came round with a start and staggered back a few paces to stare at me it needed no expert eye to tell that the man was still drunk hullo said he stupidly and then with a light coming into his eyes why it's mister mister prendick said i prendick be damned said he shut up that's your name mister shut up it was no good answering the brute but i certainly did not expect his next move he held out his hand to the gangway by which montgomery stood talking to a massive grey haired man in dirty blue flannels who had apparently just come aboard that way mister blasted shut up that way roared the captain montgomery and his companion turned as he spoke what do you mean i said that way mister blasted shut up that's what i mean overboard mister shut up and sharp we're cleaning the ship out cleaning the whole blessed ship out and overboard you go i stared at him dumfounded then it occurred to me that it was exactly the thing i wanted the lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger with this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over i turned towards montgomery can't have you said montgomery's companion concisely you can't have me said i aghast he had the squarest and most resolute face i ever set eyes upon look here i began turning to the captain overboard said the captain this ship aint for beasts and cannibals and worse than beasts any more overboard you go mister shut up if they can't have you you goes overboard but anyhow you go with your friends i've done with this blessed island for evermore amen i've had enough of it but montgomery i appealed he distorted his lower lip and nodded his head hopelessly at the grey haired man beside him to indicate his powerlessness to help me i'll see to _you_ presently said the captain then began a curious three cornered altercation alternately i appealed to one and another of the three men first to the grey haired man to let me land and then to the drunken captain to keep me aboard i even bawled entreaties to the sailors montgomery said never a word only shook his head you're going overboard i tell you was the captain's refrain law be damned i'm king here at last i must confess my voice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorous threat i felt a gust of hysterical petulance and went aft and stared dismally at nothing meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of unshipping the packages and caged animals a large launch with two standing lugs lay under the lee of the schooner and into this the strange assortment of goods were swung i did not then see the hands from the island that were receiving the packages for the hull of the launch was hidden from me by the side of the schooner neither montgomery nor his companion took the slightest notice of me but busied themselves in assisting and directing the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods the captain went forward interfering rather than assisting i was alternately despairful and desperate once or twice as i stood waiting there for things to accomplish themselves i could not resist an impulse to laugh at my miserable quandary i felt all the wretcheder for the lack of a breakfast hunger and a lack of blood corpuscles take all the manhood from a man i perceived pretty clearly that i had not the stamina either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me or to force myself upon montgomery and his companion so i waited passively upon fate and the work of transferring montgomery's possessions to the launch went on as if i did not exist presently that work was finished and then came a struggle i was hauled resisting weakly enough to the gangway even then i noticed the oddness of the brown faces of the men who were with montgomery in the launch but the launch was now fully laden and was shoved off hastily a broadening gap of green water appeared under me and i pushed back with all my strength to avoid falling headlong the hands in the launch shouted derisively and i heard montgomery curse at them and then the captain the mate and one of the seamen helping him ran me aft towards the stern the dingey of the lady vain had been towing behind it was half full of water had no oars and was quite unvictualled i refused to go aboard her and flung myself full length on the deck in the end they swung me into her by a rope for they had no stern ladder and then they cut me adrift i drifted slowly from the schooner in a kind of stupor i watched all hands take to the rigging and slowly but surely she came round to the wind the sails fluttered and then bellied out as the wind came into them i stared at her weather beaten side heeling steeply towards me and then she passed out of my range of view i did not turn my head to follow her at first i could scarcely believe what had happened i crouched in the bottom of the dingey stunned and staring blankly at the vacant oily sea then i realised that i was in that little hell of mine again now half swamped and looking back over the gunwale i saw the schooner standing away from me with the red haired captain mocking at me over the taffrail and turning towards the island saw the launch growing smaller as she approached the beach abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me i had no means of reaching the land unless i should chance to drift there i was still weak you must remember from my exposure in the boat i was empty and very faint or i should have had more heart but as it was i suddenly began to sob and weep as i had never done since i was a little child the tears ran down my face in a passion of despair i struck with my fists at the water in the bottom of the boat and kicked savagely at the gunwale i prayed aloud for god to let me die vi the evil looking boatmen but the islanders seeing that i was really adrift took pity on me i drifted very slowly to the eastward approaching the island slantingly and presently i saw with hysterical relief the launch come round and return towards me she was heavily laden and i could make out as she drew nearer montgomery's white haired broad shouldered companion sitting cramped up with the dogs and several packing cases in the stern sheets this individual stared fixedly at me without moving or speaking the black faced cripple was glaring at me as fixedly in the bows near the puma there were three other men besides three strange brutish looking fellows at whom the staghounds were snarling savagely montgomery who was steering brought the boat by me and rising caught and fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me for there was no room aboard i had recovered from my hysterical phase by this time and answered his hail as he approached bravely enough i told him the dingey was nearly swamped and he reached me a piggin i was jerked back as the rope tightened between the boats for some time i was busy baling it was not until i had got the water under for the water in the dingey had been shipped the boat was perfectly sound that i had leisure to look at the people in the launch again the white haired man i found was still regarding me steadfastly but with an expression as i now fancied of some perplexity when my eyes met his he looked down at the staghound that sat between his knees he was a powerfully built man as i have said with a fine forehead and rather heavy features but his eyes had that odd drooping of the skin above the lids which often comes with advancing years and the fall of his heavy mouth at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious resolution he talked to montgomery in a tone too low for me to hear from him my eyes travelled to his three men and a strange crew they were i saw only their faces yet there was something in their faces i knew not what that gave me a queer spasm of disgust i looked steadily at them and the impression did not pass though i failed to see what had occasioned it they seemed to me then to be brown men but their limbs were oddly swathed in some thin dirty white stuff down even to the fingers and feet i have never seen men so wrapped up before and women so only in the east they wore turbans too and thereunder peered out their elfin faces at me faces with protruding lower jaws and bright eyes they had lank black hair almost like horsehair and seemed as they sat to exceed in stature any race of men i have seen the white haired man who i knew was a good six feet in height sat a head below any one of the three i found afterwards that really none were taller than myself but their bodies were abnormally long and the thigh part of the leg short and curiously twisted at any rate they were an amazingly ugly gang and over the heads of them under the forward lug peered the black face of the man whose eyes were luminous in the dark as i stared at them they met my gaze and then first one and then another turned away from my direct stare and looked at me in an odd furtive manner it occurred to me that i was perhaps annoying them and i turned my attention to the island we were approaching it was low and covered with thick vegetation chiefly a kind of palm that was new to me from one point a thin white thread of vapour rose slantingly to an immense height and then frayed out like a down feather we were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on either hand by a low promontory the beach was of dull grey sand and sloped steeply up to a ridge perhaps sixty or seventy feet above the sea level and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth half way up was a square enclosure of some greyish stone which i found subsequently was built partly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava two thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure a man stood awaiting us at the water's edge i fancied while we were still far off that i saw some other and very grotesque looking creatures scuttle into the bushes upon the slope but i saw nothing of these as we drew nearer this man was of a moderate size and with a black negroid face he had a large almost lipless mouth extraordinary lank arms long thin feet and bow legs and stood with his heavy face thrust forward staring at us he was dressed like montgomery and his white haired companion in jacket and trousers of blue serge as we came still nearer this individual began to run to and fro on the beach making the most grotesque movements at a word of command from montgomery the four men in the launch sprang up and with singularly awkward gestures struck the lugs montgomery steered us round and into a narrow little dock excavated in the beach then the man on the beach hastened towards us this dock as i call it was really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of the tide to take the longboat i heard the bows ground in the sand staved the dingey off the rudder of the big boat with my piggin and freeing the painter landed the three muffled men with the clumsiest movements scrambled out upon the sand and forthwith set to landing the cargo assisted by the man on the beach i was struck especially by the curious movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged boatmen not stiff they were but distorted in some odd way almost as if they were jointed in the wrong place the dogs were still snarling and strained at their chains after these men as the white haired man landed with them the three big fellows spoke to one another in odd guttural tones and the man who had waited for us on the beach began chattering to them excitedly a foreign language as i fancied as they laid hands on some bales piled near the stern somewhere i had heard such a voice before and i could not think where the white haired man stood holding in a tumult of six dogs and bawling orders over their din montgomery having unshipped the rudder landed likewise and all set to work at unloading i was too faint what with my long fast and the sun beating down on my bare head to offer any assistance presently the white haired man seemed to recollect my presence and came up to me you look said he as though you had scarcely breakfasted his little eyes were a brilliant black under his heavy brows i must apologise for that now you are our guest we must make you comfortable though you are uninvited you know he looked keenly into my face montgomery says you are an educated man mr prendick says you know something of science may i ask what that signifies i told him i had spent some years at the royal college of science and had done some researches in biology under huxley he raised his eyebrows slightly at that that alters the case a little mr prendick he said with a trifle more respect in his manner as it happens we are biologists here this is a biological station of a sort his eye rested on the men in white who were busily hauling the puma on rollers towards the walled yard i and montgomery at least he added then when you will be able to get away i can't say we're off the track to anywhere we see a ship once in a twelve month or so he left me abruptly and went up the beach past this group and i think entered the enclosure the other two men were with montgomery erecting a pile of smaller packages on a low wheeled truck the llama was still on the launch with the rabbit hutches the staghounds were still lashed to the thwarts the pile of things completed all three men laid hold of the truck and began shoving the ton weight or so upon it after the puma presently montgomery left them and coming back to me held out his hand i'm glad said he for my own part that captain was a silly ass he'd have made things lively for you it was you said i that saved me again that depends you'll find this island an infernally rum place i promise you i'd watch my goings carefully if i were you _he_ he hesitated and seemed to alter his mind about what was on his lips i wish you'd help me with these rabbits he said his procedure with the rabbits was singular i waded in with him and helped him lug one of the hutches ashore no sooner was that done than he opened the door of it and tilting the thing on one end turned its living contents out on the ground they fell in a struggling heap one on the top of the other he clapped his hands and forthwith they went off with that hopping run of theirs fifteen or twenty of them i should think up the beach increase and multiply my friends said montgomery replenish the island hitherto we've had a certain lack of meat here as i watched them disappearing the white haired man returned with a brandy flask and some biscuits something to go on with prendick said he in a far more familiar tone than before i made no ado but set to work on the biscuits at once while the white haired man helped montgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits three big hutches however went up to the house with the puma the brandy i did not touch for i have been an abstainer from my birth vii the locked door the reader will perhaps understand that at first everything was so strange about me and my position was the outcome of such unexpected adventures that i had no discernment of the relative strangeness of this or that thing i followed the llama up the beach and was overtaken by montgomery who asked me not to enter the stone enclosure i noticed then that the puma in its cage and the pile of packages had been placed outside the entrance to this quadrangle i turned and saw that the launch had now been unloaded run out again and was being beached and the white haired man was walking towards us he addressed montgomery and now comes the problem of this uninvited guest what are we to do with him he knows something of science said montgomery i'm itching to get to work again with this new stuff said the white haired man nodding towards the enclosure his eyes grew brighter i daresay you are said montgomery in anything but a cordial tone we can't send him over there and we can't spare the time to build him a new shanty and we certainly can't take him into our confidence just yet i'm in your hands said i i had no idea of what he meant by over there i've been thinking of the same things montgomery answered there's my room with the outer door that's it said the elder man promptly looking at montgomery and all three of us went towards the enclosure i'm sorry to make a mystery mr prendick but you'll remember you're uninvited our little establishment here contains a secret or so is a kind of blue beard's chamber in fact nothing very dreadful really to a sane man but just now as we don't know you decidedly said i i should be a fool to take offence at any want of confidence he twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile he was one of those saturnine people who smile with the corners of the mouth down and bowed his acknowledgment of my complaisance the main entrance to the enclosure was passed it was a heavy wooden gate framed in iron and locked with the cargo of the launch piled outside it and at the corner we came to a small doorway i had not previously observed the white haired man produced a bundle of keys from the pocket of his greasy blue jacket opened this door and entered his keys and the elaborate locking up of the place even while it was still under his eye struck me as peculiar i followed him and found myself in a small apartment plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with its inner door which was slightly ajar opening into a paved courtyard this inner door montgomery at once closed a hammock was slung across the darker corner of the room and a small unglazed window defended by an iron bar looked out towards the sea this the white haired man told me was to be my apartment and the inner door which for fear of accidents he said he would lock on the other side was my limit inward he called my attention to a convenient deck chair before the window and to an array of old books chiefly i found surgical works and editions of the latin and greek classics languages i cannot read with any comfort on a shelf near the hammock he left the room by the outer door as if to avoid opening the inner one again we usually have our meals in here said montgomery and then as if in doubt went out after the other moreau i heard him call and for the moment i do not think i noticed then as i handled the books on the shelf it came up in consciousness where had i heard the name of moreau before i sat down before the window took out the biscuits that still remained to me and ate them with an excellent appetite moreau through the window i saw one of those unaccountable men in white lugging a packing case along the beach presently the window frame hid him then i heard a key inserted and turned in the lock behind me after a little while i heard through the locked door the noise of the staghounds that had now been brought up from the beach they were not barking but sniffing and growling in a curious fashion i could hear the rapid patter of their feet and montgomery's voice soothing them i was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men regarding the contents of the place and for some time i was thinking of that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of moreau but so odd is the human memory that i could not then recall that well known name in its proper connection from that my thoughts went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach i never saw such a gait such odd motions as he pulled at the box i recalled that none of these men had spoken to me though most of them i had found looking at me at one time or another in a peculiarly furtive manner quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage indeed they had all seemed remarkably taciturn and when they did speak endowed with very uncanny voices what was wrong with them then i recalled the eyes of montgomery's ungainly attendant just as i was thinking of him he came in he was now dressed in white and carried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon i could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came bending amiably and placed the tray before me on the table then astonishment paralysed me under his stringy black locks i saw his ear it jumped upon me suddenly close to my face the man had pointed ears covered with a fine brown fur your breakfast sair he said i stared at his face without attempting to answer him he turned and went towards the door regarding me oddly over his shoulder i followed him out with my eyes and as i did so by some odd trick of unconscious cerebration there came surging into my head the phrase the moreau hollows was it the moreau ah it sent my memory back ten years the moreau horrors the phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment and then i saw it in red lettering on a little buff coloured pamphlet to read which made one shiver and creep then i remembered distinctly all about it that long forgotten pamphlet came back with startling vividness to my mind i had been a mere lad then and moreau was i suppose about fifty a prominent and masterful physiologist well known in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagination and his brutal directness in discussion was this the same moreau he had published some very astonishing facts in connection with the transfusion of blood and in addition was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths then suddenly his career was closed he had to leave england a journalist obtained access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory assistant with the deliberate intention of making sensational exposures and by the help of a shocking accident if it was an accident his gruesome pamphlet became notorious on the day of its publication a wretched dog flayed and otherwise mutilated escaped from moreau's house it was in the silly season and a prominent editor a cousin of the temporary laboratory assistant appealed to the conscience of the nation it was not the first time that conscience has turned against the methods of research the doctor was simply howled out of the country it may be that he deserved to be but i still think that the tepid support of his fellow investigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific workers was a shameful thing yet some of his experiments by the journalist's account were wantonly cruel he might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations but he apparently preferred the latter as most men would who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research he was unmarried and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider i felt convinced that this must be the same man everything pointed to it it dawned upon me to what end the puma and the other animals which had now been brought with other luggage into the enclosure behind the house were destined and a curious faint odour the halitus of something familiar an odour that had been in the"
