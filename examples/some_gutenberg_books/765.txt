"1" "hold during the full moon that's why they were so eager to have us _keep_ away too the explanation seemed good i felt a curious sense of relief although i had not been sensible of any oppression let's slip over suggested stanton but i would not they're a difficult lot as it is i said if we break into one of their religious ceremonies they'll probably never forgive us let's keep out of any family party where we haven't been invited that's so agreed stanton the strange tinkling rose and fell rose and fell there's something something very unsettling about it said edith at last soberly i wonder what they make those sounds with they frighten me half to death and at the same time they make me feel as though some enormous rapture were just around the corner it's devilish uncanny broke in stanton and as he spoke the flap of thora's tent was raised and out into the moonlight strode the old swede she was the great norse type tall deep breasted moulded on the old viking lines her sixty years had slipped from her she looked like some ancient priestess of odin she stood there her eyes wide brilliant staring she thrust her head forward toward nan tauach regarding the moving lights she listened suddenly she raised her arms and made a curious gesture to the moon it was an archaic movement she seemed to drag it from remote antiquity yet in it was a strange suggestion of power twice she repeated this gesture and the tinklings died away she turned to us go she said and her voice seemed to come from far distances go from here and quickly go while you may it has called she pointed to the islet it knows you are here it waits she wailed it beckons the the she fell at edith's feet and over the lagoon came again the tinklings now with a quicker note of jubilance almost of triumph we watched beside her throughout the night the sounds from nan tauach continued until about an hour before moon set in the morning thora awoke none the worse apparently she had had bad dreams she said she could not remember what they were except that they had warned her of danger she was oddly sullen and throughout the morning her gaze returned again and again half fascinatedly half wonderingly to the neighbouring isle that afternoon the natives returned and that night on nan tauach the silence was unbroken nor were there lights nor sign of life you will understand goodwin how the occurrences i have related would excite the scientific curiosity we rejected immediately of course any explanation admitting the supernatural our symptoms let me call them could all very easily be accounted for it is unquestionable that the vibrations created by certain musical instruments have definite and sometimes extraordinary effect upon the nervous system we accepted this as the explanation of the reactions we had experienced hearing the unfamiliar sounds thora's nervousness her superstitious apprehensions had wrought her up to a condition of semi somnambulistic hysteria science could readily explain her part in the night's scene we came to the conclusion that there must be a passage way between ponape and nan tauach known to the natives and used by them during their rites we decided that on the next departure of our labourers we would set forth immediately to nan tauach we would investigate during the day and at evening my wife and thora would go back to camp leaving stanton and me to spend the night on the island observing from some safe hiding place what might occur the moon waned appeared crescent in the west waxed slowly toward the full before the men left us they literally prayed us to accompany them their importunities only made us more eager to see what it was that we were now convinced they wanted to conceal from us at least that was true of stanton and myself it was not true of edith she was thoughtful abstracted reluctant when the men were out of sight around the turn of the harbour we took our boat and made straight for nan tauach soon its mighty sea wall towered above us we passed through the water gate with its gigantic hewn prisms of basalt and landed beside a half submerged pier in front of us stretched a series of giant steps leading into a vast court strewn with fragments of fallen pillars in the centre of the court beyond the shattered pillars rose another terrace of basalt blocks concealing i knew still another enclosure and now walter for the better understanding of what follows and and he hesitated should you decide later to return with me or if i am taken to to follow us listen carefully to my description of this place nan tauach is literally three rectangles the first rectangle is the sea wall built up of monoliths hewn and squared twenty feet wide at the top to get to the gateway in the sea wall you pass along the canal marked on the map between nan tauach and the islet named tau the entrance to the canal is bidden by dense thickets of mangroves once through these the way is clear the steps lead up from the landing of the sea gate through the entrance to the courtyard this courtyard is surrounded by another basalt wall rectangular following with mathematical exactness the march of the outer barricades the sea wall is from thirty to forty feet high originally it must have been much higher but there has been subsidence in parts the wall of the first enclosure is fifteen feet across the top and its height varies from twenty to fifty feet here too the gradual sinking of the land has caused portions of it to fall within this courtyard is the second enclosure its terrace of the same basalt as the outer walls is about twenty feet high entrance is gained to it by many breaches which time has made in its stonework this is the inner court the heart of nan tauach there lies the great central vault with which is associated the one name of living being that has come to us out of the mists of the past the natives say it was the treasure house of chau te leur a mighty king who reigned long before their fathers as chan is the ancient ponapean word both for sun and king the name means without doubt place of the sun king it is a memory of a dynastic name of the race that ruled the pacific continent now vanished just as the rulers of ancient crete took the name of minos and the rulers of egypt the name of pharaoh and opposite this place of the sun king is the moon rock that hides the moon pool it was stanton who discovered the moon rock we had been inspecting the inner courtyard edith and thora were getting together our lunch i came out of the vault of chau te leur to find stanton before a part of the terrace studying it wonderingly what do you make of this he asked me as i came up he pointed to the wall i followed his finger and saw a slab of stone about fifteen feet high and ten wide at first all i noticed was the exquisite nicety with which its edges joined the blocks about it then i realized that its colour was subtly different tinged with grey and of a smooth peculiar deadness looks more like calcite than basalt i said i touched it and withdrew my hand quickly for at the contact every nerve in my arm tingled as though a shock of frozen electricity had passed through it it was not cold as we know cold it was a chill force the phrase i have used frozen electricity describes it better than anything else stanton looked at me oddly so you felt it too he said i was wondering whether i was developing hallucinations like thora notice by the way that the blocks beside it are quite warm beneath the sun we examined the slab eagerly its edges were cut as though by an engraver of jewels they fitted against the neighbouring blocks in almost a hair line its base was slightly curved and fitted as closely as top and sides upon the huge stones on which it rested and then we noted that these stones had been hollowed to follow the line of the grey stone's foot there was a semicircular depression running from one side of the slab to the other it was as though the grey rock stood in the centre of a shallow cup revealing half covering half something about this hollow attracted me i reached down and felt it goodwin although the balance of the stones that formed it like all the stones of the courtyard were rough and age worn this was as smooth as even surfaced as though it had just left the hands of the polisher it's a door exclaimed stanton it swings around in that little cup that's what makes the hollow so smooth maybe you're right i replied but how the devil can we open it we went over the slab again pressing upon its edges thrusting against its sides during one of those efforts i happened to look up and cried out a foot above and on each side of the corner of the grey rock's lintel was a slight convexity visible only from the angle at which my gaze struck it we carried with us a small scaling ladder and up this i went the bosses were apparently nothing more than chiseled curvatures in the stone i laid my hand on the one i was examining and drew it back sharply in my palm at the base of my thumb i had felt the same shock that i had in touching the slab below i put my hand back the impression came from a spot not more than an inch wide i went carefully over the entire convexity and six times more the chill ran through my arm there were seven circles an inch wide in the curved place each of which communicated the precise sensation i have described the convexity on the opposite side of the slab gave exactly the same results but no amount of touching or of pressing these spots singly or in any combination gave the slightest promise of motion to the slab itself and yet they're what open it said stanton positively why do you say that i asked i don't know he answered hesitatingly but something tells me so throck he went on half earnestly half laughingly the purely scientific part of me is fighting the purely human part of me the scientific part is urging me to find some way to get that slab either down or open the human part is just as strongly urging me to do nothing of the sort and get away while i can he laughed again shamefacedly which shall it be he asked and i thought that in his tone the human side of him was ascendant it will probably stay as it is unless we blow it to bits i said i thought of that he answered and i wouldn't dare he added soberly enough and even as i had spoken there came to me the same feeling that he had expressed it was as though something passed out of the grey rock that struck my heart as a hand strikes an impious lip we turned away uneasily and faced thora coming through a breach on the terrace miss edith wants you quick she began and stopped her eyes went past me to the grey rock her body grew rigid she took a few stiff steps forward and then ran straight to it she cast herself upon its breast hands and face pressed against it we heard her scream as though her very soul were being drawn from her and watched her fall at its foot as we picked her up i saw steal from her face the look i had observed when first we heard the crystal music of nan tauach that unhuman mingling of opposites chapter iv the first vanishings we carried thora back down to where edith was waiting we told her what had happened and what we had found she listened gravely and as we finished thora sighed and opened her eyes i would like to see the stone she said charles you stay here with thora we passed through the outer court silently and stood before the rock she touched it drew back her hand as i had thrust it forward again resolutely and held it there she seemed to be listening then she turned to me david said my wife and the wistfulness in her voice hurt me david would you be very very disappointed if we went from here without trying to find out any more about it would you walter i never wanted anything so much in my life as i wanted to learn what that rock concealed nevertheless i tried to master my desire and i answered edith not a bit if you want us to do it she read my struggle in my eyes she turned back toward the grey rock i saw a shiver pass through her i felt a tinge of remorse and pity edith i exclaimed we'll go she looked at me again science is a jealous mistress she quoted no after all it may be just fancy at any rate you can't run away no but dave i'm going to stay too and there was no changing her decision as we neared the others she laid a hand on my arm dave she said if there should be something well inexplicable tonight something that seems too dangerous will you promise to go back to our own islet tomorrow if we can and wait until the natives return i promised eagerly the desire to stay and see what came with the night was like a fire within me we picked a place about five hundred feet away from the steps leading into the outer court the spot we had selected was well hidden we could not be seen and yet we had a clear view of the stairs and the gateway we settled down just before dusk to wait for whatever might come i was nearest the giant steps next me edith then thora and last stanton night fell after a time the eastern sky began to lighten and we knew that the moon was rising grew lighter still and the orb peeped over the sea swam into full sight i glanced at edith and then at thora my wife was intently listening thora sat as she had since we had placed ourselves elbows on knees her hands covering her face and then from the moonlight flooding us there dripped down on me a great drowsiness sleep seemed to seep from the rays and fall upon my eyes closing them closing them inexorably edith's hand in mine relaxed stanton's head fell upon his breast and his body swayed drunkenly i tried to rise to fight against the profound desire for slumber that pressed on me and as i fought thora raised her head as though listening and turned toward the gateway there was infinite despair in her face and expectancy i tried again to rise and a surge of sleep rushed over me dimly as i sank within it i heard a crystalline chiming raised my lids once more with a supreme effort thora bathed in light was standing at the top of the stairs sleep took me for its very own swept me into the heart of oblivion dawn was breaking when i wakened recollection rushed back i thrust a panic stricken hand out toward edith touched her and my heart gave a great leap of thankfulness she stirred sat up rubbing dazed eyes stanton lay on his side back toward us head in arms edith looked at me laughingly heavens what sleep she said memory came to her what happened she whispered what made us sleep like that stanton awoke what's the matter he exclaimed you look as though you've been seeing ghosts edith caught my hands where's thora she cried before i could answer she had run out into the open calling thora was taken was all i could say to stanton together we went to my wife now standing beside the great stone steps looking up fearfully at the gateway into the terraces there i told them what i had seen before sleep had drowned me and together then we ran up the stairs through the court and to the grey rock the slab was closed as it had been the day before nor was there trace of its having opened no trace even as i thought this edith dropped to her knees before it and reached toward something lying at its foot it was a little piece of gay silk i knew it for part of the kerchief thora wore about her hair she lifted the fragment it had been cut from the kerchief as though by a razor edge a few threads ran from it down toward the base of the slab ran on to the base of the grey rock and under it the grey rock was a door and it had opened and thora had passed through it i think that for the next few minutes we all were a little insane we beat upon that portal with our hands with stones and sticks at last reason came back to us goodwin during the next two hours we tried every way in our power to force entrance through the slab the rock resisted our drills we tried explosions at the base with charges covered by rock they made not the slightest impression on the surface expending their force of course upon the slighter resistance of their coverings afternoon found us hopeless night was coming on and we would have to decide our course of action i wanted to go to ponape for help but edith objected that this would take hours and after we had reached there it would be impossible to persuade our men to return with us that night if at all what then was left clearly only one of two choices to go back to our camp wait for our men and on their return try to persuade them to go with us to nan tauach but this would mean the abandonment of thora for at least two days we could not do it it would have been too cowardly the other choice was to wait where we were for night to come to wait for the rock to open as it had the night before and to make a sortie through it for thora before it could close again our path lay clear before us we had to spend that night on nan tauach we had of course discussed the sleep phenomena very fully if our theory that lights sounds and thora's disappearance were linked with secret religious rites of the natives the logical inference was that the slumber had been produced by them perhaps by vapours you know as well as i what extraordinary knowledge these pacific peoples have of such things or the sleep might have been simply a coincidence and produced by emanations either gaseous or from plants natural causes which had happened to coincide in their effects with the other manifestations we made some rough and ready but effective respirators as dusk fell we looked over our weapons edith was an excellent shot with both rifle and pistol we had decided that my wife was to remain in the hiding place stanton would take up a station on the far side of the stairway and i would place myself opposite him on the side near edith the place i picked out was less than two hundred feet from her and i could reassure myself now and then as to her safety as it looked down upon the hollow wherein she crouched from our respective stations stanton and i could command the gateway entrance his position gave him also a glimpse of the outer courtyard a faint glow in the sky heralded the moon stanton and i took our places the moon dawn increased rapidly the disk swam up and in a moment it was shining in full radiance upon ruins and sea as it rose there came a curious little sighing sound from the inner terrace stanton straightened up and stared intently through the gateway rifle ready stanton what do you see i called cautiously he waved a silencing hand i turned my head to look at edith a shock ran through me she lay upon her side her face grotesque with its nose and mouth covered by the respirator was turned full toward the moon she was again in deepest sleep as i turned again to call to stanton my eyes swept the head of the steps and stopped fascinated for the moonlight had thickened it seemed to be curdled there and through it ran little gleams and veins of shimmering white fire a languor passed through me it was not the ineffable drowsiness of the preceding night it was a sapping of all will to move i tried to cry out to stanton i had not even the will to move my lips goodwin i could not even move my eyes stanton was in the range of my fixed vision i watched him leap up the steps and move toward the gateway the curdled radiance seemed to await him he stepped into it and was lost to my sight for a dozen heart beats there was silence then a rain of tinklings that set the pulses racing with joy and at once checked them with tiny fingers of ice and ringing through them stanton's voice from the courtyard a great cry a scream filled with ecstasy insupportable and horror unimaginable and once more there was silence i strove to burst the bonds that held me i could not even my eyelids were fixed within them my eyes dry and aching burned then goodwin i first saw the inexplicable the crystalline music swelled where i sat i could take in the gateway and its basalt portals rough and broken rising to the top of the wall forty feet above shattered ruined portals unclimbable from this gateway an intenser light began to flow it grew it gushed and out of it walked stanton stanton but god what a vision a deep tremor shook him i waited waited chapter v into the moon pool goodwin throckmartin went on at last i can describe him only as a thing of living light he radiated light was filled with light overflowed with it a shining cloud whirled through and around him in radiant swirls shimmering tentacles luminescent coruscating spirals his face shone with a rapture too great to be borne by living man and was shadowed with insuperable misery it was as though it had been remoulded by the hand of god and the hand of satan working together and in harmony you have seen that seal upon my own but you have never seen it in the degree that stanton bore it the eyes were wide open and fixed as though upon some inward vision of hell and heaven the light that filled and surrounded him had a nucleus a core something shiftingly human shaped that dissolved and changed gathered itself whirled through and beyond him and back again and as its shining nucleus passed through him stanton's whole body pulsed radiance as the luminescence moved there moved above it still and serene always seven tiny globes of seven colors like seven little moons then swiftly stanton was lifted levitated up the unscalable wall and to its top the glow faded from the moonlight the tinkling music grew fainter i tried again to move the tears were running down now from my rigid lids and they brought relief to my tortured eyes i have said my gaze was fixed it was but from the side peripherally it took in a part of the far wall of the outer enclosure ages seemed to pass and a radiance stole along it soon drifted into sight the figure that was stanton far away he was on the gigantic wall but still i could see the shining spirals whirling jubilantly around and through him felt rather than saw his tranced face beneath the seven moons a swirl of crystal notes and he had passed and all the time as though from some opened well of light the courtyard gleamed and sent out silver fires that dimmed the moonrays yet seemed strangely to be a part of them at last the moon neared the horizon there came a louder burst of sound the second and last cry of stanton like an echo of his first again the soft sighing from the inner terrace then utter silence the light faded the moon was setting and with a rush life and power to move returned to me i made a leap for the steps rushed up them through the gateway and straight to the grey rock it was closed as i knew it would be but did i dream it or did i hear echoing through it as though from vast distances a triumphant shouting i ran back to edith at my touch she wakened looked at me wanderingly raised herself on a hand dave she said i slept after all she saw the despair on my face and leaped to her feet dave she cried what is it where's charles i lighted a fire before i spoke then i told her and for the balance of that night we sat before the flames arms around each other like two frightened children abruptly throckmartin held his hands out to me appealingly walter old friend he cried don't look at me as though i were mad it's truth absolute truth wait i comforted him as well as i could after a little time he took up his story never he said did man welcome the sun as we did that morning a soon as it had risen we went back to the courtyard the walls whereon i had seen stanton were black and silent the terraces were as they had been the grey slab was in its place in the shallow hollow at its base was nothing nothing nothing was there anywhere on the islet of stanton not a trace what were we to do precisely the same arguments that had kept us there the night before held good now and doubly good we could not abandon these two could not go as long as there was the faintest hope of finding them and yet for love of each other how could we remain i loved my wife how much i never knew until that day and she loved me as deeply it takes only one each night she pleaded beloved let it take me i wept walter we both wept we will meet it together she said and it was thus at last that we arranged it that took great courage indeed throckmartin i interrupted he looked at me eagerly you do believe then he exclaimed i believe i said he pressed my hand with a grip that nearly crushed it now he told me i do not fear if i fail you will follow with help i promised we talked it over carefully he went on bringing to bear all our power of analysis and habit of calm scientific thought we considered minutely the time element in the phenomena although the deep chanting began at the very moment of moonrise fully five minutes had passed between its full lifting and the strange sighing sound from the inner terrace i went back in memory over the happenings of the night before at least ten minutes had intervened between the first heralding sigh and the intensification of the moonlight in the courtyard and this glow grew for at least ten minutes more before the first burst of the crystal notes indeed more than half an hour must have elapsed i calculated between the moment the moon showed above the horizon and the first delicate onslaught of the tinklings edith i cried i think i have it the grey rock opens five minutes after upon the moonrise but whoever or whatever it is that comes through it must wait until the moon has risen higher or else it must come from a distance the thing to do is not to wait for it but to surprise it before it passes out the door we will go into the inner court early you will take your rifle and pistol and hide yourself where you can command the opening if the slab does open the instant it opens i will enter it's our best chance edith i think it's our only one my wife demurred strongly she wanted to go with me but i convinced her that it was better for her to stand guard without prepared to help me if i were forced again into the open by what lay behind the rock at the half hour before moonrise we went into the inner court i took my place at the side of the grey rock edith crouched behind a broken pillar twenty feet away slipped her rifle barrel over it so that it would cover the opening the minutes crept by the darkness lessened and through the breaches of the terrace i watched the far sky softly lighten"
