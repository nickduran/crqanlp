"1" "of the cause but this business of the bagpipes touched the comic to harry an old valet out of bed and set him droning on pipes in the small hours smacked of a theatrical taste or at least of an undignified fancy kings in exile if they wish to keep the tragic air should not indulge in such fantastic serenades my mind changed again when after breakfast i fell in with madame on the stair she drew aside to let me pass and then made as if she would speak to me i gave her good morning and my mind being full of her story addressed her as excellency i see sir she said that you know the truth i have to ask your forbearance for the concealment i practised yesterday it was a poor requital for your generosity but is it one of the shifts of our sad fortune an uncrowned king must go in disguise or risk the laughter of every stable boy besides we are too poor to travel in state even if we desired it honestly i knew not what to say i was not asked to sympathise having already revealed my politics and yet the case cried out for sympathy you remember my dear aunt the good lady culham who was our dorsetshire neighbour and tried hard to mend my ways at carteron this poor duchess for so she called herself was just such another a woman made for comfort housewifery and motherhood and by no means for racing about europe in charge of a disreputable parent i could picture her settled equably on a garden seat with a lapdog and needlework blinking happily over green lawns and mildly rating an errant gardener i could fancy her sitting in a summer parlour very orderly and dainty writing lengthy epistles to a tribe of nieces i could see her marshalling a household in the family pew or riding serenely in the family coach behind fat bay horses but here on an inn staircase with a false name and a sad air of mystery she was woefully out of place i noted little wrinkles forming in the corners of her eyes and the ravages of care beginning in the plump rosiness of her face be sure there was nothing appealing in her mien she spoke with the air of a great lady to whom the world is matter only for an afterthought it was the facts that appealed and grew poignant from her courage there is another claim upon your good nature she said doubtless you were awoke last night by oliphant's playing upon the pipes i rebuked the landlord for his insolence in protesting but to you a gentleman and a friend an explanation is due my father sleeps ill and your conversation seems to have cast him into a train of sad memories it has been his habit on such occasions to have the pipes played to him since they remind him of friends and happier days it is a small privilege for an old man and he does not claim it often i declared that the music had only pleased and that i would welcome its repetition where upon she left me with a little bow and an invitation to join them that day at dinner while i departed into the town on my own errands i returned before midday and was seated at an arbour in the garden busy with letters when there hove in sight the gaunt figure of oliphant he hovered around me if such a figure can be said to hover with the obvious intention of addressing me the fellow had caught my fancy and i was willing to see more of him his face might have been hacked out of grey granite his clothes hung loosely on his spare bones and his stockined shanks would have done no discredit to don quixote there was no dignity in his air only a steady and enduring sadness here thought i is the one of the establishment who most commonly meets the shock of the world's buffets i called him by name and asked him his desires it appeared that he took me for a jacobite for he began a rigmarole about loyalty and hard fortune i hastened to correct him and he took the correction with the same patient despair with which he took all things twas but another of the blows of fate at any rate he said in a broad scotch accent ye come of kin that has helpit my maister afore this i've many times heard tell o herveys and townshends in england and a folk said they were on the richt side ye're maybe no a freend but ye're a freend's freend or i wadna be speirin at ye i was amused at the prologue and waited on the tale it soon came oliphant it appeared was the purse bearer of the household and woeful straits that poor purse bearer must have been often put to i questioned him as to his master's revenues but could get no clear answer there were payments due next month in florence which would solve the difficulties for the winter but in the meantime expenditure had beaten income travelling had cost much and the count must have his small comforts the result in plain words was that oliphant had not the wherewithal to frank the company to florence indeed i doubted if he could have paid the reckoning in santa chiara a loan was therefore sought from a friend's friend meaning myself i was very really embarrassed not that i would not have given willingly for i had ample resources at the moment and was mightily concerned about the sad household but i knew that the little duchess would take oliphant's ears from his head if she guessed that he had dared to borrow from me and that if i lent her back would for ever be turned against me and yet what would follow on my refusal in a day of two there would be a pitiful scene with mine host and as like as not some of their baggage detained as security for payment i did not love the task of conspiring behind the lady's back but if it could be contrived twas indubitably the kindest course i glared sternly at oliphant who met me with his pathetic dog like eyes you know that your mistress would never consent to the request you have made of me i ken he said humbly but payin is my job and i simply havena the siller it's no the first time it has happened and it's a sair trial for them both to be flung out o doors by a foreign hostler because they canna meet his charges but sir if ye can lend to me ye may be certain that her leddyship will never hear a word o't puir thing she takes nae thocht o where the siller comes frae ony mair than the lilies o the field i became a conspirator you swear oliphant by all you hold sacred to breathe nothing of this to your mistress and if she should suspect to lie like a privy councillor a flicker of a smile crossed his face i'll lee like a scotch packman and the father o lees could do nae mair you need have no fear for your siller sir i've aye repaid when i borrowed though you may have to wait a bittock and the strange fellow strolled off at dinner no duchess appeared till long after the appointed hour nor was there any sign of oliphant when she came at last with cristine her eyes looked as if she had been crying and she greeted me with remote courtesy my first thought was that oliphant had revealed the matter of the loan but presently i found that the lady's trouble was far different her father it seemed was ill again with his old complaint what that was i did not ask nor did the duchess reveal it we spoke in french for i had discovered that this was her favourite speech there was no oliphant to wait on us and the inn servants were always about so it was well to have a tongue they did not comprehend the lady was distracted and sad when i inquired feelingly as to the general condition of her father's health she parried the question and when i offered my services she disregarded my words it was in truth a doleful meal while the faded cristine sat like a sphinx staring into vacancy i spoke of england and of her friends of paris and versailles of avignon where she had spent some years and of the amenities of florence which she considered her home but it was like talking to a nunnery door i got nothing but it is indeed true sir or do you say so sir till my energy began to sink madame perceived my discomfort and as she rose murmured an apology pray forgive my distraction but i am poor company when my father is ill i have a foolish mind easily frightened nay nay she went on when i again offered help the illness is trifling it will pass off by to morrow or at the latest the next day only i had looked forward to some ease at santa chiara and the promise is belied as it chanced that evening returning to the inn i passed by the north side where the windows of the count's room looked over a little flower garden abutting on the courtyard the dusk was falling and a lamp had been lit which gave a glimpse into the interior the sick man was standing by the window his figure flung into relief by the lamplight if he was sick his sickness was of a curious type his face was ruddy his eye wild and his wig being off his scanty hair stood up oddly round his head he seemed to be singing but i could not catch the sound through the shut casement another figure in the room probably oliphant laid a hand on the count's shoulder drew him from the window and closed the shutter it needed only the recollection of stories which were the property of all europe to reach a conclusion on the gentleman's illness the legitimate king of england was very drunk as i went to my room that night i passed the count's door there stood oliphant as sentry more grim and haggard than ever and i thought that his eye met mine with a certain intelligence from inside the room came a great racket there was the sound of glasses falling then a string of oaths english french and for all i know irish rapped out in a loud drunken voice a pause and then came the sound of maudlin singing it pursued me along the gallery an old childish song delivered as if twere a pot house catch qu'est ce qui passe ici si tard compagnons de la marjolaine one of the late going company of the marjolaine hastened to bed this king in exile with his melancholy daughter was becoming too much for him iii it was just before noon next day that the travellers arrived i was sitting in the shady loggia of the inn reading a volume of de thou when there drove up to the door two coaches out of the first descended very slowly and stiffly four gentlemen out of the second four servants and a quantity of baggage as it chanced there was no one about the courtyard slept its sunny noontide sleep and the only movement was a lizard on the wall and a buzz of flies by the fountain seeing no sign of the landlord one of the travellers approached me with a grave inclination this is the inn called the tre croci sir he asked i said it was and shouted on my own account for the host presently that personage arrived with a red face and a short wind having ascended rapidly from his own cellar he was awed by the dignity of the travellers and made none of his usual protests of incapacity the servants filed off solemnly with the baggage and the four gentlemen set themselves down beside me in the loggia and ordered each a modest flask of wine at first i took them for our countrymen but as i watched them the conviction vanished all four were tall and lean beyond the average of mankind they wore suits of black with antique starched frills to their shirts their hair was their own and unpowdered massive buckles of an ancient pattern adorned their square toed shoes and the canes they carried were like the yards of a small vessel they were four merchants i had guessed of scotland maybe or of newcastle but their voices were not scotch and their air had no touch of commerce take the heavy browed preoccupation of a secretary of state add the dignity of a bishop the sunburn of a fox hunter and something of the disciplined erectness of a soldier and you may perceive the manner of these four gentlemen by the side of them my assurance vanished compared with their olympian serenity my person seemed fussy and servile even so i mused must mr franklin have looked when baited in parliament by the tory pack the reflection gave me the cue presently i caught from their conversation the word washington and the truth flashed upon me i was in the presence of four of mr franklin's countrymen having never seen an american in the flesh i rejoiced at the chance of enlarging my acquaintance they brought me into the circle by a polite question as to the length of road to verona soon introductions followed my name intrigued them and they were eager to learn of my kinship to uncle charles the eldest of the four it appeared was mr galloway out of maryland then came two brothers sylvester by name of pennsylvania and last mr fish a lawyer of new york all four had campaigned in the late war and all four were members of the convention or whatever they call their rough and ready parliament they were modest in their behaviour much disinclined to speak of their past as great men might be whose reputation was world wide somehow the names stuck in my memory i was certain that i had heard them linked with some stalwart fight or some moving civil deed or some defiant manifesto the making of history was in their steadfast eye and the grave lines of the mouth our friendship flourished mightily in a brief hour and brought me the invitation willingly accepted to sit with them at dinner there was no sign of the duchess or cristine or oliphant whatever had happened that household to day required all hands on deck and i was left alone with the americans in my day i have supped with the macaronies i have held up my head at the cocoa tree i have avoided the floor at hunt dinners i have drunk glass to glass with tom carteron but never before have i seen such noble consumers of good liquor as those four gentlemen from beyond the atlantic they drank the strong red cyprus as if it had been spring water the dust of your italian roads takes some cleansing mr townshend was their only excuse but in truth none was needed the wine seemed only to thaw their iron decorum without any surcease of dignity they grew communicative and passed from lands to peoples and from peoples to constitutions before we knew it we were embarked upon high politics naturally we did not differ on the war like me they held it to have been a grievous necessity they had no bitterness against england only regrets for her blunders of his majesty they spoke with respect of his majesty's advisers with dignified condemnation they thought highly of our troops in america less highly of our generals look you sir said mr galloway in a war such as we have witnessed the almighty is the only strategist you fight against the forces of nature and a newcomer little knows that the success or failure of every operation he can conceive depends not upon generalship but upon the confirmation of a vast country our generals with this in mind and with fewer men could make all your schemes miscarry had the english soldiers not been of such stubborn stuff we should have been victors from the first our leader was not general washington but general america and his brigadiers were forests swamps lakes rivers and high mountains and now i said having won you have the greatest of human experiments before you your business is to show that the saxon stock is adaptable to a republic it seemed to me that they exchanged glances we are not pedants said mr fish and have no desire to dispute about the form of a constitution a people may be as free under a king as under a senate liberty is not the lackey of any type of government these were strange words from a member of a race whom i had thought wedded to the republicanism of helvidius priscus as a loyal subject of a monarchy i said i must agree with you but your hands are tied for i cannot picture the establishment of a house of washington and if not where are you to turn for your sovereign again a smile seemed to pass among the four we are experimenters as you say sir and must go slowly in the meantime we have an authority which keeps peace and property safe we are at leisure to cast our eyes round and meditate on the future then gentlemen said i you take an excellent way of meditation in visiting this museum of old sovereignties here you have the relics of any government you please a dozen republics tyrannies theocracies merchant confederations kingdoms and more than one empire you have your choice i am tolerably familiar with the land and if i can assist you i am at your service they thanked me gravely we have letters said mr galloway one in especial is to a gentleman whom we hope to meet in this place have you heard in your travels of the count of albany he has arrived said i two days ago even now he is in the chamber above us at dinner the news interested them hugely you have seen him they cried what is he like an elderly gentleman in poor health a man who has travelled much and i judge has suffered something from fortune he has a fondness for the english so you will be welcome sirs but he was indisposed yesterday and may still be unable to receive you his daughter travels with him and tends his old age and you you have spoken with him the night before last i was in his company we talked of many things including the late war he is somewhat of your opinion on matters of government the four looked at each other and then mr galloway rose i ask your permission mr townshend to consult for a moment with my friends the matter is of some importance and i would beg you to await us so saying he led the others out of doors and i heard them withdraw to a corner of the loggia now thought i there is something afoot and my long sought romance approaches fruition the company of the marjolaine whom the count had sung of have arrived at last presently they returned and seated themselves at the table you can be of great assistance to us mr townshend and we would fain take you into our confidence are you aware who is this count of albany i nodded it is a thin disguise to one familiar with history have you reached any estimate of his character or capabilities you speak to friends and let me tell you it is a matter which deeply concerns the count's interests i think him a kindly and pathetic old gentleman he naturally bears the mark of forty years sojourn in the wilderness mr galloway took snuff we have business with him but it is business which stands in need of an agent there is no one in the count's suite with whom we could discuss affairs there is his daughter ah but she would scarcely suit the case is there no man a friend and yet not a member of the family who can treat with us i replied that i thought that i was the only being in santa chiara who answered the description if you will accept the task mr townshend you are amply qualified we will be frank with you and reveal our business we are on no less an errand than to offer the count of albany a crown i suppose i must have had some suspicion of their purpose and yet the revelation of it fell on me like a thunderclap i could only stare owlishly at my four grave gentlemen mr galloway went on unperturbed i have told you that in america we are not yet republicans there are those among us who favour a republic but they are by no means a majority we have got rid of a king who misgoverned us but we have no wish to get rid of kingship we want a king of our own choosing and we would get with him all the ancient sanctions of monarchy the count of albany is of the most illustrious royal stock in europe he is if legitimacy goes for anything the rightful king of britain now if the republican party among us is to be worsted we must come before the nation with a powerful candidate for their favour you perceive my drift what more potent appeal to american pride than to say we have got rid of king george we choose of our own free will the older line and king charles i said foolishly that i thought monarchy had had its day and that twas idle to revive it that is a sentiment well enough under a monarchical government but we with a clean page to write upon do not share it you know your ancient historians has not the repository of the chief power always been the rock on which republicanism has shipwrecked if that power is given to the chief citizen the way is prepared for the tyrant if it abides peacefully in a royal house it abides with cyphers who dignify without obstructing a popular constitution do not mistake me mr townshend this is no whim of a sentimental girl but the reasoned conclusion of the men who achieved our liberty there is every reason to believe that general washington shares our views and mr hamilton whose name you may know is the inspirer of our mission but the count is an old man i urged for i knew not where to begin in my exposition of the hopelessness of their errand by so much the better we do not wish a young king who may be fractious an old man tempered by misfortune is what our purpose demands he has also his failings a man cannot lead his life for forty years and retain all the virtues at that one of the sylvesters spoke sharply i have heard such gossip but i do not credit it i have not forgotten preston and derby i made my last objection he has no posterity legitimate posterity to carry on his line the four gentlemen smiled that happens to be his chiefest recommendation said mr galloway it enables us to take the house of stuart on trial we need a breathing space and leisure to look around but unless we establish the principle of monarchy at once the republicans will forestall us let us get our king at all costs and during the remaining years of his life we shall have time to settle the succession problem we have no wish to saddle ourselves for good with a race who might prove burdensome if king charles fails he has no son and we can look elsewhere for a better monarch you perceive the reason of my view i did and i also perceived the colossal absurdity of the whole business but i could not convince them of it for they met my objections with excellent arguments nothing save a sight of the count would i feared disillusion them you wish me to make this proposal on your behalf i asked we shall make the proposal ourselves but we desire you to prepare the way for us he is an elderly man and should first be informed of our purpose there is one person whom i beg leave to consult the duchess his daughter it may be that the present is an ill moment for approaching the count and the affair requires her sanction they agreed and with a very perplexed mind i went forth to seek the lady the irony of the thing was too cruel and my heart ached for her in the gallery i found oliphant packing some very shabby trunks and when i questioned him he told me that the family were to leave santa chiara on the morrow perchance the duchess had awakened to the true state of their exchequer or perchance she thought it well to get her father on the road again as a cure for his ailment i discovered cristine and begged for an interview with her mistress on an urgent matter she led me to the duchess's room and there the evidence of poverty greeted me openly all the little luxuries of the menage had gone to the count the poor lady's room was no better than a servant's garret and the lady herself sat stitching a rent in a travelling cloak she rose to greet me with alarm in her eyes as briefly as i could i set out the facts of my amazing mission at first she seemed scarcely to hear me what do they want with him she asked he can give them nothing he is no friend to the americans or to any people who have deposed their sovereign then as she grasped my meaning her face flushed it is a heartless trick mr townshend i would fain think you no party to it believe me dear madame it is no trick the men below are in sober earnest you have but to see their faces to know that theirs is no wild adventure i believe sincerely that they have the power to implement their promise but it is madness he is old and worn and sick his day is long past for winning a crown all this i have said but it does not move them and i told her rapidly mr galloway's argument she fell into a muse at the eleventh hour nay too late too late had he been twenty years younger what a stroke of fortune fate bears too hard on us too hard then she turned to me fiercely you have no doubt heard sir the gossip about my father which is on the lips of every fool in europe let us have done with this pitiful make believe my father is a sot nay i do not blame him i blame his enemies and his miserable destiny but there is the fact were he not old he would still be unfit to grasp a crown and rule over a turbulent people he flees from one city to another but he cannot flee from himself that is his illness on which you condoled with me yesterday the lady's control was at breaking point another moment and i expected a torrent of tears but they did not come with a great effort she regained her composure well the gentlemen must have an answer you will tell them that the count my father nay give him his true title if you care is vastly obliged to them for the honour they have done him but would decline on account of his age and infirmities you know how to phrase a decent refusal pardon me said i but i might give them that answer till doomsday and never content them they have not travelled many thousand miles to be put off by hearsay evidence nothing will satisfy them but an interview with your father himself it is impossible she said sharply then we must expect the renewed attentions of our american friends they will wait till they see him she rose and paced the room they must go she repeated many times if they see him sober he will accept with joy and we shall be the laughing stock of the world i tell you it cannot be i alone know how immense is the impossibility he cannot afford to lose the last rags of his dignity the last dregs of his ease they must not see him i will speak with them myself they will be honoured madame but i do not think they will be convinced they are what we call in my land men of business they will not be content till they get the count's reply from his own lips a new duchess seemed to have arisen a woman of quick action and sharp words so be it they shall see him oh i am sick to death of fine sentiments and high loyalty and all the vapouring stuff i have lived among for years all i ask for myself and my father is a little peace and by heaven i shall secure it if nothing"
