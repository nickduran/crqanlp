"1" "the fourth watch on thursday the 13th of november hannibal routed the advance guard of the romans and led the carthaginian forces over the mountains into the plains of casilinum a cohort of light armed numidians engaged the infantry of quintus fabius maximus two battles and light skirmishing romans repulsed with heavy losses i have the honour of being your special correspondent from the front j abbott ps i know i'm not to expect any letters in return and i've been warned not to bother you with questions but tell me daddy just this once are you awfully old or just a little old and are you perfectly bald or just a little bald it is very difficult thinking about you in the abstract like a theorem in geometry given a tall rich man who hates girls but is very generous to one quite impertinent girl what does he look like r.s.v.p 19th december dear daddy long legs you never answered my question and it was very important are you bald i have it planned exactly what you look like very satisfactorily until i reach the top of your head and then i am stuck i can't decide whether you have white hair or black hair or sort of sprinkly grey hair or maybe none at all here is your portrait but the problem is shall i add some hair would you like to know what colour your eyes are they're grey and your eyebrows stick out like a porch roof beetling they're called in novels and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency to turn down at the corners oh you see i know you're a snappy old thing with a temper chapel bell 9.45 p.m i have a new unbreakable rule never never to study at night no matter how many written reviews are coming in the morning instead i read just plain books i have to you know because there are eighteen blank years behind me you wouldn't believe daddy what an abyss of ignorance my mind is i am just realizing the depths myself the things that most girls with a properly assorted family and a home and friends and a library know by absorption i have never heard of for example i never read mother goose or david copperfield or ivanhoe or cinderella or blue beard or robinson crusoe or jane eyre or alice in wonderland or a word of rudyard kipling i didn't know that henry the eighth was married more than once or that shelley was a poet i didn't know that people used to be monkeys and that the garden of eden was a beautiful myth i didn't know that r l s stood for robert louis stevenson or that george eliot was a lady i had never seen a picture of the mona lisa and it's true but you won't believe it i had never heard of sherlock holmes now i know all of these things and a lot of others besides but you can see how much i need to catch up and oh but it's fun i look forward all day to evening and then i put an engaged on the door and get into my nice red bath robe and furry slippers and pile all the cushions behind me on the couch and light the brass student lamp at my elbow and read and read and read one book isn't enough i have four going at once just now they're tennyson's poems and vanity fair and kipling's plain tales and don't laugh little women i find that i am the only girl in college who wasn't brought up on little women i haven't told anybody though that would stamp me as queer i just quietly went and bought it with 1.12 of my last month's allowance and the next time somebody mentions pickled limes i'll know what she is talking about ten o'clock bell this is a very interrupted letter saturday sir i have the honour to report fresh explorations in the field of geometry on friday last we abandoned our former works in parallelopipeds and proceeded to truncated prisms we are finding the road rough and very uphill sunday the christmas holidays begin next week and the trunks are up the corridors are so filled up that you can hardly get through and everybody is so bubbling over with excitement that studying is getting left out i'm going to have a beautiful time in vacation there's another freshman who lives in texas staying behind and we are planning to take long walks and if there's any ice learn to skate then there is still the whole library to be read and three empty weeks to do it in goodbye daddy i hope that you are feeling as happy as i am yours ever judy ps don't forget to answer my question if you don't want the trouble of writing have your secretary telegraph he can just say mr smith is quite bald or mr smith is not bald or mr smith has white hair and you can deduct the twenty five cents out of my allowance goodbye till january and a merry christmas towards the end of the christmas vacation exact date unknown dear daddy long legs is it snowing where you are all the world that i see from my tower is draped in white and the flakes are coming down as big as pop corns it's late afternoon the sun is just setting a cold yellow colour behind some colder violet hills and i am up in my window seat using the last light to write to you your five gold pieces were a surprise i'm not used to receiving christmas presents you have already given me such lots of things everything i have you know that i don't quite feel that i deserve extras but i like them just the same do you want to know what i bought with my money i a silver watch in a leather case to wear on my wrist and get me to recitations in time ii matthew arnold's poems iii a hot water bottle iv a steamer rug my tower is cold v five hundred sheets of yellow manuscript paper i'm going to commence being an author pretty soon vi a dictionary of synonyms to enlarge the author's vocabulary vii i don't much like to confess this last item but i will a pair of silk stockings and now daddy never say i don't tell all it was a very low motive if you must know it that prompted the silk stockings julia pendleton comes into my room to do geometry and she sits cross legged on the couch and wears silk stockings every night but just wait as soon as she gets back from vacation i shall go in and sit on her couch in my silk stockings you see daddy the miserable creature that i am but at least i'm honest and you knew already from my asylum record that i wasn't perfect didn't you to recapitulate that's the way the english instructor begins every other sentence i am very much obliged for my seven presents i'm pretending to myself that they came in a box from my family in california the watch is from father the rug from mother the hot water bottle from grandmother who is always worrying for fear i shall catch cold in this climate and the yellow paper from my little brother harry my sister isabel gave me the silk stockings and aunt susan the matthew arnold poems uncle harry little harry is named after him gave me the dictionary he wanted to send chocolates but i insisted on synonyms you don't object do you to playing the part of a composite family and now shall i tell you about my vacation or are you only interested in my education as such i hope you appreciate the delicate shade of meaning in as such it is the latest addition to my vocabulary the girl from texas is named leonora fenton almost as funny as jerusha isn't it i like her but not so much as sallie mcbride i shall never like any one so much as sallie except you i must always like you the best of all because you're my whole family rolled into one leonora and i and two sophomores have walked cross country every pleasant day and explored the whole neighbourhood dressed in short skirts and knit jackets and caps and carrying shiny sticks to whack things with once we walked into town four miles and stopped at a restaurant where the college girls go for dinner broiled lobster 35 cents and for dessert buckwheat cakes and maple syrup 15 cents nourishing and cheap it was such a lark especially for me because it was so awfully different from the asylum i feel like an escaped convict every time i leave the campus before i thought i started to tell the others what an experience i was having the cat was almost out of the bag when i grabbed it by its tail and pulled it back it's awfully hard for me not to tell everything i know i'm a very confiding soul by nature if i didn't have you to tell things to i'd burst we had a molasses candy pull last friday evening given by the house matron of fergussen to the left behinds in the other halls there were twenty two of us altogether freshmen and sophomores and juniors and seniors all united in amicable accord the kitchen is huge with copper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wall the littlest casserole among them about the size of a wash boiler four hundred girls live in fergussen the chef in a white cap and apron fetched out twenty two other white caps and aprons i can't imagine where he got so many and we all turned ourselves into cooks it was great fun though i have seen better candy when it was finally finished and ourselves and the kitchen and the door knobs all thoroughly sticky we organized a procession and still in our caps and aprons each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan we marched through the empty corridors to the officers parlour where half a dozen professors and instructors were passing a tranquil evening we serenaded them with college songs and offered refreshments they accepted politely but dubiously we left them sucking chunks of molasses candy sticky and speechless so you see daddy my education progresses don't you really think that i ought to be an artist instead of an author vacation will be over in two days and i shall be glad to see the girls again my tower is just a trifle lonely when nine people occupy a house that was built for four hundred they do rattle around a bit eleven pages poor daddy you must be tired i meant this to be just a short little thank you note but when i get started i seem to have a ready pen goodbye and thank you for thinking of me i should be perfectly happy except for one little threatening cloud on the horizon examinations come in february yours with love judy ps maybe it isn't proper to send love if it isn't please excuse but i must love somebody and there's only you and mrs lippett to choose between so you see you'll have to put up with it daddy dear because i can't love her on the eve dear daddy long legs you should see the way this college is studying we've forgotten we ever had a vacation fifty seven irregular verbs have i introduced to my brain in the past four days i'm only hoping they'll stay till after examinations some of the girls sell their text books when they're through with them but i intend to keep mine then after i've graduated i shall have my whole education in a row in the bookcase and when i need to use any detail i can turn to it without the slightest hesitation so much easier and more accurate than trying to keep it in your head julia pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call and stayed a solid hour she got started on the subject of family and i couldn't switch her off she wanted to know what my mother's maiden name was did you ever hear such an impertinent question to ask of a person from a foundling asylum i didn't have the courage to say i didn't know so i just miserably plumped on the first name i could think of and that was montgomery then she wanted to know whether i belonged to the massachusetts montgomerys or the virginia montgomerys her mother was a rutherford the family came over in the ark and were connected by marriage with henry the viii on her father's side they date back further than adam on the topmost branches of her family tree there's a superior breed of monkeys with very fine silky hair and extra long tails i meant to write you a nice cheerful entertaining letter tonight but i'm too sleepy and scared the freshman's lot is not a happy one yours about to be examined judy abbott sunday dearest daddy long legs i have some awful awful awful news to tell you but i won't begin with it i'll try to get you in a good humour first jerusha abbott has commenced to be an author a poem entitled from my tower appears in the february monthly on the first page which is a very great honour for a freshman my english instructor stopped me on the way out from chapel last night and said it was a charming piece of work except for the sixth line which had too many feet i will send you a copy in case you care to read it let me see if i can't think of something else pleasant oh yes i'm learning to skate and can glide about quite respectably all by myself also i've learned how to slide down a rope from the roof of the gymnasium and i can vault a bar three feet and six inches high i hope shortly to pull up to four feet we had a very inspiring sermon this morning preached by the bishop of alabama his text was judge not that ye be not judged it was about the necessity of overlooking mistakes in others and not discouraging people by harsh judgments i wish you might have heard it this is the sunniest most blinding winter afternoon with icicles dripping from the fir trees and all the world bending under a weight of snow except me and i'm bending under a weight of sorrow now for the news courage judy you must tell are you surely in a good humour i failed in mathematics and latin prose i am tutoring in them and will take another examination next month i'm sorry if you're disappointed but otherwise i don't care a bit because i've learned such a lot of things not mentioned in the catalogue i've read seventeen novels and bushels of poetry really necessary novels like vanity fair and richard feverel and alice in wonderland also emerson's essays and lockhart's life of scott and the first volume of gibbon's roman empire and half of benvenuto cellini's life wasn't he entertaining he used to saunter out and casually kill a man before breakfast so you see daddy i'm much more intelligent than if i'd just stuck to latin will you forgive me this once if i promise never to fail again yours in sackcloth judy dear daddy long legs this is an extra letter in the middle of the month because i'm rather lonely tonight it's awfully stormy all the lights are out on the campus but i drank black coffee and i can't go to sleep i had a supper party this evening consisting of sallie and julia and leonora fenton and sardines and toasted muffins and salad and fudge and coffee julia said she'd had a good time but sallie stayed to help wash the dishes i might very usefully put some time on latin tonight but there's no doubt about it i'm a very languid latin scholar we've finished livy and de senectute and are now engaged with de amicitia pronounced damn icitia should you mind just for a little while pretending you are my grandmother sallie has one and julia and leonora each two and they were all comparing them tonight i can't think of anything i'd rather have it's such a respectable relationship so if you really don't object when i went into town yesterday i saw the sweetest cap of cluny lace trimmed with lavender ribbon i am going to make you a present of it on your eighty third birthday that's the clock in the chapel tower striking twelve i believe i am sleepy after all good night granny i love you dearly judy the ides of march dear d l l i am studying latin prose composition i have been studying it i shall be studying it i shall be about to have been studying it my re examination comes the 7th hour next tuesday and i am going to pass or bust so you may expect to hear from me next whole and happy and free from conditions or in fragments i will write a respectable letter when it's over tonight i have a pressing engagement with the ablative absolute yours in evident haste j a 26th march mr d l l smith sir you never answer any questions you never show the slightest interest in anything i do you are probably the horridest one of all those horrid trustees and the reason you are educating me is not because you care a bit about me but from a sense of duty i don't know a single thing about you i don't even know your name it is very uninspiring writing to a thing i haven't a doubt but that you throw my letters into the waste basket without reading them hereafter i shall write only about work my re examinations in latin and geometry came last week i passed them both and am now free from conditions yours truly jerusha abbott 2nd april dear daddy long legs i am a beast please forget about that dreadful letter i sent you last week i was feeling terribly lonely and miserable and sore throaty the night i wrote i didn't know it but i was just sickening for tonsillitis and grippe and lots of things mixed i'm in the infirmary now and have been here for six days this is the first time they would let me sit up and have a pen and paper the head nurse is very bossy but i've been thinking about it all the time and i shan't get well until you forgive me here is a picture of the way i look with a bandage tied around my head in rabbit's ears doesn't that arouse your sympathy i am having sublingual gland swelling and i've been studying physiology all the year without ever hearing of sublingual glands how futile a thing is education i can't write any more i get rather shaky when i sit up too long please forgive me for being impertinent and ungrateful i was badly brought up yours with love judy abbott the infirmary 4th april dearest daddy long legs yesterday evening just towards dark when i was sitting up in bed looking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life in a great institution the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me and filled with the loveliest pink rosebuds and much nicer still it contained a card with a very polite message written in a funny little uphill back hand but one which shows a great deal of character thank you daddy a thousand times your flowers make the first real true present i ever received in my life if you want to know what a baby i am i lay down and cried because i was so happy now that i am sure you read my letters i'll make them much more interesting so they'll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around them only please take out that dreadful one and burn it up i'd hate to think that you ever read it over thank you for making a very sick cross miserable freshman cheerful probably you have lots of loving family and friends and you don't know what it feels like to be alone but i do goodbye i'll promise never to be horrid again because now i know you're a real person also i'll promise never to bother you with any more questions do you still hate girls yours for ever judy 8th hour monday dear daddy long legs i hope you aren't the trustee who sat on the toad it went off i was told with quite a pop so probably he was a fatter trustee do you remember the little dugout places with gratings over them by the laundry windows in the john grier home every spring when the hoptoad season opened we used to form a collection of toads and keep them in those window holes and occasionally they would spill over into the laundry causing a very pleasurable commotion on wash days we were severely punished for our activities in this direction but in spite of all discouragement the toads would collect and one day well i won't bore you with particulars but somehow one of the fattest biggest juciest toads got into one of those big leather arm chairs in the trustees room and that afternoon at the trustees meeting but i dare say you were there and recall the rest looking back dispassionately after a period of time i will say that punishment was merited and if i remember rightly adequate i don't know why i am in such a reminiscent mood except that spring and the reappearance of toads always awakens the old acquisitive instinct the only thing that keeps me from starting a collection is the fact that no rule exists against it after chapel thursday what do you think is my favourite book just now i mean i change every three days wuthering heights emily bronte was quite young when she wrote it and had never been outside of haworth churchyard she had never known any men in her life how could she imagine a man like heathcliffe i couldn't do it and i'm quite young and never outside the john grier asylum i've had every chance in the world sometimes a dreadful fear comes over me that i'm not a genius will you be awfully disappointed daddy if i don't turn out to be a great author in the spring when everything is so beautiful and green and budding i feel like turning my back on lessons and running away to play with the weather there are such lots of adventures out in the fields it's much more entertaining to live books than to write them ow that was a shriek which brought sallie and julia and for a disgusted moment the senior from across the hall it was caused by a centipede like this only worse just as i had finished the last sentence and was thinking what to say next plump it fell off the ceiling and landed at my side i tipped two cups off the tea table in trying to get away sallie whacked it with the back of my hair brush which i shall never be able to use again and killed the front end but the rear fifty feet ran under the bureau and escaped this dormitory owing to its age and ivy covered walls is full of centipedes they are dreadful creatures i'd rather find a tiger under the bed friday 9.30 p.m such a lot of troubles i didn't hear the rising bell this morning then i broke my shoestring while i was hurrying to dress and dropped my collar button down my neck i was late for breakfast and also for first hour recitation i forgot to take any blotting paper and my fountain pen leaked in trigonometry the professor and i had a disagreement touching a little matter of logarithms on looking it up i find that she was right we had mutton stew and pie plant for lunch hate em both they taste like the asylum the post brought me nothing but bills though i must say that i never do get anything else my family are not the kind that write in english class this afternoon we had an unexpected written lesson this was it i asked no other thing no other was denied i offered being for it the mighty merchant smiled brazil he twirled a button without a glance my way but madam is there nothing else that we can show today that is a poem i don't know who wrote it or what it means it was simply printed out on the blackboard when we arrived and we were ordered to comment upon it when i read the first verse i thought i had an idea the mighty merchant was a divinity who distributes blessings in return for virtuous deeds but when i got to the second verse and found him twirling a button it seemed a blasphemous supposition and i hastily changed my mind the rest of the class was in the same predicament and there we sat for three quarters of an hour with blank paper and equally blank minds getting an education is an awfully wearing process but this didn't end the day there's worse to come it rained so we couldn't play golf but had to go to gymnasium instead the girl next to me banged my elbow with an indian club i got home to find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come and the skirt was so tight that i couldn't sit down friday is sweeping day and the maid had mixed all the papers on my desk we had tombstone for dessert milk and gelatin flavoured with vanilla we were kept in chapel twenty minutes later than usual to listen to a speech about womanly women and then just as i was settling down with a sigh of well earned relief to the portrait of a lady a girl named ackerly a dough faced deadly unintermittently stupid girl who sits next to me in latin because her name begins with a i wish mrs lippett had named me zabriski came to ask if monday's lesson commenced at paragraph 69 or 70 and stayed one hour she has just gone did you ever hear of such a discouraging series of events it isn't the big troubles in life that require character anybody can rise to a crisis and face a crushing tragedy with courage but to meet the petty hazards of the day with a laugh i really think that requires spirit it's the kind of character that i am going to develop i am going to pretend that all life is just a game which i must play as skilfully and fairly as i can if i lose i am going to shrug my shoulders and laugh also if i win anyway i am going to be a sport you will never hear me complain again daddy dear because julia wears silk stockings and centipedes drop off the wall yours ever judy answer soon 27th may daddy long legs esq dear sir i am in receipt of a letter from mrs lippett she hopes that i am doing well in deportment and studies since i probably have no place to go this summer she will let me come back to the asylum and work for my board until college opens i hate the john grier home i'd rather die than go back yours most truthfully jerusha abbott cher daddy jambes longes vous etes un brick je suis tres heureuse about the farm parceque je n'ai jamais been on a farm dans ma vie and i'd hate to retourner chez john grier et wash dishes tout l'ete there would be danger of quelque chose affreuse happening parceque j'ai perdue ma humilite d'autre fois et j'ai peur that i would just break out quelque jour et smash every cup and saucer dans la maison pardon brievete et paper je ne peux pas send des mes nouvelles parceque je suis dans french class et j'ai peur que monsieur le professeur is going to call on me tout de suite he did au revoir je vous aime beaucoup judy 30th may dear daddy long legs did you ever see this campus that is merely a rhetorical question don't let it annoy you it is a heavenly spot in may all the shrubs are in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young green even the old pines look fresh and new the grass is dotted with yellow dandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses everybody is joyous and carefree for vacation's coming and with that to look forward to examinations don't count isn't that a happy frame of mind to be in and oh daddy i'm the happiest of all because i'm not in the asylum any more and i'm not anybody's nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper i should have been you know except for you i'm sorry now for all my past badnesses i'm sorry i was ever impertinent to mrs lippett i'm sorry i ever slapped freddie perkins i'm sorry i ever filled the sugar bowl with salt i'm sorry"
