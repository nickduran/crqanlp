"1" "terrified old man staggering feebly and hopelessly from what must have been some very terrible fate if one could judge from the horrified expressions he continually cast behind him toward the wood he came stumbling on in my direction he had covered but a short distance from the forest when i beheld the first of his pursuers a sagoth one of those grim and terrible gorilla men who guard the mighty mahars in their buried cities faring forth from time to time upon slave raiding or punitive expeditions against the human race of pellucidar of whom the dominant race of the inner world think as we think of the bison or the wild sheep of our own world close behind the foremost sagoth came others until a full dozen raced shouting after the terror stricken old man they would be upon him shortly that was plain one of them was rapidly overhauling him his back thrown spear arm testifying to his purpose and then quite with the suddenness of an unexpected blow i realized a past familiarity with the gait and carriage of the fugitive simultaneously there swept over me the staggering fact that the old man was perry that he was about to die before my very eyes with no hope that i could reach him in time to avert the awful catastrophe for to me it meant a real catastrophe perry was my best friend dian of course i looked upon as more than friend she was my mate a part of me i had entirely forgotten the rifle in my hand and the revolvers at my belt one does not readily synchronize his thoughts with the stone age and the twentieth century simultaneously now from past habit i still thought in the stone age and in my thoughts of the stone age there were no thoughts of firearms the fellow was almost upon perry when the feel of the gun in my hand awoke me from the lethargy of terror that had gripped me from behind my boulder i threw up the heavy express rifle a mighty engine of destruction that might bring down a cave bear or a mammoth at a single shot and let drive at the sagoth's broad hairy breast at the sound of the shot he stopped stock still his spear dropped from his hand then he lunged forward upon his face the effect upon the others was little less remarkable perry alone could have possibly guessed the meaning of the loud report or explained its connection with the sudden collapse of the sagoth the other gorilla men halted for but an instant then with renewed shrieks of rage they sprang forward to finish perry at the same time i stepped from behind my boulder drawing one of my revolvers that i might conserve the more precious ammunition of the express rifle quickly i fired again with the lesser weapon then it was that all eyes were directed toward me another sagoth fell to the bullet from the revolver but it did not stop his companions they were out for revenge as well as blood now and they meant to have both as i ran forward toward perry i fired four more shots dropping three of our antagonists then at last the remaining seven wavered it was too much for them this roaring death that leaped invisible upon them from a great distance as they hesitated i reached perry's side i have never seen such an expression upon any man's face as that upon perry's when he recognized me i have no words wherewith to describe it there was not time to talk then scarce for a greeting i thrust the full loaded revolver into his hand fired the last shot in my own and reloaded there were but six sagoths left then they started toward us once more though i could see that they were terrified probably as much by the noise of the guns as by their effects they never reached us half way the three that remained turned and fled and we let them go the last we saw of them they were disappearing into the tangled undergrowth of the forest and then perry turned and threw his arms about my neck and burying his old face upon my shoulder wept like a child chapter ii traveling with terror we made camp there beside the peaceful river there perry told me all that had befallen him since i had departed for the outer crust it seemed that hooja had made it appear that i had intentionally left dian behind and that i did not purpose ever returning to pellucidar he told them that i was of another world and that i had tired of this and of its inhabitants to dian he had explained that i had a mate in the world to which i was returning that i had never intended taking dian the beautiful back with me and that she had seen the last of me shortly afterward dian had disappeared from the camp nor had perry seen or heard aught of her since he had no conception of the time that had elapsed since i had departed but guessed that many years had dragged their slow way into the past hooja too had disappeared very soon after dian had left the sarians under ghak the hairy one and the amozites under dacor the strong one dian's brother had fallen out over my supposed defection for ghak would not believe that i had thus treacherously deceived and deserted them the result had been that these two powerful tribes had fallen upon one another with the new weapons that perry and i had taught them to make and to use other tribes of the new federation took sides with the original disputants or set up petty revolutions of their own the result was the total demolition of the work we had so well started taking advantage of the tribal war the mahars had gathered their sagoths in force and fallen upon one tribe after another in rapid succession wreaking awful havoc among them and reducing them for the most part to as pitiable a state of terror as that from which we had raised them alone of all the once mighty federation the sarians and the amozites with a few other tribes continued to maintain their defiance of the mahars but these tribes were still divided among themselves nor had it seemed at all probable to perry when he had last been among them that any attempt at re amalgamation would be made and thus your majesty he concluded has faded back into the oblivion of the stone age our wondrous dream and with it has gone the first empire of pellucidar we both had to smile at the use of my royal title yet i was indeed still emperor of pellucidar and some day i meant to rebuild what the vile act of the treacherous hooja had torn down but first i would find my empress to me she was worth forty empires have you no clue as to the whereabouts of dian i asked none whatever replied perry it was in search of her that i came to the pretty pass in which you discovered me and from which david you saved me i knew perfectly well that you had not intentionally deserted either dian or pellucidar i guessed that in some way hooja the sly one was at the bottom of the matter and i determined to go to amoz where i guessed that dian might come to the protection of her brother and do my utmost to convince her and through her dacor the strong one that we had all been victims of a treacherous plot to which you were no party i came to amoz after a most trying and terrible journey only to find that dian was not among her brother's people and that they knew naught of her whereabouts dacor i am sure wanted to be fair and just but so great were his grief and anger over the disappearance of his sister that he could not listen to reason but kept repeating time and again that only your return to pellucidar could prove the honesty of your intentions then came a stranger from another tribe sent i am sure at the instigation of hooja he so turned the amozites against me that i was forced to flee their country to escape assassination in attempting to return to sari i became lost and then the sagoths discovered me for a long time i eluded them hiding in caves and wading in rivers to throw them off my trail i lived on nuts and fruits and the edible roots that chance threw in my way i traveled on and on in what directions i could not even guess and at last i could elude them no longer and the end came as i had long foreseen that it would come except that i had not foreseen that you would be there to save me we rested in our camp until perry had regained sufficient strength to travel again we planned much rebuilding all our shattered air castles but above all we planned most to find dian i could not believe that she was dead yet where she might be in this savage world and under what frightful conditions she might be living i could not guess when perry was rested we returned to the prospector where he fitted himself out fully like a civilized human being under clothing socks shoes khaki jacket and breeches and good substantial puttees when i had come upon him he was clothed in rough sadak sandals a gee string and a tunic fashioned from the shaggy hide of a thag now he wore real clothing again for the first time since the ape folk had stripped us of our apparel that long gone day that had witnessed our advent within pellucidar with a bandoleer of cartridges across his shoulder two six shooters at his hips and a rifle in his hand he was a much rejuvenated perry indeed he was quite a different person altogether from the rather shaky old man who had entered the prospector with me ten or eleven years before for the trial trip that had plunged us into such wondrous adventures and into such a strange and hitherto undreamed of world now he was straight and active his muscles almost atrophied from disuse in his former life had filled out he was still an old man of course but instead of appearing ten years older than he really was as he had when we left the outer world he now appeared about ten years younger the wild free life of pellucidar had worked wonders for him well it must need have done so or killed him for a man of perry's former physical condition could not long have survived the dangers and rigors of the primitive life of the inner world perry had been greatly interested in my map and in the royal observatory at greenwich by use of the pedometers we had retraced our way to the prospector with ease and accuracy now that we were ready to set out again we decided to follow a different route on the chance that it might lead us into more familiar territory i shall not weary you with a repetition of the countless adventures of our long search encounters with wild beasts of gigantic size were of almost daily occurrence but with our deadly express rifles we ran comparatively little risk when one recalls that previously we had both traversed this world of frightful dangers inadequately armed with crude primitive weapons and all but naked we ate and slept many times so many that we lost count and so i do not know how long we roamed though our map shows the distances and directions quite accurately we must have covered a great many thousand square miles of territory and yet we had seen nothing in the way of a familiar landmark when from the heights of a mountain range we were crossing i descried far in the distance great masses of billowing clouds now clouds are practically unknown in the skies of pellucidar the moment that my eyes rested upon them my heart leaped i seized perry's arm and pointing toward the horizonless distance shouted the mountains of the clouds they lie close to phutra and the country of our worst enemies the mahars perry remonstrated i know it i replied but they give us a starting point from which to prosecute our search intelligently they are at least a familiar landmark they tell us that we are upon the right trail and not wandering far in the wrong direction furthermore close to the mountains of the clouds dwells a good friend ja the mezop you did not know him but you know all that he did for me and all that he will gladly do to aid me at least he can direct us upon the right direction toward sari the mountains of the clouds constitute a mighty range replied perry they must cover an enormous territory how are you to find your friend in all the great country that is visible from their rugged flanks easily i answered him for ja gave me minute directions i recall almost his exact words you need merely come to the foot of the highest peak of the mountains of the clouds there you will find a river that flows into the lural az directly opposite the mouth of the river you will see three large islands far out so far that they are barely discernible the one to the extreme left as you face them from the mouth of the river is anoroc where i rule the tribe of anoroc and so we hastened onward toward the great cloud mass that was to be our guide for several weary marches at last we came close to the towering crags alp like in their grandeur rising nobly among its noble fellows one stupendous peak reared its giant head thousands of feet above the others it was he whom we sought but at its foot no river wound down toward any sea it must rise from the opposite side suggested perry casting a rueful glance at the forbidding heights that barred our further progress we cannot endure the arctic cold of those high flung passes and to traverse the endless miles about this interminable range might require a year or more the land we seek must lie upon the opposite side of the mountains then we must cross them i insisted perry shrugged we can't do it david he repeated we are dressed for the tropics we should freeze to death among the snows and glaciers long before we had discovered a pass to the opposite side we must cross them i reiterated we will cross them i had a plan and that plan we carried out it took some time first we made a permanent camp part way up the slopes where there was good water then we set out in search of the great shaggy cave bear of the higher altitudes he is a mighty animal a terrible animal he is but little larger than his cousin of the lesser lower hills but he makes up for it in the awfulness of his ferocity and in the length and thickness of his shaggy coat it was his coat that we were after we came upon him quite unexpectedly i was trudging in advance along a rocky trail worn smooth by the padded feet of countless ages of wild beasts at a shoulder of the mountain around which the path ran i came face to face with the titan i was going up for a fur coat he was coming down for breakfast each realized that here was the very thing he sought with a horrid roar the beast charged me at my right the cliff rose straight upward for thousands of feet at my left it dropped into a dim abysmal canyon in front of me was the bear behind me was perry i shouted to him in warning and then i raised my rifle and fired into the broad breast of the creature there was no time to take aim the thing was too close upon me but that my bullet took effect was evident from the howl of rage and pain that broke from the frothing jowls it didn't stop him though i fired again and then he was upon me down i went beneath his ton of maddened clawing flesh and bone and sinew i thought my time had come i remember feeling sorry for poor old perry left all alone in this inhospitable savage world and then of a sudden i realized that the bear was gone and that i was quite unharmed i leaped to my feet my rifle still clutched in my hand and looked about for my antagonist i thought that i should find him farther down the trail probably finishing perry and so i leaped in the direction i supposed him to be to find perry perched upon a projecting rock several feet above the trail my cry of warning had given him time to reach this point of safety there he squatted his eyes wide and his mouth ajar the picture of abject terror and consternation where is he he cried when he saw me where is he didn't he come this way i asked nothing came this way replied the old man but i heard his roars he must have been as large as an elephant he was i admitted but where in the world do you suppose he disappeared to then came a possible explanation to my mind i returned to the point at which the bear had hurled me down and peered over the edge of the cliff into the abyss below far far down i saw a small brown blotch near the bottom of the canon it was the bear my second shot must have killed him and so his dead body after hurling me to the path had toppled over into the abyss i shivered at the thought of how close i too must have been to going over with him it took us a long time to reach the carcass and arduous labor to remove the great pelt but at last the thing was accomplished and we returned to camp dragging the heavy trophy behind us here we devoted another considerable period to scraping and curing it when this was done to our satisfaction we made heavy boots trousers and coats of the shaggy skin turning the fur in from the scraps we fashioned caps that came down around our ears with flaps that fell about our shoulders and breasts we were now fairly well equipped for our search for a pass to the opposite side of the mountains of the clouds our first step now was to move our camp upward to the very edge of the perpetual snows which cap this lofty range here we built a snug secure little hut which we provisioned and stored with fuel for its diminutive fireplace with our hut as a base we sallied forth in search of a pass across the range our every move was carefully noted upon our maps which we now kept in duplicate by this means we were saved tedious and unnecessary retracing of ways already explored systematically we worked upward in both directions from our base and when we had at last discovered what seemed might prove a feasible pass we moved our belongings to a new hut farther up it was hard work cold bitter cruel work not a step did we take in advance but the grim reaper strode silently in our tracks there were the great cave bears in the timber and gaunt lean wolves huge creatures twice the size of our canadian timber wolves farther up we were assailed by enormous white bears hungry devilish fellows who came roaring across the rough glacier tops at the first glimpse of us or stalked us stealthily by scent when they had not yet seen us it is one of the peculiarities of life within pellucidar that man is more often the hunted than the hunter myriad are the huge bellied carnivora of this primitive world never from birth to death are those great bellies sufficiently filled so always are their mighty owners prowling about in search of meat terribly armed for battle as they are man presents to them in his primal state an easy prey slow of foot puny of strength ill equipped by nature with natural weapons of defense the bears looked upon us as easy meat only our heavy rifles saved us from prompt extinction poor perry never was a raging lion at heart and i am convinced that the terrors of that awful period must have caused him poignant mental anguish when we were abroad pushing our trail farther and farther toward the distant break which we assumed marked a feasible way across the range we never knew at what second some great engine of clawed and fanged destruction might rush upon us from behind or lie in wait for us beyond an ice hummock or a jutting shoulder of the craggy steeps the roar of our rifles was constantly shattering the world old silence of stupendous canons upon which the eye of man had never before gazed and when in the comparative safety of our hut we lay down to sleep the great beasts roared and fought without the walls clawed and battered at the door or rushed their colossal frames headlong against the hut's sides until it rocked and trembled to the impact yes it was a gay life perry had got to taking stock of our ammunition each time we returned to the hut it became something of an obsession with him he'd count our cartridges one by one and then try to figure how long it would be before the last was expended and we must either remain in the hut until we starved to death or venture forth empty to fill the belly of some hungry bear i must admit that i too felt worried for our progress was indeed snail like and our ammunition could not last forever in discussing the problem finally we came to the decision to burn our bridges behind us and make one last supreme effort to cross the divide it would mean that we must go without sleep for a long period and with the further chance that when the time came that sleep could no longer be denied we might still be high in the frozen regions of perpetual snow and ice where sleep would mean certain death exposed as we would be to the attacks of wild beasts and without shelter from the hideous cold but we decided that we must take these chances and so at last we set forth from our hut for the last time carrying such necessities as we felt we could least afford to do without the bears seemed unusually troublesome and determined that time and as we clambered slowly upward beyond the highest point to which we had previously attained the cold became infinitely more intense presently with two great bears dogging our footsteps we entered a dense fog we had reached the heights that are so often cloud wrapped for long periods we could see nothing a few paces beyond our noses we dared not turn back into the teeth of the bears which we could hear grunting behind us to meet them in this bewildering fog would have been to court instant death perry was almost overcome by the hopelessness of our situation he flopped down on his knees and began to pray it was the first time i had heard him at his old habit since my return to pellucidar and i had thought that he had given up his little idiosyncrasy but he hadn't far from it i let him pray for a short time undisturbed and then as i was about to suggest that we had better be pushing along one of the bears in our rear let out a roar that made the earth fairly tremble beneath our feet it brought perry to his feet as if he had been stung by a wasp and sent him racing ahead through the blinding fog at a gait that i knew must soon end in disaster were it not checked crevasses in the glacier ice were far too frequent to permit of reckless speed even in a clear atmosphere and then there were hideous precipices along the edges of which our way often led us i shivered as i thought of the poor old fellow's peril at the top of my lungs i called to him to stop but he did not answer me and then i hurried on in the direction he had gone faster by far than safety dictated for a while i thought i heard him ahead of me but at last though i paused often to listen and to call to him i heard nothing more not even the grunting of the bears that had been behind us all was deathly silence the silence of the tomb about me lay the thick impenetrable fog i was alone perry was gone gone forever i had not the slightest doubt somewhere near by lay the mouth of a treacherous fissure and far down at its icy bottom lay all that was mortal of my old friend abner perry there would his body be preserved in its icy sepulcher for countless ages until on some far distant day the slow moving river of ice had wound its snail like way down to the warmer level there to disgorge its grisly evidence of grim tragedy and what in that far future age might mean baffling mystery chapter iii shooting the chutes and after through the fog i felt my way along by means of my compass i no longer heard the bears nor did i encounter one within the fog experience has since taught me that these great beasts are as terror stricken by this phenomenon as a landsman by a fog at sea and that no sooner does a fog envelop them than they make the best of their way to lower levels and a clear atmosphere it was well for me that this was true i felt very sad and lonely as i crawled along the difficult footing my own predicament weighed less heavily upon me than the loss of perry for i loved the old fellow that i should ever win the opposite slopes of the range i began to doubt for though i am naturally sanguine i imagine that the bereavement which had befallen me had cast such a gloom over my spirits that i could see no slightest ray of hope for the future then too the blighting gray oblivion of the cold damp clouds through which i wandered was distressing hope thrives best in sunlight and i am sure that it does not thrive at all in a fog but the instinct of self preservation is stronger than hope it thrives fortunately upon nothing it takes root upon the brink of the grave and blossoms in the jaws of death now it flourished bravely upon the breast of dead hope and urged me onward and upward in a stern endeavor to justify its existence as i advanced the fog became denser i could see nothing beyond my nose even the snow and ice i trod were invisible i could not see below the breast of my bearskin coat i seemed to be floating in a sea of vapor to go forward over a dangerous glacier under such conditions was little short of madness but i could not have stopped going had i known positively that death lay two paces before my nose in the first place it was too cold to stop and in the second i should have gone mad but for the excitement of the perils that beset each forward step for some time the ground had been rougher and steeper until i had been forced to scale a considerable height that had carried me from the glacier entirely i was sure from my compass that i was following the right general direction and so i kept on once more the ground was level from the wind that blew about me i guessed that i must be upon some exposed peak of ridge and then quite suddenly i stepped out into space wildly i turned and clutched at the ground that had slipped from beneath my feet only a smooth icy surface was there i found nothing to clutch or stay my fall and a moment later so great was my speed that nothing could have stayed me as suddenly as i had pitched into space with equal suddenness did i emerge from the fog out of which i shot like a projectile from a cannon into clear daylight my speed was so great that i could see nothing about me but a blurred and indistinct sheet of smooth and frozen snow that rushed past me with express train velocity i must have slid downward thousands of feet before the steep incline curved gently on to a broad smooth snow covered plateau across this i hurtled with slowly diminishing velocity until at last objects about me began to take definite shape far ahead miles and miles away i saw a great valley and mighty woods and beyond these a broad expanse of water in the nearer foreground i discerned a"
