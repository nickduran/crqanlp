"1" "at my work and had a good hand with my needle though i was yet very young but the kindness of the ladies of the town did not end here for when they came to understand that i was no more maintained by the public allowance as before they gave me money oftener than formerly and as i grew up they brought me work to do for them such as linen to make and laces to mend and heads to dress up and not only paid me for doing them but even taught me how to do them so that now i was a gentlewoman indeed as i understood that word i not only found myself clothes and paid my nurse for my keeping but got money in my pocket too beforehand the ladies also gave me clothes frequently of their own or their children's some stockings some petticoats some gowns some one thing some another and these my old woman managed for me like a mere mother and kept them for me obliged me to mend them and turn them and twist them to the best advantage for she was a rare housewife at last one of the ladies took so much fancy to me that she would have me home to her house for a month she said to be among her daughters now though this was exceeding kind in her yet as my old good woman said to her unless she resolved to keep me for good and all she would do the little gentlewoman more harm than good well says the lady that's true and therefore i'll only take her home for a week then that i may see how my daughters and she agree together and how i like her temper and then i'll tell you more and in the meantime if anybody comes to see her as they used to do you may only tell them you have sent her out to my house this was prudently managed enough and i went to the lady's house but i was so pleased there with the young ladies and they so pleased with me that i had enough to do to come away and they were as unwilling to part with me however i did come away and lived almost a year more with my honest old woman and began now to be very helpful to her for i was almost fourteen years old was tall of my age and looked a little womanish but i had such a taste of genteel living at the lady's house that i was not so easy in my old quarters as i used to be and i thought it was fine to be a gentlewoman indeed for i had quite other notions of a gentlewoman now than i had before and as i thought i say that it was fine to be a gentlewoman so i loved to be among gentlewomen and therefore i longed to be there again about the time that i was fourteen years and a quarter old my good nurse mother i rather to call her fell sick and died i was then in a sad condition indeed for as there is no great bustle in putting an end to a poor body's family when once they are carried to the grave so the poor good woman being buried the parish children she kept were immediately removed by the church wardens the school was at an end and the children of it had no more to do but just stay at home till they were sent somewhere else and as for what she left her daughter a married woman with six or seven children came and swept it all away at once and removing the goods they had no more to say to me than to jest with me and tell me that the little gentlewoman might set up for herself if she pleased i was frighted out of my wits almost and knew not what to do for i was as it were turned out of doors to the wide world and that which was still worse the old honest woman had two and twenty shillings of mine in her hand which was all the estate the little gentlewoman had in the world and when i asked the daughter for it she huffed me and laughed at me and told me she had nothing to do with it it was true the good poor woman had told her daughter of it and that it lay in such a place that it was the child's money and had called once or twice for me to give it me but i was unhappily out of the way somewhere or other and when i came back she was past being in a condition to speak of it however the daughter was so honest afterwards as to give it me though at first she used me cruelly about it now was i a poor gentlewoman indeed and i was just that very night to be turned into the wide world for the daughter removed all the goods and i had not so much as a lodging to go to or a bit of bread to eat but it seems some of the neighbours who had known my circumstances took so much compassion of me as to acquaint the lady in whose family i had been a week as i mentioned above and immediately she sent her maid to fetch me away and two of her daughters came with the maid though unsent so i went with them bag and baggage and with a glad heart you may be sure the fright of my condition had made such an impression upon me that i did not want now to be a gentlewoman but was very willing to be a servant and that any kind of servant they thought fit to have me be but my new generous mistress for she exceeded the good woman i was with before in everything as well as in the matter of estate i say in everything except honesty and for that though this was a lady most exactly just yet i must not forget to say on all occasions that the first though poor was as uprightly honest as it was possible for any one to be i was no sooner carried away as i have said by this good gentlewoman but the first lady that is to say the mayoress that was sent her two daughters to take care of me and another family which had taken notice of me when i was the little gentlewoman and had given me work to do sent for me after her so that i was mightily made of as we say nay and they were not a little angry especially madam the mayoress that her friend had taken me away from her as she called it for as she said i was hers by right she having been the first that took any notice of me but they that had me would not part with me and as for me though i should have been very well treated with any of the others yet i could not be better than where i was here i continued till i was between seventeen and eighteen years old and here i had all the advantages for my education that could be imagined the lady had masters home to the house to teach her daughters to dance and to speak french and to write and other to teach them music and i was always with them i learned as fast as they and though the masters were not appointed to teach me yet i learned by imitation and inquiry all that they learned by instruction and direction so that in short i learned to dance and speak french as well as any of them and to sing much better for i had a better voice than any of them i could not so readily come at playing on the harpsichord or spinet because i had no instrument of my own to practice on and could only come at theirs in the intervals when they left it which was uncertain but yet i learned tolerably well too and the young ladies at length got two instruments that is to say a harpsichord and a spinet too and then they taught me themselves but as to dancing they could hardly help my learning country dances because they always wanted me to make up even number and on the other hand they were as heartily willing to learn me everything that they had been taught themselves as i could be to take the learning by this means i had as i have said above all the advantages of education that i could have had if i had been as much a gentlewoman as they were with whom i lived and in some things i had the advantage of my ladies though they were my superiors but they were all the gifts of nature and which all their fortunes could not furnish first i was apparently handsomer than any of them secondly i was better shaped and thirdly i sang better by which i mean i had a better voice in all which you will i hope allow me to say i do not speak my own conceit of myself but the opinion of all that knew the family i had with all these the common vanity of my sex viz that being really taken for very handsome or if you please for a great beauty i very well knew it and had as good an opinion of myself as anybody else could have of me and particularly i loved to hear anybody speak of it which could not but happen to me sometimes and was a great satisfaction to me thus far i have had a smooth story to tell of myself and in all this part of my life i not only had the reputation of living in a very good family and a family noted and respected everywhere for virtue and sobriety and for every valuable thing but i had the character too of a very sober modest and virtuous young woman and such i had always been neither had i yet any occasion to think of anything else or to know what a temptation to wickedness meant but that which i was too vain of was my ruin or rather my vanity was the cause of it the lady in the house where i was had two sons young gentlemen of very promising parts and of extraordinary behaviour and it was my misfortune to be very well with them both but they managed themselves with me in a quite different manner the eldest a gay gentleman that knew the town as well as the country and though he had levity enough to do an ill natured thing yet had too much judgment of things to pay too dear for his pleasures he began with the unhappy snare to all women viz taking notice upon all occasions how pretty i was as he called it how agreeable how well carriaged and the like and this he contrived so subtly as if he had known as well how to catch a woman in his net as a partridge when he went a setting for he would contrive to be talking this to his sisters when though i was not by yet when he knew i was not far off but that i should be sure to hear him his sisters would return softly to him hush brother she will hear you she is but in the next room then he would put it off and talk softlier as if he had not known it and begin to acknowledge he was wrong and then as if he had forgot himself he would speak aloud again and i that was so well pleased to hear it was sure to listen for it upon all occasions after he had thus baited his hook and found easily enough the method how to lay it in my way he played an opener game and one day going by his sister's chamber when i was there doing something about dressing her he comes in with an air of gaiety oh mrs betty said he to me how do you do mrs betty don't your cheeks burn mrs betty i made a curtsy and blushed but said nothing what makes you talk so brother says the lady why says he we have been talking of her below stairs this half hour well says his sister you can say no harm of her that i am sure so tis no matter what you have been talking about nay says he tis so far from talking harm of her that we have been talking a great deal of good and a great many fine things have been said of mrs betty i assure you and particularly that she is the handsomest young woman in colchester and in short they begin to toast her health in the town i wonder at you brother says the sister betty wants but one thing but she had as good want everything for the market is against our sex just now and if a young woman have beauty birth breeding wit sense manners modesty and all these to an extreme yet if she have not money she's nobody she had as good want them all for nothing but money now recommends a woman the men play the game all into their own hands her younger brother who was by cried hold sister you run too fast i am an exception to your rule i assure you if i find a woman so accomplished as you talk of i say i assure you i would not trouble myself about the money oh says the sister but you will take care not to fancy one then without the money you don't know that neither says the brother but why sister says the elder brother why do you exclaim so at the men for aiming so much at the fortune you are none of them that want a fortune whatever else you want i understand you brother replies the lady very smartly you suppose i have the money and want the beauty but as times go now the first will do without the last so i have the better of my neighbours well says the younger brother but your neighbours as you call them may be even with you for beauty will steal a husband sometimes in spite of money and when the maid chances to be handsomer than the mistress she oftentimes makes as good a market and rides in a coach before her i thought it was time for me to withdraw and leave them and i did so but not so far but that i heard all their discourse in which i heard abundance of the fine things said of myself which served to prompt my vanity but as i soon found was not the way to increase my interest in the family for the sister and the younger brother fell grievously out about it and as he said some very disobliging things to her upon my account so i could easily see that she resented them by her future conduct to me which indeed was very unjust to me for i had never had the least thought of what she suspected as to her younger brother indeed the elder brother in his distant remote way had said a great many things as in jest which i had the folly to believe were in earnest or to flatter myself with the hopes of what i ought to have supposed he never intended and perhaps never thought of it happened one day that he came running upstairs towards the room where his sisters used to sit and work as he often used to do and calling to them before he came in as was his way too i being there alone stepped to the door and said sir the ladies are not here they are walked down the garden as i stepped forward to say this towards the door he was just got to the door and clasping me in his arms as if it had been by chance oh mrs betty says he are you here that's better still i want to speak with you more than i do with them and then having me in his arms he kissed me three or four times i struggled to get away and yet did it but faintly neither and he held me fast and still kissed me till he was almost out of breath and then sitting down says dear betty i am in love with you his words i must confess fired my blood all my spirits flew about my heart and put me into disorder enough which he might easily have seen in my face he repeated it afterwards several times that he was in love with me and my heart spoke as plain as a voice that i liked it nay whenever he said i am in love with you my blushes plainly replied would you were sir however nothing else passed at that time it was but a surprise and when he was gone i soon recovered myself again he had stayed longer with me but he happened to look out at the window and see his sisters coming up the garden so he took his leave kissed me again told me he was very serious and i should hear more of him very quickly and away he went leaving me infinitely pleased though surprised and had there not been one misfortune in it i had been in the right but the mistake lay here that mrs betty was in earnest and the gentleman was not from this time my head ran upon strange things and i may truly say i was not myself to have such a gentleman talk to me of being in love with me and of my being such a charming creature as he told me i was these were things i knew not how to bear my vanity was elevated to the last degree it is true i had my head full of pride but knowing nothing of the wickedness of the times i had not one thought of my own safety or of my virtue about me and had my young master offered it at first sight he might have taken any liberty he thought fit with me but he did not see his advantage which was my happiness for that time after this attack it was not long but he found an opportunity to catch me again and almost in the same posture indeed it had more of design in it on his part though not on my part it was thus the young ladies were all gone a visiting with their mother his brother was out of town and as for his father he had been in london for a week before he had so well watched me that he knew where i was though i did not so much as know that he was in the house and he briskly comes up the stairs and seeing me at work comes into the room to me directly and began just as he did before with taking me in his arms and kissing me for almost a quarter of an hour together it was his younger sister's chamber that i was in and as there was nobody in the house but the maids below stairs he was it may be the ruder in short he began to be in earnest with me indeed perhaps he found me a little too easy for god knows i made no resistance to him while he only held me in his arms and kissed me indeed i was too well pleased with it to resist him much however as it were tired with that kind of work we sat down and there he talked with me a great while he said he was charmed with me and that he could not rest night or day till he had told me how he was in love with me and if i was able to love him again and would make him happy i should be the saving of his life and many such fine things i said little to him again but easily discovered that i was a fool and that i did not in the least perceive what he meant then he walked about the room and taking me by the hand i walked with him and by and by taking his advantage he threw me down upon the bed and kissed me there most violently but to give him his due offered no manner of rudeness to me only kissed a great while after this he thought he had heard somebody come upstairs so got off from the bed lifted me up professing a great deal of love for me but told me it was all an honest affection and that he meant no ill to me and with that he put five guineas into my hand and went away downstairs i was more confounded with the money than i was before with the love and began to be so elevated that i scarce knew the ground i stood on i am the more particular in this part that if my story comes to be read by any innocent young body they may learn from it to guard themselves against the mischiefs which attend an early knowledge of their own beauty if a young woman once thinks herself handsome she never doubts the truth of any man that tells her he is in love with her for if she believes herself charming enough to captivate him tis natural to expect the effects of it this young gentleman had fired his inclination as much as he had my vanity and as if he had found that he had an opportunity and was sorry he did not take hold of it he comes up again in half an hour or thereabouts and falls to work with me again as before only with a little less introduction and first when he entered the room he turned about and shut the door mrs betty said he i fancied before somebody was coming upstairs but it was not so however adds he if they find me in the room with you they shan't catch me a kissing of you i told him i did not know who should be coming upstairs for i believed there was nobody in the house but the cook and the other maid and they never came up those stairs well my dear says he tis good to be sure however and so he sits down and we began to talk and now though i was still all on fire with his first visit and said little he did as it were put words in my mouth telling me how passionately he loved me and that though he could not mention such a thing till he came to this estate yet he was resolved to make me happy then and himself too that is to say to marry me and abundance of such fine things which i poor fool did not understand the drift of but acted as if there was no such thing as any kind of love but that which tended to matrimony and if he had spoke of that i had no room as well as no power to have said no but we were not come that length yet we had not sat long but he got up and stopping my very breath with kisses threw me upon the bed again but then being both well warmed he went farther with me than decency permits me to mention nor had it been in my power to have denied him at that moment had he offered much more than he did however though he took these freedoms with me it did not go to that which they call the last favour which to do him justice he did not attempt and he made that self denial of his a plea for all his freedoms with me upon other occasions after this when this was over he stayed but a little while but he put almost a handful of gold in my hand and left me making a thousand protestations of his passion for me and of his loving me above all the women in the world it will not be strange if i now began to think but alas it was but with very little solid reflection i had a most unbounded stock of vanity and pride and but a very little stock of virtue i did indeed case sometimes with myself what young master aimed at but thought of nothing but the fine words and the gold whether he intended to marry me or not to marry me seemed a matter of no great consequence to me nor did my thoughts so much as suggest to me the necessity of making any capitulation for myself till he came to make a kind of formal proposal to me as you shall hear presently thus i gave up myself to a readiness of being ruined without the least concern and am a fair memento to all young women whose vanity prevails over their virtue nothing was ever so stupid on both sides had i acted as became me and resisted as virtue and honour require this gentleman had either desisted his attacks finding no room to expect the accomplishment of his design or had made fair and honourable proposals of marriage in which case whoever had blamed him nobody could have blamed me in short if he had known me and how easy the trifle he aimed at was to be had he would have troubled his head no farther but have given me four or five guineas and have lain with me the next time he had come at me and if i had known his thoughts and how hard he thought i would be to be gained i might have made my own terms with him and if i had not capitulated for an immediate marriage i might for a maintenance till marriage and might have had what i would for he was already rich to excess besides what he had in expectation but i seemed wholly to have abandoned all such thoughts as these and was taken up only with the pride of my beauty and of being beloved by such a gentleman as for the gold i spent whole hours in looking upon it i told the guineas over and over a thousand times a day never a poor vain creature was so wrapt up with every part of the story as i was not considering what was before me and how near my ruin was at the door indeed i think i rather wished for that ruin than studied to avoid it in the meantime however i was cunning enough not to give the least room to any in the family to suspect me or to imagine that i had the least correspondence with this young gentleman i scarce ever looked towards him in public or answered if he spoke to me when anybody was near us but for all that we had every now and then a little encounter where we had room for a word or two and now and then a kiss but no fair opportunity for the mischief intended and especially considering that he made more circumlocution than if he had known my thoughts he had occasion for and the work appearing difficult to him he really made it so but as the devil is an unwearied tempter so he never fails to find opportunity for that wickedness he invites to it was one evening that i was in the garden with his two younger sisters and himself and all very innocently merry when he found means to convey a note into my hand by which he directed me to understand that he would to morrow desire me publicly to go of an errand for him into the town and that i should see him somewhere by the way accordingly after dinner he very gravely says to me his sisters being all by mrs betty i must ask a favour of you what's that says his second sister nay sister says he very gravely if you can't spare mrs betty to day any other time will do yes they said they could spare her well enough and the sister begged pardon for asking which they did but of mere course without any meaning well but brother says the eldest sister you must tell mrs betty what it is if it be any private business that we must not hear you may call her out there she is why sister says the gentleman very gravely what do you mean i only desire her to go into the high street and then he pulls out a turnover to such a shop and then he tells them a long story of two fine neckcloths he had bid money for and he wanted to have me go and make an errand to buy a neck to the turnover that he showed to see if they would take my money for the neckcloths to bid a shilling more and haggle with them and then he made more errands and so continued to have such petty business to do that i should be sure to"
