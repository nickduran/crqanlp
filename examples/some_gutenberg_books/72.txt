"1" "thuvia of ptarth saw only strangers warriors in the harness of dusar now she took fright but too late before she could voice but a single cry rough hands seized her a heavy silken scarf was wound about her head she was lifted in strong arms and borne to the deck of the flier there was the sudden whirl of propellers the rushing of air against her body and from far beneath the shouting and the challenge from the guard racing toward the south another flier sped toward helium in its cabin a tall red man bent over the soft sole of an upturned sandal with delicate instruments he measured the faint imprint of a small object which appeared there upon a pad beside him was the outline of a key and here he noted the results of his measurements a smile played upon his lips as he completed his task and turned to one who waited at the opposite side of the table the man is a genius he remarked only a genius could have evolved such a lock as this is designed to spring here take the sketch larok and give all thine own genius full and unfettered freedom in reproducing it in metal the warrior artificer bowed man builds naught he said that man may not destroy then he left the cabin with the sketch as dawn broke upon the lofty towers which mark the twin cities of helium the scarlet tower of one and the yellow tower of its sister a flier floated lazily out of the north upon its bow was emblazoned the signia of a lesser noble of a far city of the empire of helium its leisurely approach and the evident confidence with which it moved across the city aroused no suspicion in the minds of the sleepy guard their round of duty nearly done they had little thought beyond the coming of those who were to relieve them peace reigned throughout helium stagnant emasculating peace helium had no enemies there was naught to fear without haste the nearest air patrol swung sluggishly about and approached the stranger at easy speaking distance the officer upon her deck hailed the incoming craft the cheery kaor and the plausible explanation that the owner had come from distant parts for a few days of pleasure in gay helium sufficed the air patrol boat sheered off passing again upon its way the stranger continued toward a public landing stage where she dropped into the ways and came to rest at about the same time a warrior entered her cabin it is done vas kor he said handing a small metal key to the tall noble who had just risen from his sleeping silks and furs good exclaimed the latter you must have worked upon it all during the night larok the warrior nodded now fetch me the heliumetic metal you wrought some days since commanded vas kor this done the warrior assisted his master to replace the handsome jewelled metal of his harness with the plainer ornaments of an ordinary fighting man of helium and with the insignia of the same house that appeared upon the bow of the flier vas kor breakfasted on board then he emerged upon the aerial dock entered an elevator and was borne quickly to the street below where he was soon engulfed by the early morning throng of workers hastening to their daily duties among them his warrior trappings were no more remarkable than is a pair of trousers upon broadway all martian men are warriors save those physically unable to bear arms the tradesman and his clerk clank with their martial trappings as they pursue their vocations the schoolboy coming into the world as he does almost adult from the snowy shell that has encompassed his development for five long years knows so little of life without a sword at his hip that he would feel the same discomfiture at going abroad unarmed that an earth boy would experience in walking the streets knicker bockerless vas kor's destination lay in greater helium which lies some seventy five miles across the level plain from lesser helium he had landed at the latter city because the air patrol is less suspicious and alert than that above the larger metropolis where lies the palace of the jeddak as he moved with the throng in the parklike canyon of the thoroughfare the life of an awakening martian city was in evidence about him houses raised high upon their slender metal columns for the night were dropping gently toward the ground among the flowers upon the scarlet sward which lies about the buildings children were already playing and comely women laughing and chatting with their neighbours as they culled gorgeous blossoms for the vases within doors the pleasant kaor of the barsoomian greeting fell continually upon the ears of the stranger as friends and neighbours took up the duties of a new day the district in which he had landed was residential a district of merchants of the more prosperous sort everywhere were evidences of luxury and wealth slaves appeared upon every housetop with gorgeous silks and costly furs laying them in the sun for airing jewel encrusted women lolled even thus early upon the carven balconies before their sleeping apartments later in the day they would repair to the roofs when the slaves had arranged couches and pitched silken canopies to shade them from the sun strains of inspiring music broke pleasantly from open windows for the martians have solved the problem of attuning the nerves pleasantly to the sudden transition from sleep to waking that proves so difficult a thing for most earth folk above him raced the long light passenger fliers plying each in its proper plane between the numerous landing stages for internal passenger traffic landing stages that tower high into the heavens are for the great international passenger liners freighters have other landing stages at various lower levels to within a couple of hundred feet of the ground nor dare any flier rise or drop from one plane to another except in certain restricted districts where horizontal traffic is forbidden along the close cropped sward which paves the avenue ground fliers were moving in continuous lines in opposite directions for the greater part they skimmed along the surface of the sward soaring gracefully into the air at times to pass over a slower going driver ahead or at intersections where the north and south traffic has the right of way and the east and west must rise above it from private hangars upon many a roof top fliers were darting into the line of traffic gay farewells and parting admonitions mingled with the whirring of motors and the subdued noises of the city yet with all the swift movement and the countless thousands rushing hither and thither the predominant suggestion was that of luxurious ease and soft noiselessness martians dislike harsh discordant clamour the only loud noises they can abide are the martial sounds of war the clash of arms the collision of two mighty dreadnoughts of the air to them there is no sweeter music than this at the intersection of two broad avenues vas kor descended from the street level to one of the great pneumatic stations of the city here he paid before a little wicket the fare to his destination with a couple of the dull oval coins of helium beyond the gatekeeper he came to a slowly moving line of what to earthly eyes would have appeared to be conical nosed eight foot projectiles for some giant gun in slow procession the things moved in single file along a grooved track a half dozen attendants assisted passengers to enter or directed these carriers to their proper destination vas kor approached one that was empty upon its nose was a dial and a pointer he set the pointer for a certain station in greater helium raised the arched lid of the thing stepped in and lay down upon the upholstered bottom an attendant closed the lid which locked with a little click and the carrier continued its slow way presently it switched itself automatically to another track to enter a moment later one of the series of dark mouthed tubes the instant that its entire length was within the black aperture it sprang forward with the speed of a rifle ball there was an instant of whizzing a soft though sudden stop and slowly the carrier emerged upon another platform another attendant raised the lid and vas kor stepped out at the station beneath the centre of greater helium seventy five miles from the point at which he had embarked here he sought the street level stepping immediately into a waiting ground flier he spoke no word to the slave sitting in the driver's seat it was evident that he had been expected and that the fellow had received his instructions before his coming scarcely had vas kor taken his seat when the flier went quickly into the fast moving procession turning presently from the broad and crowded avenue into a less congested street presently it left the thronged district behind to enter a section of small shops where it stopped before the entrance to one which bore the sign of a dealer in foreign silks vas kor entered the low ceiling room a man at the far end motioned him toward an inner apartment giving no further sign of recognition until he had passed in after the caller and closed the door then he faced his visitor saluting deferentially most noble he commenced but vas kor silenced him with a gesture no formalities he said we must forget that i am aught other than your slave if all has been as carefully carried out as it has been planned we have no time to waste instead we should be upon our way to the slave market are you ready the merchant nodded and turning to a great chest produced the unemblazoned trappings of a slave these vas kor immediately donned then the two passed from the shop through a rear door traversed a winding alley to an avenue beyond where they entered a flier which awaited them five minutes later the merchant was leading his slave to the public market where a great concourse of people filled the great open space in the centre of which stood the slave block the crowds were enormous to day for carthoris prince of helium was to be the principal bidder one by one the masters mounted the rostrum beside the slave block upon which stood their chattels briefly and clearly each recounted the virtues of his particular offering when all were done the major domo of the prince of helium recalled to the block such as had favourably impressed him for such he had made a fair offer there was little haggling as to price and none at all when vas kor was placed upon the block his merchant master accepted the first offer that was made for him and thus a dusarian noble entered the household of carthoris chapter iii treachery the day following the coming of vas kor to the palace of the prince of helium great excitement reigned throughout the twin cities reaching its climax in the palace of carthoris word had come of the abduction of thuvia of ptarth from her father's court and with it the veiled hint that the prince of helium might be suspected of considerable knowledge of the act and the whereabouts of the princess in the council chamber of john carter warlord of mars was tardos mors jeddak of helium mors kajak his son jed of lesser helium carthoris and a score of the great nobles of the empire there must be no war between ptarth and helium my son said john carter that you are innocent of the charge that has been placed against you by insinuation we well know but thuvan dihn must know it well too there is but one who may convince him and that one be you you must hasten at once to the court of ptarth and by your presence there as well as by your words assure him that his suspicions are groundless bear with you the authority of the warlord of barsoom and of the jeddak of helium to offer every resource of the allied powers to assist thuvan dihn to recover his daughter and punish her abductors whomsoever they may be go i know that i do not need to urge upon you the necessity for haste carthoris left the council chamber and hastened to his palace here slaves were busy in a moment setting things to rights for the departure of their master several worked about the swift flier that would bear the prince of helium rapidly toward ptarth at last all was done but two armed slaves remained on guard the setting sun hung low above the horizon in a moment darkness would envelop all one of the guardsmen a giant of a fellow across whose right cheek there ran a thin scar from temple to mouth approached his companion his gaze was directed beyond and above his comrade when he had come quite close he spoke what strange craft is that he asked the other turned about quickly to gaze heavenward scarce was his back turned toward the giant than the short sword of the latter was plunged beneath his left shoulder blade straight through his heart voiceless the soldier sank in his tracks stone dead quickly the murderer dragged the corpse into the black shadows within the hangar then he returned to the flier drawing a cunningly wrought key from his pocket pouch he removed the cover of the right hand dial of the controlling destination compass for a moment he studied the construction of the mechanism beneath then he returned the dial to its place set the pointer and removed it again to note the resultant change in the position of the parts affected by the act a smile crossed his lips with a pair of cutters he snipped off the projection which extended through the dial from the external pointer now the latter might be moved to any point upon the dial without affecting the mechanism below in other words the eastern hemisphere dial was useless now he turned his attention to the western dial this he set upon a certain point afterward he removed the cover of this dial also and with keen tool cut the steel finger from the under side of the pointer as quickly as possible he replaced the second dial cover and resumed his place on guard to all intents and purposes the compass was as efficient as before but as a matter of fact the moving of the pointers upon the dials resulted now in no corresponding shift of the mechanism beneath and the device was set immovably upon a destination of the slave's own choosing presently came carthoris accompanied by but a handful of his gentlemen he cast but a casual glance upon the single slave who stood guard the fellow's thin cruel lips and the sword cut that ran from temple to mouth aroused the suggestion of an unpleasant memory within him he wondered where saran tal had found the man then the matter faded from his thoughts and in another moment the prince of helium was laughing and chatting with his companions though below the surface his heart was cold with dread for what contingencies confronted thuvia of ptarth he could not even guess first to his mind naturally had sprung the thought that astok of dusar had stolen the fair ptarthian but almost simultaneously with the report of the abduction had come news of the great fetes at dusar in honour of the return of the jeddak's son to the court of his father it could not have been he thought carthoris for on the very night that thuvia was taken astok had been in dusar and yet he entered the flier exchanging casual remarks with his companions as he unlocked the mechanism of the compass and set the pointer upon the capital city of ptarth with a word of farewell he touched the button which controlled the repulsive rays and as the flier rose lightly into the air the engine purred in answer to the touch of his finger upon a second button the propellers whirred as his hand drew back the speed lever and carthoris prince of helium was off into the gorgeous martian night beneath the hurtling moons and the million stars scarce had the flier found its speed ere the man wrapping his sleeping silks and furs about him stretched at full length upon the narrow deck to sleep but sleep did not come at once at his bidding instead his thoughts ran riot in his brain driving sleep away he recalled the words of thuvia of ptarth words that had half assured him that she loved him for when he had asked her if she loved kulan tith she had answered only that she was promised to him now he saw that her reply was open to more than a single construction it might of course mean that she did not love kulan tith and so by inference be taken to mean that she loved another but what assurance was there that the other was carthoris of helium the more he thought upon it the more positive he became that not only was there no assurance in her words that she loved him but none either in any act of hers no the fact was she did not love him she loved another she had not been abducted she had fled willingly with her lover with such pleasant thoughts filling him alternately with despair and rage carthoris at last dropped into the sleep of utter mental exhaustion the breaking of the sudden dawn found him still asleep his flier was rushing swiftly above a barren ochre plain the world old bottom of a long dead martian sea in the distance rose low hills toward these the craft was headed as it approached them a great promontory might have been seen from its deck stretching out into what had once been a mighty ocean and circling back once more to enclose the forgotten harbour of a forgotten city which still stretched back from its deserted quays an imposing pile of wondrous architecture of a long dead past the countless dismal windows vacant and forlorn stared sightless from their marble walls the whole sad city taking on the semblance of scattered mounds of dead men's sun bleached skulls the casements having the appearance of eyeless sockets the portals grinning jaws closer came the flier but now its speed was diminishing yet this was not ptarth above the central plaza it stopped slowly settling marsward within a hundred yards of the ground it came to rest floating gently in the light air and at the same instant an alarm sounded at the sleeper's ear carthoris sprang to his feet below him he looked to see the teeming metropolis of ptarth beside him already there should have been an air patrol he gazed about in bewildered astonishment there indeed was a great city but it was not ptarth no multitudes surged through its broad avenues no signs of life broke the dead monotony of its deserted roof tops no gorgeous silks no priceless furs lent life and colour to the cold marble and the gleaming ersite no patrol boat lay ready with its familiar challenge silent and empty lay the great city empty and silent the surrounding air what had happened carthoris examined the dial of his compass the pointer was set upon ptarth could the creature of his genius have thus betrayed him he would not believe it quickly he unlocked the cover turning it back upon its hinge a single glance showed him the truth or at least a part of it the steel projection that communicated the movement of the pointer upon the dial to the heart of the mechanism beneath had been severed who could have done the thing and why carthoris could not hazard even a faint guess but the thing now was to learn in what portion of the world he was and then take up his interrupted journey once more if it had been the purpose of some enemy to delay him he had succeeded well thought carthoris as he unlocked the cover of the second dial the first having shown that its pointer had not been set at all beneath the second dial he found the steel pin severed as in the other but the controlling mechanism had first been set for a point upon the western hemisphere he had just time to judge his location roughly at some place south west of helium and at a considerable distance from the twin cities when he was startled by a woman's scream beneath him leaning over the side of the flier he saw what appeared to be a red woman being dragged across the plaza by a huge green warrior one of those fierce cruel denizens of the dead sea bottoms and deserted cities of dying mars carthoris waited to see no more reaching for the control board he sent his craft racing plummet like toward the ground the green man was hurrying his captive toward a huge thoat that browsed upon the ochre vegetation of the once scarlet gorgeous plaza at the same instant a dozen red warriors leaped from the entrance of a nearby ersite palace pursuing the abductor with naked swords and shouts of rageful warning once the woman turned her face upward toward the falling flier and in the single swift glance carthoris saw that it was thuvia of ptarth chapter iv a green man's captive when the light of day broke upon the little craft to whose deck the princess of ptarth had been snatched from her father's garden thuvia saw that the night had wrought a change in her abductors no longer did their trappings gleam with the metal of dusar but instead there was emblazoned there the insignia of the prince of helium the girl felt renewed hope for she could not believe that in the heart of carthoris could lie intent to harm her she spoke to the warrior squatting before the control board last night you wore the trappings of a dusarian she said now your metal is that of helium what means it the man looked at her with a grin the prince of helium is no fool he said just then an officer emerged from the tiny cabin he reprimanded the warrior for conversing with the prisoner nor would he himself reply to any of her inquiries no harm was offered her during the journey and so they came at last to their destination with the girl no wiser as to her abductors or their purpose than at first here the flier settled slowly into the plaza of one of those mute monuments of mars dead and forgotten past the deserted cities that fringe the sad ochre sea bottoms where once rolled the mighty floods upon whose bosoms moved the maritime commerce of the peoples that are gone for ever thuvia of ptarth was no stranger to such places during her wanderings in search of the river iss that time she had set out upon what for countless ages had been the last long pilgrimage of martians toward the valley dor where lies the lost sea of korus she had encountered several of these sad reminders of the greatness and the glory of ancient barsoom and again during her flight from the temples of the holy therns with tars tarkas jeddak of thark she had seen them with their weird and ghostly inmates the great white apes of barsoom she knew too that many of them were used now by the nomadic tribes of green men but that among them all was no city that the red men did not shun for without exception they stood amidst vast waterless tracts unsuited for the continued sustenance of the dominant race of martians why then should they be bringing her to such a place there was but a single answer such was the nature of their work that they must needs seek the seclusion that a dead city afforded the girl trembled at thought of her plight for two days her captors kept her within a huge palace that even in decay reflected the splendour of the age which its youth had known just before dawn on the third day she had been aroused by the voices of two of her abductors he should be here by dawn one was saying have her in readiness upon the plaza else he will never land the moment he finds that he is in a strange country he will turn about methinks the prince's plan is weak in this one spot there was no other way replied the other it is wondrous work to get them both here at all and even if we do not succeed in luring him to the ground we shall have accomplished much just then the speaker caught the eyes of thuvia upon him revealed by the quick moving patch of light cast by thuria in her mad race through the heavens with a quick sign to the other he ceased speaking and advancing toward the girl motioned her to rise then he led her out into the night toward the centre of the great plaza stand here he commanded until we come for you we shall be watching and should you attempt to escape it will go ill with you much worse than death such are the prince's orders then he turned and retraced his steps toward the palace leaving her alone in the midst of the unseen terrors of the haunted city for in truth these places are haunted in the belief of many martians who still cling to an ancient superstition which teaches that the spirits of holy therns who die before their allotted one thousand years pass on occasions into the bodies of the great white apes to thuvia however the real danger of attack by one of these ferocious manlike beasts was quite sufficient she no longer believed in the weird soul transmigration that the therns had taught her before she was rescued from their clutches by john carter but she well knew the horrid fate that awaited her should one of the terrible beasts chance to spy her during its nocturnal prowlings what was that surely she could not be mistaken something had moved stealthily in the shadow of one of the great monoliths that line the avenue where it entered the plaza opposite her thar ban jed among the hordes of torquas rode swiftly across the ochre vegetation of the dead sea bottom toward the ruins of ancient aaanthor he had ridden far that night and fast for he had but come from the despoiling of the incubator of a neighbouring green horde with which the hordes of torquas were perpetually warring his giant thoat was far from jaded yet it would be well thought thar ban to permit him to graze upon the ochre moss which grows to greater height within the protected courtyards of deserted cities where the soil is richer than on the sea bottoms and the plants partly shaded from the sun during the cloudless martian day within the tiny stems of this dry seeming plant is sufficient moisture for the needs of the huge bodies of the mighty thoats which can exist for months without water and for days without even the slight moisture which the ochre moss contains as thar ban rode noiselessly up the broad avenue which leads from the quays of aaanthor to the great central plaza he and his mount might have been mistaken for spectres from a world of dreams so grotesque the man and beast so soundless the great thoat's padded nailless feet upon the moss grown flagging of the ancient pavement the man was a splendid specimen of his race fully fifteen feet towered his great height from sole to pate the moonlight glistened against his glossy green hide sparkling the jewels of his heavy harness and the ornaments that weighted his four muscular arms while the upcurving tusks that protruded from his lower jaw gleamed white and terrible at the side of his thoat were slung his long radium rifle and his great forty foot metal shod spear while from his own harness depended his long sword and his short sword as well as his lesser weapons his protruding eyes and antennae like ears were turning constantly hither and thither for thar ban was yet in the country of the enemy and too there was always the menace of the great white apes which john carter was wont to say are the only creatures that can arouse in the breasts of these fierce denizens of the dead sea bottoms even the remotest semblance of fear as the rider neared the plaza he reined suddenly in his slender tubular ears pointed rigidly forward an unwonted sound had reached them voices and where there were voices outside of torquas there too were enemies all the world of wide barsoom contained naught but enemies for the fierce torquasians thar ban dismounted keeping in the shadows of the great monoliths that line the avenue of quays of sleeping aaanthor he approached the plaza directly behind him as a hound at heel came the slate grey thoat his white belly shadowed by his barrel his vivid yellow feet merging into the yellow of the moss beneath them in the centre of the plaza thar ban saw the figure of a red"
