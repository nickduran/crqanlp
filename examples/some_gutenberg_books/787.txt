"1" "very angry at what he evidently considers his sister's mesalliance if mr stanhope is connected with the english stanhopes the mesalliance must be laid to his charge indeed the dennings have some pretenses to good lineage and bryce spoke of his sister disgracing his family by her contemplated marriage his family my dear ethel his grandfather was a manufacturer of tin tacks and now that we have got as far away as the denning's grandfather suppose we drop the subject content i am a little tired of the clan denning that is their original name dora says i will go now and dress for dinner then ruth rose and looked inquisitively around the room it was as she wished it to be the very expression of elegant comfort warm and light and holding the scent of roses a place of deep large chairs with no odds and ends to worry about a room to lounge and chat in and where the last touch of perfect home freedom was given by a big mastiff who having heard the door bell ring strolled in to see who had called chapter ii during dinner both ruth and ethel were aware of some sub interest in the judge's manner his absent mindedness was unusual and once ruth saw a faint smile that nothing evident could have induced unconsciously also he set a tone of constraint and hurry the meal was not loitered over the conversation flagged and all rose from the table with a sense of relief perhaps indeed with a feeling of expectation they entered the parlor together and the mastiff rose to meet them asking permission to remain with the little coaxing push of his nose which brought the ready answer certainly sultan make yourself comfortable then they grouped themselves round the fire and the judge lit his cigar and looked at ethel in a way that instantly brought curiosity to the question you have a secret father she said is it about grandmother it is news rather than a secret ethel and grandmother has a good deal to do with it for it is about her family the mostyns oh the tone of ethel's oh was not encouraging and ruth's look of interest held in abeyance was just as chilling but something like this attitude had been expected and judge rawdon was not discouraged by it he knew that youth is capable of great and sudden changes and that its ability to find reasonable motives for them is unlimited so he calmly continued you are aware that your grandmother's name before marriage was rachel mostyn i have seen it a thousand times at the bottom of her sampler father the one that is framed and hanging in her morning room rachel mostyn november anno domini 1827 very well she married george rawdon and they came to new york in 1834 they had a pretty house on the bowling green and lived very happily there i was born in 1850 the youngest of their children you know that i sign my name edward m rawdon it is really edward mostyn rawdon he paused and ruth said i suppose mrs rawdon has had some news from her old home she had a letter last night and i shall probably receive one to morrow frederick mostyn her grand nephew is coming to new york and squire rawdon of rawdon manor writes to recommend the young man to our hospitality but you surely do not intend to invite him here edward i think that would not do he is going to the holland house but he is our kinsman and therefore we must be hospitable i have been trying to count the kinship it is out of my reckoning said ethel i hope at least he is nice and presentable the mostyns are a handsome family look at your grandmother and squire rawdon speaks very well of mr mostyn he has taken the right side in politics and is likely to make his mark they were always great sportsmen and i dare say this representative of the family is a good looking fellow well mannered and perfectly dressed ethel laughed if his clothes fit him he will be an english wonder i have seen lots of englishmen they are all frights as to trousers and vests there was lord wycomb his broadcloths and satins and linen were marvels in quality but the make the girls hated to be seen walking with him and he would walk good for the constitution was his explanation for all his peculiarities the caylers were weary to death of them and yet said ruth they sang songs of triumph when lou cayler married him that was a different thing lou would make him get fits and stop wearing sloppy baggy arrangements and i do not suppose the english lord has now a single peculiarity left unless it be his constitutional walk that of course i have heard english babies get out of their cradles to take a constitutional during this tirade ruth had been thinking edward she asked why does squire rawdon introduce mr mostyn their relationship cannot be worth counting there you are wrong ruth he spoke with a little excitement englishmen never deny matrimonial relationships if they are worthy ones mostyn and rawdon are bound together by many a gold wedding ring we reckon such ties relationships squire raw don lost his son and his two grandsons a year ago perhaps this young man may eventually stand in their place the squire is nearly eighty years old he is the last of the english rawdons at least of our branch of it you suppose this mr mostyn may become squire of rawdon manor he may ruth but it is not certain there is a large mortgage on the manor oh both girls made the ejaculation at the same moment and in both voices there was the same curious tone of speculation it was a cry after truth apprehended but not realized mr rawdon remained silent he was debating with himself the advisability of further confidence but he came quickly to the conclusion that enough had been told for the present turning to ethel he said i suppose girls have a code of honor about their secrets is dora denning's extraordinary news shut up in it oh no father she is going to be married that is all that is enough who is the man reverend mr stanhope nonsense positively i never heard anything more ridiculous that saintly young priest why dora will be tired to death of him in a month and he poor fellow why poor fellow he is very much in love with her it is hard to understand st jerome's love pale with midnight prayer would be more believable than the butterfly dora goodness gracious the idea of that man being in love it pulls him down a bit i thought he never looked at a woman do you know him father as many people know him by good report i know that he is a clergyman who believes what he preaches i know a wall street broker who left st jude's church because mr stanhope's sermons on sunday put such a fine edge on his conscience that mondays were dangerous days for him to do business on and whatever wall street financiers think of the bible personally they do like a man who sticks to his colors and who holds intact the truth committed to him stanhope does this emphatically and he is so well trusted that if he wanted to build a new church he could get all the money necessary from wall street men in an hour and he is going to marry going to marry dora denning it is extraordinary news indeed ethel was a little offended at such unusual surprise i think you don't quite understand dora she said it will be mr stanhope's fault if she is not led in the right way for if he only loves and pets her enough he may do all he wishes with her i know i have both coaxed and ordered her for four years sometimes one way is best and sometimes the other how is a man to tell which way to take what do her parents think of the marriage they are pleased with it pleased with it then i have nothing more to say except that i hope they will not appeal to me on any question of divorce that may arise from such an unlikely marriage they are only lovers yet edward said ruth it is not fair or kind to even think of divorce my dear ruth the fashionable girl of today accepts marriage with the provision of divorce dora is hardly one of that set i hope she may keep out of it but marriage will give her many opportunities well i am sorry for the young priest he isn't fit to manage a woman like dora denning i am afraid he will get the worst of it i think you are very unkind father dora is my friend and i know her she is a girl of intense feelings and very affectionate and she has dissolved all her life and mind in mr stanhope's life and mind just as a lump of sugar is dissolved in water ruth laughed can you not find a more poetic simile ethel it will do this is an age of matter a material symbol is the proper thing i am glad to hear she has dissolved her mind in stanhope's said judge rawdon dora's intellect in itself is childish what did the man see in her that he should desire her father you never can tell how much brains men like with their beauty very little will do generally and dora has beauty great beauty no one can deny that i think dora is giving up a great deal to her at least marriage is a state of passing from perfect freedom into the comparative condition of a slave giving up her own way constantly for some one else's way well ethel the remedy is in the lady's hands she is not forced to marry and the slavery that is voluntary is no hardship now my dear i have a case to look over and you must excuse me to night to morrow we shall know more concerning mr mostyn and it is easier to talk about certainties than probabilities but if conversation ceased about mr mostyn thought did not for a couple of hours afterwards ethel tapped at her aunt's door and said just a moment ruth yes dear what is it did you notice what father said about the mortgage on rawdon manor yes he seemed to know all about it i think he does know all about it do you think he holds it he may do so it is not unlikely oh then mr fred mostyn if he is to inherit rawdon would like the mortgage removed of course he would and the way to remove it would be to marry the daughter of the holder of the mortgage it would be one way so he is coming to look me over i am a matrimonial possibility how do you like that idea aunt ruth i do not entertain it for a moment mr mostyn may not even know of the mortgage when men mortgage their estates they do not make confidences about the matter or talk it over with their friends they always conceal and hide the transaction if your father holds the mortgage i feel sure that no one but himself and squire rawdon know anything about it don't look at the wrong side of events ethel be content with the right side of life's tapestry why are you not asleep what are you worrying about nothing only i have not heard all i wanted to hear and perhaps that is good for you i shall go and see grandmother first thing in the morning i would not if i were you you cannot make any excuse she will not see through your father will call on mr mostyn to morrow and we shall get unprejudiced information oh i don't know that ruth father is intensely american three hundred and sixty four days and twenty three hours in a year and then in the odd hour he will flare up yorkshire like a conflagration english you mean no yorkshire is england to grandmother and father they don't think anything much of the other counties and people from them are just respectable foreigners you may depend upon it whatever grandmother says of mr fred mostyn father will believe it too your father always believes whatever your grandmother says good night dear good night i think i shall go to grandmother in the morning i know how to manage her i shall meet her squarely with the truth and acknowledge that i am dying with curiosity about mr mostyn and she will tease and lecture you say you are not sweetheart high yet only a little maid and so on far better go and talk with dora to morrow she will need you i am sure ethel i am very sleepy good night again dear good night then with a sudden animation i know what to do i shall tell grandmother about dora's marriage it is all plain enough now good night ruth and this good night though dropping sweetly into the minor third had yet on its final inflection something of the pleasant hopefulness of its major key it expressed anticipation and satisfaction what happened in the night session she could not tell but she awoke with a positive disinclination to ask a question about mr mostyn i have received orders from some one she said to ruth i simply do not care whether i ever see or hear of the man again i am going to dora and i may not come home until late you know they will depend upon me for every suggestion in fact ethel did not return home until the following day for a snowstorm came up in the afternoon and the girl was weary with planning and writing and well inclined to eat with dora the delicate little dinner served to them in dora's private parlor then about nine o'clock mr stanhope called and ethel found it pleasant enough to watch the lovers and listen to mrs denning's opinions of what had been already planned and the next day she seemed to be so absolutely necessary to the movement of the marriage preparations that it was nearly dark before she was permitted to return home it was but a short walk between the two houses and ethel was resolved to have the refreshment of the exercise and how good it was to feel the pinch of the frost and the gust of the north wind and after it to come to the happy portal of home and the familiar atmosphere of the cheerful hall and then to peep into the firelit room in which ruth lay dreaming in the dusky shadows ruth darling ethel i have just sent for you to come home then she rose and took ethel in her arms how delightfully cold you are and what rosy cheeks do you know that we have a little dinner party mr mostyn yes and your grandmother and perhaps dr fisher the doctor is not certain and i see that you are already dressed how handsome you look that black lace dress with the dull gold ornaments is all right i felt as if jewels would be overdress for a family dinner yes but jewels always snub men so completely it is not altogether that they represent money they give an air of royalty and a woman without jewels is like an uncrowned queen she does not get the homage i can't account for it but there it is i shall wear my sapphire necklace what did father say about our new kinsman very little it was impossible to judge from his words what he thought i fancied that he might have been a little disappointed i should not wonder we shall see you will be dressed in an hour in less time shall i wear white or blue pale blue and white flowers there are some white violets in the library i have a red rose we shall contrast each other very well what is it all about do we really care how we look in the eyes of this mr mostyn of course we care we should not be women if we did not care we must make some sort of an impression and naturally we prefer that it should be a pleasant one if we consider the mortgage nonsense the mortgage is not in it good by tell mattie to bring me a cup of tea upstairs i will be dressed in an hour the tea was brought and drank and ethel fell asleep while her maid prepared every item for her toilet then she spoke to her mistress and ethel awakened as she always did with a smile nature's surest sign of a radically sweet temper and everything went in accord with the smile her hair fell naturally into its most becoming waves her dress into its most graceful folds the sapphire necklace matched the blue of her happy eyes the roses of youth were on her cheeks and white violets on her breast she felt her own beauty and was glad of it and with a laughing word of pleasure went down to the parlor madam rawdon was standing before the fire but when she heard the door open she turned her face toward it come here ethel rawdon she said and let me have a look at you and ethel went to her side laid her hand lightly on the old lady's shoulder and kissed her cheek you do look middling well she continued and your dress is about as it should be i like a girl to dress like a girl still the sapphires are they necessary you would not say corals would you grandmother i have those you gave me when i was three years old keep your wit my dear for this evening i should not wonder but you might need it fred mostyn is rather better than i expected it was a great pleasure to see him it was like a bit of my own youth back again when you are a very old woman there are few things sweeter ethel but you are not an old woman grandmother nor was she in spite of her seventy five years she stood erect at the side of her grand daughter her abundant hair was partly gray but the gray mingled with the little oval of costly lace that lay upon it and the effect was soft and fair as powdering she had been very handsome and her beauty lingered as the beauty of some flowers linger in fainter tints and in less firm outlines for she had never fallen from that grace of god vouchsafed to children and therefore she had kept not only the enthusiasms of her youth but that sweet promise of the times of restitution when the child shall die one hundred years old because the child heart shall be kept in all its freshness and trust yes in rachel rawdon's heart the well springs of love and life lay too deep for the frosts of age to touch she would be eternally young before she grew old she sat down as ethel spoke and drew the girl to her side i hear your friend is going to marry she said dora yes are you sorry perhaps not dora has been a care to me for four years i hope her husband may manage her as well as i have done are you afraid he will not i cannot tell grandmother i see all dora's faults mr stanhope is certain that she has no faults hitherto she has had her own way in everything excepting myself no one has ventured to contradict her but then dora is over head and ears in love and love it is said makes all things easy to bear and to do one thing girls amazes me it is how readily women go to church and promise to love honor and obey their husbands when they never intend to do anything of the kind there is a still more amazing thing madam answered ruth that is that men should be so foolish as to think or hope they perhaps might do so old fashioned women used to manage it some way or other ruth but the old fashioned woman was a very soft hearted creature and maybe it was just as well that she was but woman's dark ages are nearly over madam and is not the new woman a great improvement on the old woman i haven't made up my mind yet ruth about the new woman i notice one thing that a few of the new kind have got into their pretty heads and that is that they ought to have been men and they have followed up that idea so far that there is now very little difference in their looks and still less in their walk they go stamping along with the step of an athlete and the stride of a peasant on fresh plowed fields it is the most hideous of walks imaginable the grecian bend which you cannot remember but may have heard of was a lackadaisical vulgar walking fad but it was grace itself compared with the hideous stride which the new woman has acquired on the golf links or somewhere else but men stamp and stride in the same way grandmother a long stride suits a man's anatomy well enough it does not suit a woman's she feels every stride she takes i'll warrant her if she plays golf my dear ethel there is no need for her to play golf it is a man's game and was played for centuries by men only in scotland the home of golf it was not thought nice for women to even go to the links because of the awful language they were likely to hear then grandmother is it not well for ladies to play golf if it keeps men from using awful language to each other god love you child men will think what they dare not speak if we could only have some new men sighed ethel the lover of to day is just what a girl can pick up he has no wit and no wisdom and no illusions he talks of his muscles and smells of cigarettes perhaps of whisky and at these words judge rawdon accompanied by mr fred mostyn entered the room the introductions slipped over easily they hardly seemed to be necessary and the young man took the chair offered as naturally as if he had sat by the hearth all his life there was no pause and no embarrassment and no useless polite platitudes and ethel's first feeling about her kinsman was one of admiration for the perfect ease and almost instinctive at homeness with which he took his place he had come to his own and his own had received him that was the situation a very pleasant one which he accepted with the smiling trust that was at once the most perfect and polite of acknowledgments so you do not enjoy traveling said judge rawdon as if continuing a conversation i think it the most painful way of taking pleasure sir that is the actual transit and sleeping cars and electric lighted steamers and hotels do not mitigate the suffering if dante was writing now he might depict a constant round of personally conducted tours in purgatory i should think the punishment adequate for any offense but i like arriving at places new york has given me a lot of new sensations to day and i have forgotten the transit troubles already he talked well and temperately and yet ethel could not avoid the conclusion that he was a man of positive character and uncompromising prejudices and she also felt a little disappointed in his personality which contradicted her ideal of a yorkshire squire for he was small and slender in stature and his face was keen and thin from the high cheek bones to the sharp point of the clean shaven chin yet it was an interesting face for the brows were broad and the eyes bright and glancing that his nature held the opposite of his qualities was evident from the mouth which was composed and discreet and generally clothed with a frank smile negatived by the deep sonorous voice which belongs to the indiscreet and quarrelsome his dress was perfect ethel could find no fault in it except the monocle which he did not use once during the evening and which she therefore decided was a quite idle and unhandsome adjunct one feature of his character was definite he was a home loving man he liked the society of women with whom he could be familiar and he preferred the company of books and music to fashionable social functions this pleasant habit of domesticity was illustrated during the evening by an accidental incident a noisy mechanical street organ stopped before the windows and in a blatant manner began its performance conversation was paralyzed by the intrusion and when it was removed judge rawdon said what a democratic leveling aggressive thing music is it insists on being heard it is always in the way it thrusts itself upon you whether you want it or not now art is different you go to see pictures when you wish to mostyn did not notice the criticism on music itself but added in a soft disapproving way that man has no music in him do you know that was one of mendelssohn's delicious dreams this is how it should have been rendered and he went impulsively to the piano and then the sweet monotonous cadences and melodious reveries slipped from his long white fingers till the whole room was permeated with a delicious sense of moonlit solitude and conversation was stilled in its languor the young man had played his own dismissal but it was an effective one and he complimented himself on his readiness to seize opportunities for display and on his genius in satisfying them i think i astonished them a little he mused and i wonder what that pretty cousin of mine thought of the music and the musician i fancy we shall be good friends she is proud that is no fault and she has very decided opinions which might be a great fault but i think i rather astonished them to such reflections he stepped rather pompously down the avenue not at all influenced by any premonition that his satisfactory feelings might be imperfectly shared yet silence was the first result of his departure judge rawdon took out his pocketbook and began to study its entries ruth bayard rose and closed the piano ethel lifted a magazine while it was madam who finally asked in an impatient tone what do you think of frederick i suppose edward you have an opinion isn't he a very clever man i should not wonder if he were mother clever to a fault i never heard a young man talk better he talked a great deal but then you know he was not on his oath i'll warrant every word he said your warrant is fine surety mother but i am not bound to believe all i hear you women can please yourselves and with these words he left the women to find out if they could what manner of man their newly found kinsman might be chapter iii one of the most comfortable things about frederick mostyn was his almost boyish delight in the new life which new york opened to him every phase of it was so fresh so unusual that his yorkshire existence at mostyn hall gave him no precedents and no experiences by which to measure events the simplest things were surprising or interesting he was never weary of taking those exciting lifts to the top of twenty three story buildings and admiring the wonderful views such altitudes gave him he did not perhaps comprehend how much he was influenced by the friction of two million wills and interests did not realize how they evoked an electric condition that got behind the foreground of existence and stirred something more at the roots of his being than any previous experience had ever done and this feeling was especially entrancing when he saw the great city and majestic river lying at his feet in the white uncanny light of electricity all its color gone its breath cold its life strangely remote and quiet men moving like shadows and sounds hollow and faint and far off as if they came from a distant world it gave him a sense of dreamland quite as much as that of reality the yorkshire moors and words grew dull and dreary in his memory even the thought of the hunting field could not lure his desire new york was full of marvelous novelties its daily routine even in the hotel and on the streets gripped his heart and his imagination and he confessed to himself that new york was life at first hand fresh drawn its very foam sparkling and intoxicating he walked from the park to the battery and examined all that caught his eye he had a history of the city and sought out every historical site he even went over to weehawken and did his best to locate the spot where burr and hamilton fought he"
