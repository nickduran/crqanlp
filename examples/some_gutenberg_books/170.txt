"1" "already known to him through the countess's confession as the lady deserted by lord montbarry her name was agnes lockwood she was described as being the superior of the countess in personal attraction and as being also by some years the younger woman of the two making all allowance for the follies that men committed every day in their relations with women montbarry's delusion was still the most monstrous delusion on record in this expression of opinion every man present agreed the lawyer even included not one of them could call to mind the innumerable instances in which the sexual influence has proved irresistible in the persons of women without even the pretension to beauty the very members of the club whom the countess in spite of her personal disadvantages could have most easily fascinated if she had thought it worth her while were the members who wondered most loudly at montbarry's choice of a wife while the topic of the countess's marriage was still the one topic of conversation a member of the club entered the smoking room whose appearance instantly produced a dead silence doctor wybrow's next neighbour whispered to him montbarry's brother henry westwick the new comer looked round him slowly with a bitter smile you are all talking of my brother he said don't mind me not one of you can despise him more heartily than i do go on gentlemen go on but one man present took the speaker at his word that man was the lawyer who had already undertaken the defence of the countess i stand alone in my opinion he said and i am not ashamed of repeating it in anybody's hearing i consider the countess narona to be a cruelly treated woman why shouldn't she be lord montbarry's wife who can say she has a mercenary motive in marrying him montbarry's brother turned sharply on the speaker i say it he answered the reply might have shaken some men the lawyer stood on his ground as firmly as ever i believe i am right he rejoined in stating that his lordship's income is not more than sufficient to support his station in life also that it is an income derived almost entirely from landed property in ireland every acre of which is entailed montbarry's brother made a sign admitting that he had no objection to offer so far if his lordship dies first the lawyer proceeded i have been informed that the only provision he can make for his widow consists in a rent charge on the property of no more than four hundred a year his retiring pension and allowances it is well known die with him four hundred a year is therefore all that he can leave to the countess if he leaves her a widow four hundred a year is not all was the reply to this my brother has insured his life for ten thousand pounds and he has settled the whole of it on the countess in the event of his death this announcement produced a strong sensation men looked at each other and repeated the three startling words ten thousand pounds driven fairly to the wall the lawyer made a last effort to defend his position may i ask who made that settlement a condition of the marriage he said surely it was not the countess herself henry westwick answered it was the countess's brother and added which comes to the same thing after that there was no more to be said so long at least as montbarry's brother was present the talk flowed into other channels and the doctor went home but his morbid curiosity about the countess was not set at rest yet in his leisure moments he found himself wondering whether lord montbarry's family would succeed in stopping the marriage after all and more than this he was conscious of a growing desire to see the infatuated man himself every day during the brief interval before the wedding he looked in at the club on the chance of hearing some news nothing had happened so far as the club knew the countess's position was secure montbarry's resolution to be her husband was unshaken they were both roman catholics and they were to be married at the chapel in spanish place so much the doctor discovered about them and no more on the day of the wedding after a feeble struggle with himself he actually sacrificed his patients and their guineas and slipped away secretly to see the marriage to the end of his life he was angry with anybody who reminded him of what he had done on that day the wedding was strictly private a close carriage stood at the church door a few people mostly of the lower class and mostly old women were scattered about the interior of the building here and there doctor wybrow detected the faces of some of his brethren of the club attracted by curiosity like himself four persons only stood before the altar the bride and bridegroom and their two witnesses one of these last was an elderly woman who might have been the countess's companion or maid the other was undoubtedly her brother baron rivar the bridal party the bride herself included wore their ordinary morning costume lord montbarry personally viewed was a middle aged military man of the ordinary type nothing in the least remarkable distinguished him either in face or figure baron rivar again in his way was another conventional representative of another well known type one sees his finely pointed moustache his bold eyes his crisply curling hair and his dashing carriage of the head repeated hundreds of times over on the boulevards of paris the only noteworthy point about him was of the negative sort he was not in the least like his sister even the officiating priest was only a harmless humble looking old man who went through his duties resignedly and felt visible rheumatic difficulties every time he bent his knees the one remarkable person the countess herself only raised her veil at the beginning of the ceremony and presented nothing in her plain dress that was worth a second look never on the face of it was there a less interesting and less romantic marriage than this from time to time the doctor glanced round at the door or up at the galleries vaguely anticipating the appearance of some protesting stranger in possession of some terrible secret commissioned to forbid the progress of the service nothing in the shape of an event occurred nothing extraordinary nothing dramatic bound fast together as man and wife the two disappeared followed by their witnesses to sign the registers and still doctor wybrow waited and still he cherished the obstinate hope that something worth seeing must certainly happen yet the interval passed and the married couple returning to the church walked together down the nave to the door doctor wybrow drew back as they approached to his confusion and surprise the countess discovered him he heard her say to her husband one moment i see a friend lord montbarry bowed and waited she stepped up to the doctor took his hand and wrung it hard he felt her overpowering black eyes looking at him through her veil one step more you see on the way to the end she whispered those strange words and returned to her husband before the doctor could recover himself and follow her lord and lady montbarry had stepped into their carriage and had driven away outside the church door stood the three or four members of the club who like doctor wybrow had watched the ceremony out of curiosity near them was the bride's brother waiting alone he was evidently bent on seeing the man whom his sister had spoken to in broad daylight his bold eyes rested on the doctor's face with a momentary flash of suspicion in them the cloud suddenly cleared away the baron smiled with charming courtesy lifted his hat to his sister's friend and walked off the members constituted themselves into a club conclave on the church steps they began with the baron damned ill looking rascal they went on with montbarry is he going to take that horrid woman with him to ireland not he he can't face the tenantry they know about agnes lockwood well but where is he going to scotland does she like that it's only for a fortnight they come back to london and go abroad and they will never return to england eh who can tell did you see how she looked at montbarry when she had to lift her veil at the beginning of the service in his place i should have bolted did you see her doctor by this time doctor wybrow had remembered his patients and had heard enough of the club gossip he followed the example of baron rivar and walked off one step more you see on the way to the end he repeated to himself on his way home what end chapter iv on the day of the marriage agnes lockwood sat alone in the little drawing room of her london lodgings burning the letters which had been written to her by montbarry in the bygone time the countess's maliciously smart description of her addressed to doctor wybrow had not even hinted at the charm that most distinguished agnes the artless expression of goodness and purity which instantly attracted everyone who approached her she looked by many years younger than she really was with her fair complexion and her shy manner it seemed only natural to speak of her as a girl although she was now really advancing towards thirty years of age she lived alone with an old nurse devoted to her on a modest little income which was just enough to support the two there were none of the ordinary signs of grief in her face as she slowly tore the letters of her false lover in two and threw the pieces into the small fire which had been lit to consume them unhappily for herself she was one of those women who feel too deeply to find relief in tears pale and quiet with cold trembling fingers she destroyed the letters one by one without daring to read them again she had torn the last of the series and was still shrinking from throwing it after the rest into the swiftly destroying flame when the old nurse came in and asked if she would see master henry meaning that youngest member of the westwick family who had publicly declared his contempt for his brother in the smoking room of the club agnes hesitated a faint tinge of colour stole over her face there had been a long past time when henry westwick had owned that he loved her she had made her confession to him acknowledging that her heart was given to his eldest brother he had submitted to his disappointment and they had met thenceforth as cousins and friends never before had she associated the idea of him with embarrassing recollections but now on the very day when his brother's marriage to another woman had consummated his brother's treason towards her there was something vaguely repellent in the prospect of seeing him the old nurse who remembered them both in their cradles observed her hesitation and sympathising of course with the man put in a timely word for henry he says he's going away my dear and he only wants to shake hands and say good bye this plain statement of the case had its effect agnes decided on receiving her cousin he entered the room so rapidly that he surprised her in the act of throwing the fragments of montbarry's last letter into the fire she hurriedly spoke first you are leaving london very suddenly henry is it business or pleasure instead of answering her he pointed to the flaming letter and to some black ashes of burnt paper lying lightly in the lower part of the fireplace are you burning letters yes his letters yes he took her hand gently i had no idea i was intruding on you at a time when you must wish to be alone forgive me agnes i shall see you when i return she signed to him with a faint smile to take a chair we have known one another since we were children she said why should i feel a foolish pride about myself in your presence why should i have any secrets from you i sent back all your brother's gifts to me some time ago i have been advised to do more to keep nothing that can remind me of him in short to burn his letters i have taken the advice but i own i shrank a little from destroying the last of the letters no not because it was the last but because it had this in it she opened her hand and showed him a lock of montbarry's hair tied with a morsel of golden cord well well let it go with the rest she dropped it into the flame for a while she stood with her back to henry leaning on the mantel piece and looking into the fire he took the chair to which she had pointed with a strange contradiction of expression in his face the tears were in his eyes while the brows above were knit close in an angry frown he muttered to himself damn him she rallied her courage and looked at him again when she spoke well henry and why are you going away i am out of spirits agnes and i want a change she paused before she spoke again his face told her plainly that he was thinking of her when he made that reply she was grateful to him but her mind was not with him her mind was still with the man who had deserted her she turned round again to the fire is it true she asked after a long silence that they have been married to day he answered ungraciously in the one necessary word yes did you go to the church he resented the question with an expression of indignant surprise go to the church he repeated i would as soon go to he checked himself there how can you ask he added in lower tones i have never spoken to montbarry i have not even seen him since he treated you like the scoundrel and the fool that he is she looked at him suddenly without saying a word he understood her and begged her pardon but he was still angry the reckoning comes to some men he said even in this world he will live to rue the day when he married that woman agnes took a chair by his side and looked at him with a gentle surprise is it quite reasonable to be so angry with her because your brother preferred her to me she asked henry turned on her sharply do you defend the countess of all the people in the world why not agnes answered i know nothing against her on the only occasion when we met she appeared to be a singularly timid nervous person looking dreadfully ill and being indeed so ill that she fainted under the heat of my room why should we not do her justice we know that she was innocent of any intention to wrong me we know that she was not aware of my engagement henry lifted his hand impatiently and stopped her there is such a thing as being too just and too forgiving he interposed i can't bear to hear you talk in that patient way after the scandalously cruel manner in which you have been treated try to forget them both agnes i wish to god i could help you to do it agnes laid her hand on his arm you are very good to me henry but you don't quite understand me i was thinking of myself and my trouble in quite a different way when you came in i was wondering whether anything which has so entirely filled my heart and so absorbed all that is best and truest in me as my feeling for your brother can really pass away as if it had never existed i have destroyed the last visible things that remind me of him in this world i shall see him no more but is the tie that once bound us completely broken am i as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved what do you think henry i can hardly believe it if you could bring the retribution on him that he has deserved henry westwick answered sternly i might be inclined to agree with you as that reply passed his lips the old nurse appeared again at the door announcing another visitor i'm sorry to disturb you my dear but here is little mrs ferrari wanting to know when she may say a few words to you agnes turned to henry before she replied you remember emily bidwell my favourite pupil years ago at the village school and afterwards my maid she left me to marry an italian courier named ferrari and i am afraid it has not turned out very well do you mind my having her in here for a minute or two henry rose to take his leave i should be glad to see emily again at any other time he said but it is best that i should go now my mind is disturbed agnes i might say things to you if i stayed here any longer which which are better not said now i shall cross the channel by the mail to night and see how a few weeks change will help me he took her hand is there anything in the world that i can do for you he asked very earnestly she thanked him and tried to release her hand he held it with a tremulous lingering grasp god bless you agnes he said in faltering tones with his eyes on the ground her face flushed again and the next instant turned paler than ever she knew his heart as well as he knew it himself she was too distressed to speak he lifted her hand to his lips kissed it fervently and without looking at her again left the room the nurse hobbled after him to the head of the stairs she had not forgotten the time when the younger brother had been the unsuccessful rival of the elder for the hand of agnes don't be down hearted master henry whispered the old woman with the unscrupulous common sense of persons in the lower rank of life try her again when you come back left alone for a few moments agnes took a turn in the room trying to compose herself she paused before a little water colour drawing on the wall which had belonged to her mother it was her own portrait when she was a child how much happier we should be she thought to herself sadly if we never grew up the courier's wife was shown in a little meek melancholy woman with white eyelashes and watery eyes who curtseyed deferentially and was troubled with a small chronic cough agnes shook hands with her kindly well emily what can i do for you the courier's wife made rather a strange answer i'm afraid to tell you miss is it such a very difficult favour to grant sit down and let me hear how you are going on perhaps the petition will slip out while we are talking how does your husband behave to you emily's light grey eyes looked more watery than ever she shook her head and sighed resignedly i have no positive complaint to make against him miss but i'm afraid he doesn't care about me and he seems to take no interest in his home i may almost say he's tired of his home it might be better for both of us miss if he went travelling for a while not to mention the money which is beginning to be wanted sadly she put her handkerchief to her eyes and sighed again more resignedly than ever i don't quite understand said agnes i thought your husband had an engagement to take some ladies to switzerland and italy that was his ill luck miss one of the ladies fell ill and the others wouldn't go without her they paid him a month's salary as compensation but they had engaged him for the autumn and winter and the loss is serious i am sorry to hear it emily let us hope he will soon have another chance it's not his turn miss to be recommended when the next applications come to the couriers office you see there are so many of them out of employment just now if he could be privately recommended she stopped and left the unfinished sentence to speak for itself agnes understood her directly you want my recommendation she rejoined why couldn't you say so at once emily blushed it would be such a chance for my husband she answered confusedly a letter inquiring for a good courier a six months engagement miss came to the office this morning it's another man's turn to be chosen and the secretary will recommend him if my husband could only send his testimonials by the same post with just a word in your name miss it might turn the scale as they say a private recommendation between gentlefolks goes so far she stopped again and sighed again and looked down at the carpet as if she had some private reason for feeling a little ashamed of herself agnes began to be rather weary of the persistent tone of mystery in which her visitor spoke if you want my interest with any friend of mine she said why can't you tell me the name the courier's wife began to cry i'm ashamed to tell you miss for the first time agnes spoke sharply nonsense emily tell me the name directly or drop the subject whichever you like best emily made a last desperate effort she wrung her handkerchief hard in her lap and let off the name as if she had been letting off a loaded gun lord montbarry agnes rose and looked at her you have disappointed me she said very quietly but with a look which the courier's wife had never seen in her face before knowing what you know you ought to be aware that it is impossible for me to communicate with lord montbarry i always supposed you had some delicacy of feeling i am sorry to find that i have been mistaken weak as she was emily had spirit enough to feel the reproof she walked in her meek noiseless way to the door i beg your pardon miss i am not quite so bad as you think me but i beg your pardon all the same she opened the door agnes called her back there was something in the woman's apology that appealed irresistibly to her just and generous nature come she said we must not part in this way let me not misunderstand you what is it that you expected me to do emily was wise enough to answer this time without any reserve my husband will send his testimonials miss to lord montbarry in scotland i only wanted you to let him say in his letter that his wife has been known to you since she was a child and that you feel some little interest in his welfare on that account i don't ask it now miss you have made me understand that i was wrong had she really been wrong past remembrances as well as present troubles pleaded powerfully with agnes for the courier's wife it seems only a small favour to ask she said speaking under the impulse of kindness which was the strongest impulse in her nature but i am not sure that i ought to allow my name to be mentioned in your husband's letter let me hear again exactly what he wishes to say emily repeated the words and then offered one of those suggestions which have a special value of their own to persons unaccustomed to the use of their pens suppose you try miss how it looks in writing childish as the idea was agnes tried the experiment if i let you mention me she said we must at least decide what you are to say she wrote the words in the briefest and plainest form i venture to state that my wife has been known from her childhood to miss agnes lockwood who feels some little interest in my welfare on that account reduced to this one sentence there was surely nothing in the reference to her name which implied that agnes had permitted it or that she was even aware of it after a last struggle with herself she handed the written paper to emily your husband must copy it exactly without altering anything she stipulated on that condition i grant your request emily was not only thankful she was really touched agnes hurried the little woman out of the room don't give me time to repent and take it back again she said emily vanished is the tie that once bound us completely broken am i as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved agnes looked at the clock on the mantel piece not ten minutes since those serious questions had been on her lips it almost shocked her to think of the common place manner in which they had already met with their reply the mail of that night would appeal once more to montbarry's remembrance of her in the choice of a servant two days later the post brought a few grateful lines from emily her husband had got the place ferrari was engaged for six months certain as lord montbarry's courier the second part chapter v after only one week of travelling in scotland my lord and my lady returned unexpectedly to london introduced to the mountains and lakes of the highlands her ladyship positively declined to improve her acquaintance with them when she was asked for her reason she answered with a roman brevity i have seen switzerland for a week more the newly married couple remained in london in the strictest retirement on one day in that week the nurse returned in a state of most uncustomary excitement from an errand on which agnes had sent her passing the door of a fashionable dentist she had met lord montbarry himself just leaving the house the good woman's report described him with malicious pleasure as looking wretchedly ill his cheeks are getting hollow my dear and his beard is turning grey i hope the dentist hurt him knowing how heartily her faithful old servant hated the man who had deserted her agnes made due allowance for a large infusion of exaggeration in the picture presented to her the main impression produced on her mind was an impression of nervous uneasiness if she trusted herself in the streets by daylight while lord montbarry remained in london how could she be sure that his next chance meeting might not be a meeting with herself she waited at home privately ashamed of her own undignified conduct for the next two days on the third day the fashionable intelligence of the newspapers announced the departure of lord and lady montbarry for paris on their way to italy mrs ferrari calling the same evening informed agnes that her husband had left her with all reasonable expression of conjugal kindness his temper being improved by the prospect of going abroad but one other servant accompanied the travellers lady montbarry's maid rather a silent unsociable woman so far as emily had heard her ladyship's brother baron rivar was already on the continent it had been arranged that he was to meet his sister and her husband at rome one by one the dull weeks succeeded each other in the life of agnes she faced her position with admirable courage seeing her friends keeping herself occupied in her leisure hours with reading and drawing leaving no means untried of diverting her mind from the melancholy remembrance of the past but she had loved too faithfully she had been wounded too deeply to feel in any adequate degree the influence of the moral remedies which she employed persons who met with her in the ordinary relations of life deceived by her outward serenity of manner agreed that miss lockwood seemed to be getting over her disappointment but an old friend and school companion who happened to see her during a brief visit to london was inexpressibly distressed by the change that she detected in agnes this lady was mrs westwick the wife of that brother of lord montbarry who came next to him in age and who was described in the peerage as presumptive heir to the title he was then away looking after his interests in some mining property which he possessed in america mrs westwick insisted on taking agnes back with her to her home in ireland come and keep me company while my husband is away my three little girls will make you their playfellow and the only stranger you will meet is the governess whom i answer for your liking beforehand pack up your things and i will call for you to morrow on my way to the train in those hearty terms the invitation was given agnes thankfully accepted it for three happy months she"
