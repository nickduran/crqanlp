against the desk and his long orator's jaw trembling with the effort of his avowal he seemed like a hideous parody of the fatherly old man she had always known marry you me she burst out with a scornful laugh was that what you came to ask me the other night what's come over you i wonder how long is it since you've looked at yourself in the glass she straightened herself insolently conscious of her youth and strength i suppose you think it would be cheaper to marry me than to keep a hired girl everybody knows you're the closest man in eagle county but i guess you're not going to get your mending done for you that way twice mr royall did not move while she spoke his face was ash coloured and his black eyebrows quivered as though the blaze of her scorn had blinded him when she ceased he held up his hand that'll do that'll about do he said he turned to the door and took his hat from the hat peg on the threshold he paused people ain't been fair to me from the first they ain't been fair to me he said then he went out a few days later north dormer learned with surprise that charity had been appointed librarian of the hatchard memorial at a salary of eight dollars a month and that old verena marsh from the creston almshouse was coming to live at lawyer royall's and do the cooking iii it was not in the room known at the red house as mr royall's office that he received his infrequent clients professional dignity and masculine independence made it necessary that he should have a real office under a different roof and his standing as the only lawyer of north dormer required that the roof should be the same as that which sheltered the town hall and the post office it was his habit to walk to this office twice a day morning and afternoon it was on the ground floor of the building with a separate entrance and a weathered name plate on the door before going in he stepped in to the post office for his mail usually an empty ceremony said a word or two to the town clerk who sat across the passage in idle state and then went over to the store on the opposite corner where carrick fry the storekeeper always kept a chair for him and where he was sure to find one or two selectmen leaning on the long counter in an atmosphere of rope leather tar and coffee beans mr royall though monosyllabic at home was not averse in certain moods to imparting his views to his fellow townsmen perhaps also he was unwilling that his rare clients should surprise him sitting clerkless and unoccupied in his dusty office at any rate his hours there were not much longer or more regular than charity's at the library the rest of the time he spent either at the store or in driving about the country on business connected with the insurance companies that he represented or in sitting at home reading bancroft's history of the united states and the speeches of daniel webster since the day when charity had told him that she wished to succeed to eudora skeff's post their relations had undefinably but definitely changed lawyer royall had kept his word he had obtained the place for her at the cost of considerable maneuvering as she guessed from the number of rival candidates and from the acerbity with which two of them orma fry and the eldest targatt girl treated her for nearly a year afterward and he had engaged verena marsh to come up from creston and do the cooking verena was a poor old widow doddering and shiftless charity suspected that she came for her keep mr royall was too close a man to give a dollar a day to a smart girl when he could get a deaf pauper for nothing but at any rate verena was there in the attic just over charity and the fact that she was deaf did not greatly trouble the young girl charity knew that what had happened on that hateful night would not happen again she understood that profoundly as she had despised mr royall ever since he despised himself still more profoundly if she had asked for a woman in the house it was far less for her own defense than for his humiliation she needed no one to defend her his humbled pride was her surest protection he had never spoken a word of excuse or extenuation the incident was as if it had never been yet its consequences were latent in every word that he and she exchanged in every glance they instinctively turned from each other nothing now would ever shake her rule in the red house on the night of her meeting with miss hatchard's cousin charity lay in bed her bare arms clasped under her rough head and continued to think of him she supposed that he meant to spend some time in north dormer he had said he was looking up the old houses in the neighbourhood and though she was not very clear as to his purpose or as to why anyone should look for old houses when they lay in wait for one on every roadside she understood that he needed the help of books and resolved to hunt up the next day the volume she had failed to find and any others that seemed related to the subject never had her ignorance of life and literature so weighed on her as in reliving the short scene of her discomfiture it's no use trying to be anything in this place she muttered to her pillow and she shrivelled at the vision of vague metropolises shining super nettletons where girls in better clothes than belle balch's talked fluently of architecture to young men with hands like lucius harney's then she remembered his sudden pause when he had come close to the desk and had his first look at her the sight had made him forget what he was going to say she recalled the change in his face and jumping up she ran over the bare boards to her washstand found the matches lit a candle and lifted it to the square of looking glass on the white washed wall her small face usually so darkly pale glowed like a rose in the faint orb of light and under her rumpled hair her eyes seemed deeper and larger than by day perhaps after all it was a mistake to wish they were blue a clumsy band and button fastened her unbleached night gown about the throat she undid it freed her thin shoulders and saw herself a bride in low necked satin walking down an aisle with lucius harney he would kiss her as they left the church she put down the candle and covered her face with her hands as if to imprison the kiss at that moment she heard mr royall's step as he came up the stairs to bed and a fierce revulsion of feeling swept over her until then she had merely despised him now deep hatred of him filled her heart he became to her a horrible old man the next day when mr royall came back to dinner they faced each other in silence as usual verena's presence at the table was an excuse for their not talking though her deafness would have permitted the freest interchange of confidences but when the meal was over and mr royall rose from the table he looked back at charity who had stayed to help the old woman clear away the dishes i want to speak to you a minute he said and she followed him across the passage wondering he seated himself in his black horse hair armchair and she leaned against the window indifferently she was impatient to be gone to the library to hunt for the book on north dormer see here he said why ain't you at the library the days you're supposed to be there the question breaking in on her mood of blissful abstraction deprived her of speech and she stared at him for a moment without answering who says i ain't there's been some complaints made it appears miss hatchard sent for me this morning charity's smouldering resentment broke into a blaze i know orma fry and that toad of a targatt girl and ben fry like as not he's going round with her the low down sneaks i always knew they'd try to have me out as if anybody ever came to the library anyhow somebody did yesterday and you weren't there yesterday she laughed at her happy recollection at what time wasn't i there yesterday i'd like to know round about four o'clock charity was silent she had been so steeped in the dreamy remembrance of young harney's visit that she had forgotten having deserted her post as soon as he had left the library who came at four o'clock miss hatchard did miss hatchard why she ain't ever been near the place since she's been lame she couldn't get up the steps if she tried she can be helped up i guess she was yesterday anyhow by the young fellow that's staying with her he found you there i understand earlier in the afternoon and he went back and told miss hatchard the books were in bad shape and needed attending to she got excited and had herself wheeled straight round and when she got there the place was locked so she sent for me and told me about that and about the other complaints she claims you've neglected things and that she's going to get a trained librarian charity had not moved while he spoke she stood with her head thrown back against the window frame her arms hanging against her sides and her hands so tightly clenched that she felt without knowing what hurt her the sharp edge of her nails against her palms of all mr royall had said she had retained only the phrase he told miss hatchard the books were in bad shape what did she care for the other charges against her malice or truth she despised them as she despised her detractors but that the stranger to whom she had felt herself so mysteriously drawn should have betrayed her that at the very moment when she had fled up the hillside to think of him more deliciously he should have been hastening home to denounce her short comings she remembered how in the darkness of her room she had covered her face to press his imagined kiss closer and her heart raged against him for the liberty he had not taken well i'll go she said suddenly i'll go right off go where she heard the startled note in mr royall's voice why out of their old library straight out and never set foot in it again they needn't think i'm going to wait round and let them say they've discharged me charity charity royall you listen he began getting heavily out of his chair but she waved him aside and walked out of the room upstairs she took the library key from the place where she always hid it under her pincushion who said she wasn't careful put on her hat and swept down again and out into the street if mr royall heard her go he made no motion to detain her his sudden rages probably made him understand the uselessness of reasoning with hers she reached the brick temple unlocked the door and entered into the glacial twilight i'm glad i'll never have to sit in this old vault again when other folks are out in the sun she said aloud as the familiar chill took her she looked with abhorrence at the long dingy rows of books the sheep nosed minerva on her black pedestal and the mild faced young man in a high stock whose effigy pined above her desk she meant to take out of the drawer her roll of lace and the library register and go straight to miss hatchard to announce her resignation but suddenly a great desolation overcame her and she sat down and laid her face against the desk her heart was ravaged by life's cruelest discovery the first creature who had come toward her out of the wilderness had brought her anguish instead of joy she did not cry tears came hard to her and the storms of her heart spent themselves inwardly but as she sat there in her dumb woe she felt her life to be too desolate too ugly and intolerable what have i ever done to it that it should hurt me so she groaned and pressed her fists against her lids which were beginning to swell with weeping i won't i won't go there looking like a horror she muttered springing up and pushing back her hair as if it stifled her she opened the drawer dragged out the register and turned toward the door as she did so it opened and the young man from miss hatchard's came in whistling iv he stopped and lifted his hat with a shy smile i beg your pardon he said i thought there was no one here charity stood before him barring his way you can't come in the library ain't open to the public wednesdays i know it's not but my cousin gave me her key miss hatchard's got no right to give her key to other folks any more'n i have i'm the librarian and i know the by laws this is my library the young man looked profoundly surprised why i know it is i'm so sorry if you mind my coming i suppose you came to see what more you could say to set her against me but you needn't trouble it's my library today but it won't be this time tomorrow i'm on the way now to take her back the key and the register young harney's face grew grave but without betraying the consciousness of guilt she had looked for i don't understand he said there must be some mistake why should i say things against you to miss hatchard or to anyone the apparent evasiveness of the reply caused charity's indignation to overflow i don't know why you should i could understand orma fry's doing it because she's always wanted to get me out of here ever since the first day i can't see why when she's got her own home and her father to work for her nor ida targatt neither when she got a legacy from her step brother on'y last year but anyway we all live in the same place and when it's a place like north dormer it's enough to make people hate each other just to have to walk down the same street every day but you don't live here and you don't know anything about any of us so what did you have to meddle for do you suppose the other girls'd have kept the books any better'n i did why orma fry don't hardly know a book from a flat iron and what if i don't always sit round here doing nothing till it strikes five up at the church who cares if the library's open or shut do you suppose anybody ever comes here for books what they'd like to come for is to meet the fellows they're going with if i'd let em but i wouldn't let bill sollas from over the hill hang round here waiting for the youngest targatt girl because i know him that's all even if i don't know about books all i ought to she stopped with a choking in her throat tremors of rage were running through her and she steadied herself against the edge of the desk lest he should see her weakness what he saw seemed to affect him deeply for he grew red under his sunburn and stammered out but miss royall i assure you i assure you his distress inflamed her anger and she regained her voice to fling back if i was you i'd have the nerve to stick to what i said the taunt seemed to restore his presence of mind i hope i should if i knew but i don't apparently something disagreeable has happened for which you think i'm to blame but i don't know what it is because i've been up on eagle ridge ever since the early morning i don't know where you've been this morning but i know you were here in this library yesterday and it was you that went home and told your cousin the books were in bad shape and brought her round to see how i'd neglected them young harney looked sincerely concerned was that what you were told i don't wonder you're angry the books are in bad shape and as some are interesting it's a pity i told miss hatchard they were suffering from dampness and lack of air and i brought her here to show her how easily the place could be ventilated i also told her you ought to have some one to help you do the dusting and airing if you were given a wrong version of what i said i'm sorry but i'm so fond of old books that i'd rather see them made into a bonfire than left to moulder away like these charity felt her sobs rising and tried to stifle them in words i don't care what you say you told her all i know is she thinks it's all my fault and i'm going to lose my job and i wanted it more'n anyone in the village because i haven't got anybody belonging to me the way other folks have all i wanted was to put aside money enough to get away from here sometime d'you suppose if it hadn't been for that i'd have kept on sitting day after day in this old vault of this appeal her hearer took up only the last question it is an old vault but need it be that's the point and it's my putting the question to my cousin that seems to have been the cause of the trouble his glance explored the melancholy penumbra of the long narrow room resting on the blotched walls the discoloured rows of books and the stern rosewood desk surmounted by the portrait of the young honorius of course it's a bad job to do anything with a building jammed against a hill like this ridiculous mausoleum you couldn't get a good draught through it without blowing a hole in the mountain but it can be ventilated after a fashion and the sun can be let in i'll show you how if you like the architect's passion for improvement had already made him lose sight of her grievance and he lifted his stick instructively toward the cornice but her silence seemed to tell him that she took no interest in the ventilation of the library and turning back to her abruptly he held out both hands look here you don't mean what you said you don't really think i'd do anything to hurt you a new note in his voice disarmed her no one had ever spoken to her in that tone oh what did you do it for then she wailed he had her hands in his and she was feeling the smooth touch that she had imagined the day before on the hillside he pressed her hands lightly and let them go why to make things pleasanter for you here and better for the books i'm sorry if my cousin twisted around what i said she's excitable and she lives on trifles i ought to have remembered that don't punish me by letting her think you take her seriously it was wonderful to hear him speak of miss hatchard as if she were a querulous baby in spite of his shyness he had the air of power that the experience of cities probably gave it was the fact of having lived in nettleton that made lawyer royall in spite of his infirmities the strongest man in north dormer and charity was sure that this young man had lived in bigger places than nettleton she felt that if she kept up her denunciatory tone he would secretly class her with miss hatchard and the thought made her suddenly simple it don't matter to miss hatchard how i take her mr royall says she's going to get a trained librarian and i'd sooner resign than have the village say she sent me away naturally you would but i'm sure she doesn't mean to send you away at any rate won't you give me the chance to find out first and let you know it will be time enough to resign if i'm mistaken her pride flamed into her cheeks at the suggestion of his intervening i don't want anybody should coax her to keep me if i don't suit he coloured too i give you my word i won't do that only wait till tomorrow will you he looked straight into her eyes with his shy grey glance you can trust me you know you really can all the old frozen woes seemed to melt in her and she murmured awkwardly looking away from him oh i'll wait v there had never been such a june in eagle county usually it was a month of moods with abrupt alternations of belated frost and mid summer heat this year day followed day in a sequence of temperate beauty every morning a breeze blew steadily from the hills toward noon it built up great canopies of white cloud that threw a cool shadow over fields and woods then before sunset the clouds dissolved again and the western light rained its unobstructed brightness on the valley on such an afternoon charity royall lay on a ridge above a sunlit hollow her face pressed to the earth and the warm currents of the grass running through her directly in her line of vision a blackberry branch laid its frail white flowers and blue green leaves against the sky just beyond a tuft of sweet fern uncurled between the beaded shoots of the grass and a small yellow butterfly vibrated over them like a fleck of sunshine this was all she saw but she felt above her and about her the strong growth of the beeches clothing the ridge the rounding of pale green cones on countless spruce branches the push of myriads of sweet fern fronds in the cracks of the stony slope below the wood and the crowding shoots of meadowsweet and yellow flags in the pasture beyond all this bubbling of sap and slipping of sheaths and bursting of calyxes was carried to her on mingled currents of fragrance every leaf and bud and blade seemed to contribute its exhalation to the pervading sweetness in which the pungency of pine sap prevailed over the spice of thyme and the subtle perfume of fern and all were merged in a moist earth smell that was like the breath of some huge sun warmed animal charity had lain there a long time passive and sun warmed as the slope on which she lay when there came between her eyes and the dancing butterfly the sight of a man's foot in a large worn boot covered with red mud oh don't she exclaimed raising herself on her elbow and stretching out a warning hand don't what a hoarse voice asked above her head don't stamp on those bramble flowers you dolt she retorted springing to her knees the foot paused and then descended clumsily on the frail branch and raising her eyes she saw above her the bewildered face of a slouching man with a thin sunburnt beard and white arms showing through his ragged shirt don't you ever see anything liff hyatt she assailed him as he stood before her with the look of a man who has stirred up a wasp's nest he grinned i seen you that's what i come down for down from where she questioned stooping to gather up the petals his foot had scattered he jerked his thumb toward the heights been cutting down trees for dan targatt charity sank back on her heels and looked at him musingly she was not in the least afraid of poor liff hyatt though he came from the mountain and some of the girls ran when they saw him among the more reasonable he passed for a harmless creature a sort of link between the mountain and civilized folk who occasionally came down and did a little wood cutting for a farmer when hands were short besides she knew the mountain people would never hurt her liff himself had told her so once when she was a little girl and had met him one day at the edge of lawyer royall's pasture they won't any of em touch you up there f'ever you was to come up but i don't s'pose you will he had added philosophically looking at her new shoes and at the red ribbon that mrs royall had tied in her hair charity had in truth never felt any desire to visit her birthplace she did not care to have it known that she was of the mountain and was shy of being seen in talk with liff hyatt but today she was not sorry to have him appear a great many things had happened to her since the day when young lucius harney had entered the doors of the hatchard memorial but none perhaps so unforeseen as the fact of her suddenly finding it a convenience to be on good terms with liff hyatt she continued to look up curiously at his freckled weather beaten face with feverish hollows below the cheekbones and the pale yellow eyes of a harmless animal i wonder if he's related to me she thought with a shiver of disdain is there any folks living in the brown house by the swamp up under porcupine she presently asked in an indifferent tone liff hyatt for a while considered her with surprise then he scratched his head and shifted his weight from one tattered sole to the other there's always the same folks in the brown house he said with his vague grin they're from up your way ain't they their name's the same as mine he rejoined uncertainly charity still held him with resolute eyes see here i want to go there some day and take a gentleman with me that's boarding with us he's up in these parts drawing pictures she did not offer to explain this statement it was too far beyond liff hyatt's limitations for the attempt to be worth making he wants to see the brown house and go all over it she pursued liff was still running his fingers perplexedly through his shock of straw colored hair is it a fellow from the city he asked yes he draws pictures of things he's down there now drawing the bonner house she pointed to a chimney just visible over the dip of the pasture below the wood the bonner house liff echoed incredulously yes you won't understand and it don't matter all i say is he's going to the hyatts in a day or two liff looked more and more perplexed bash is ugly sometimes in the afternoons she threw her head back her eyes full on hyatt's i'm coming too you tell him they won't none of them trouble you the hyatts won't what d'you want a take a stranger with you though i've told you haven't i you've got to tell bash hyatt he looked away at the blue mountains on the horizon then his gaze dropped to the chimney top below the pasture he's down there now yes he shifted his weight again crossed his arms and continued to survey the distant landscape well so long he said at last inconclusively and turning away he shambled up the hillside from the ledge above her he paused to call down i wouldn't go there a sunday then he clambered on till the trees closed in on him presently from high overhead charity heard the ring of his axe she lay on the warm ridge thinking of many things that the woodsman's appearance had stirred up in her she knew nothing of her early life and had never felt any curiosity about it only a sullen reluctance to explore the corner of her memory where certain blurred images lingered but all that had happened to her within the last few weeks had stirred her to the sleeping depths she had become absorbingly interesting to herself and everything that had to do with her past was illuminated by this sudden curiosity she hated more than ever the fact of coming from the mountain but it was no longer indifferent to her everything that in any way affected her was alive and vivid even the hateful things had grown interesting because they were a part of herself i wonder if liff hyatt knows who my mother was she mused and it filled her with a tremor of surprise to think that some woman who was once young and slight with quick motions of the blood like hers had carried her in her breast and watched her sleeping she had always thought of her mother"
