"1" "afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed sarcastically there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clay's health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him here anne spoke the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow very true very true what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherd's rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughter's but sir walter's remark was soon afterwards the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top in the name of heaven who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixty two forty replied sir basil forty and no more picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin's age nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him that accidentally hearing it was just as he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walter's concerns could not be kept a secret accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let and understanding his mr shepherd's connection with the owner he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant and who is admiral croft was sir walter's cold suspicious inquiry mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed added he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale hearty well looking man a little weather beaten to be sure but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready furnished house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral's family which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant he was a married man and without children the very state to be wished for a house was never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many children a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be continued he asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft's brother but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not hear the appeal i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer's man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed after waiting another moment you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne mr shepherd was all gratitude wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in the admiral's situation in life which was just high enough and not too high i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here chapter 4 he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkford he was at that time a remarkably fine young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste and feeling half the sum of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one troubles soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious youth killing dependence it must not be if by any fair interference of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother's love and mother's rights it would be prevented captain wentworth had no fortune he had been lucky in his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil it only added a dangerous character to himself he was brilliant he was headstrong lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror she deprecated the connexion in every light such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her father's ill will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it but it was not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up the belief of being prudent and self denying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment he had left the country in consequence a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance but not with a few months ended anne's share of suffering from it her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them she had been solicited when about two and twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir walter's and of good character and appearance and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father's house and settled so permanently near herself but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne's being tempted by some man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits they knew not each other's opinion either its constancy or its change on the one leading point of anne's conduct for the subject was never alluded to but anne at seven and twenty thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that over anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth's sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell's motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft's really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information of their short lived engagement that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature's having heard of it from him the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness chapter 5 on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft's seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell's and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality on the admiral's side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherd's assurances of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherd's clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the best looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be no harm in him reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others something occurred however to give her a different duty mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a day's health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath i cannot possibly do without anne was mary's reasoning and elizabeth's reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay this invitation of mary's removed all lady russell's difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clay's being engaged to go"
