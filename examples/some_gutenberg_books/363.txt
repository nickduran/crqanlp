"1" "only by painful effort finally came a time that they remained closed and the young chest rose and fell in the regular breathing of slumber the two ragged rat hearted creatures rose silently and picked their way half crouched among the sleepers sprawled between them and the oskaloosa kid in the hand of dopey charlie gleamed a bit of shiny steel and in his heart were fear and greed the fear was engendered by the belief that the youth might be an amateur detective dopey charlie had had one experience of such and he knew that it was easily possible for them to blunder upon evidence which the most experienced of operatives might pass over unnoticed and the loot bulging pockets furnished a sufficient greed motive in themselves beside the boy kneeled the man with the knife he did not raise his hand and strike a sudden haphazard blow instead he placed the point carefully though lightly above the victim's heart and then suddenly bore his weight upon the blade abigail prim always had been a thorn in the flesh of her stepmother a well meaning unimaginative ambitious and rather common woman coming into the prim home as house keeper shortly after the death of abigail's mother the second mrs prim had from the first looked upon abigail principally as an obstacle to be overcome she had tried to do right by her but she had never given the child what a child most needs and most craves love and understanding not loving abigail the house keeper could naturally not give her love and as for understanding her one might as reasonably have expected an adding machine to understand higher mathematics jonas prim loved his daughter there was nothing within reason that money could buy which he would not have given her for the asking but jonas prim's love as his life was expressed in dollar signs while the love which abigail craved is better expressed by any other means at the command of man being misunderstood and to all outward appearances of sentiment and affection unloved had not in any way embittered abigail's remarkably joyous temperament she made up for it in some measure by getting all the fun and excitement out of life which she could discover therein or invent through the medium of her own resourceful imagination but recently the first real sorrow had been thrust into her young life since the half forgotten mother had been taken from her the second mrs prim had decided that it was her duty to see that abigail having finished school and college was properly married as a matchmaker the second mrs prim was as a texas steer in a ten cent store it was nothing to her that abigail did not wish to marry anyone or that the man of mrs prim's choice had he been the sole surviving male in the universe would have still been as far from abigail's choice as though he had been an inhabitant of one of orion's most distant planets as a matter of fact abigail prim detested samuel benham because he represented to her everything in life which she shrank from age avoirdupois infirmity baldness stupidity and matrimony he was a prosaic old bachelor who had amassed a fortune by the simple means of inheriting three farms upon which an industrial city subsequently had been built necessity rather than foresight had compelled him to hold on to his property and six weeks of typhoid arriving and departing had saved him from selling out at a low figure the first time he found himself able to be out and attend to business he likewise found himself a wealthy man and ever since he had been growing wealthier without personal effort all of which is to render evident just how impossible a matrimonial proposition was samuel benham to a bright a beautiful a gay an imaginative young and a witty girl such as abigail prim who cared less for money than for almost any other desirable thing in the world nagged scolded reproached pestered threatened abigail had at last given a seeming assent to her stepmother's ambition and had forthwith been packed off on a two weeks visit to the sister of the bride groom elect after which mr benham was to visit oakdale as a guest of the prims and at a dinner for which cards already had been issued so sure was mrs jonas prim of her position of dictator of the prim menage the engagement was to be announced it was some time after dinner on the night of abigail's departure that mrs prim following a habit achieved by years of housekeeping set forth upon her rounds to see that doors and windows were properly secured for the night a french window and its screen opening upon the verandah from the library she found open the house will be full of mosquitoes she ejaculated mentally as she closed them both with a bang and made them fast i should just like to know who left them open upon my word i don't know what would become of this place if it wasn't for me of all the shiftlessness and she turned and flounced upstairs in abigail's room she flashed on the center dome light from force of habit although she knew that the room had been left in proper condition after the girl's departure earlier in the day the first thing amiss that her eagle eye noted was the candlestick lying on the floor beside the dressing table as she stooped to pick it up she saw the open drawer from which the small automatic had been removed and then suspicions suddenly aroused as suddenly became fear and mrs prim almost dove across the room to the hidden wall safe a moment's investigation revealed the startling fact that the safe was unlocked and practically empty it was then that mrs jonas prim screamed her scream brought jonas and several servants upon the scene a careful inspection of the room disclosed the fact that while much of value had been ignored the burglar had taken the easily concealed contents of the wall safe which represented fully ninety percentum of the value of the personal property in abigail prim's apartments mrs prim scowled suspiciously upon the servants who else indeed could have possessed the intimate knowledge which the thief had displayed mrs prim saw it all the open library window had been but a clever blind to hide the fact that the thief had worked from the inside and was now doubtless in the house at that very moment jonas she directed call the police at once and see that no one absolutely no one leaves this house until they have been here and made a full investigation shucks pudgy exclaimed mr prim you don't think the thief is waiting around here for the police do you i think that if you get the police here at once jonas we shall find both the thief and the loot under our very roof she replied not without asperity you don't mean he hesitated why pudgy you don't mean you suspect one of the servants who else could have known asked mrs prim the servants present looked uncomfortable and cast sheepish eyes of suspicion at one another it's all tommy rot ejaculated mr prim but i'll call the police because i got to report the theft it's some slick outsider that's who it is and he started down stairs toward the telephone before he reached it the bell rang and when he had hung up the receiver after the conversation the theft seemed a trivial matter in fact he had almost forgotten it for the message had been from the local telegraph office relaying a wire they had just received from mr samuel benham i say pudgy he cried as he took the steps two at a time for the second floor here's a wire from benham saying gail didn't come on that train and asking when he's to expect her impossible ejaculated mrs prim i certainly saw her aboard the train myself impossible jonas prim was a man of action within half an hour he had set in motion such wheels as money and influence may cause to revolve in search of some clew to the whereabouts of the missing abigail and at the same time had reported the theft of jewels and money from his home but in doing this he had learned that other happenings no less remarkable in their way had taken place in oakdale that very night the following morning all oakdale was thrilled as its fascinated eyes devoured the front page of oakdale's ordinarily dull daily never had oakdale experienced a plethora of home grown thrills but it came as near to it that morning doubtless as it ever had or ever will not since the cashier of the merchants and farmers bank committed suicide three years past had oakdale been so wrought up and now that historic and classical event paled into insignificance in the glaring brilliancy of a series of crimes and mysteries of a single night such as not even the most sanguine of oakdale's thrill lovers could have hoped for there was first the mysterious disappearance of abigail prim the only daughter of oakdale's wealthiest citizen there was the equally mysterious robbery of the prim home either one of these would have been sufficient to have set oakdale's multitudinous tongues wagging for days but they were not all old john baggs the city's best known miser had suffered a murderous assault in his little cottage upon the outskirts of town and was even now lying at the point of death in the samaritan hospital that robbery had been the motive was amply indicated by the topsy turvy condition of the contents of the three rooms which baggs called home as the victim still was unconscious no details of the crime were obtainable yet even this atrocious deed had been capped by one yet more hideous reginald paynter had for years been looked upon half askance and yet with a certain secret pride by oakdale he was her sole bon vivant in the true sense of the word whatever that may be he was always spoken of in the columns of the oakdale tribune as that well known man about town or one of oakdale's most prominent clubmen reginald paynter had been if not the only at all events the best dressed man in town his clothes were made in new york this in itself had been sufficient to have set him apart from all the other males of oakdale he was widely travelled had an independent fortune and was far from unhandsome for years he had been the hope and despair of every oakdale mother with marriageable daughters the oakdale fathers however had not been so keen about reginald men usually know more about the morals of men than do women there were those who if pressed would have conceded that reginald had no morals but what place has an obituary in a truthful tale of adventure and mystery reginald paynter was dead his body had been found beside the road just outside the city limits at mid night by a party of automobilists returning from a fishing trip the skull was crushed back of the left ear the position of the body as well as the marks in the road beside it indicated that the man had been hurled from a rapidly moving automobile the fact that his pockets had been rifled led to the assumption that he had been killed and robbed before being dumped upon the road now there were those in oakdale and they were many who endeavored to connect in some way these several events of horror mystery and crime in the first place it seemed quite evident that the robbery at the prim home the assault upon old baggs and the murder of paynter had been the work of the same man but how could such a series of frightful happenings be in any way connected with the disappearance of abigail prim of course there were many who knew that abigail and reginald were old friends and that the former had on frequent occasions ridden abroad in reginald's french roadster that he had escorted her to parties and been at various times a caller at her home but no less had been true of a dozen other perfectly respectable young ladies of oakdale possibly it was only abigail's added misfortune to have disappeared upon the eve of the night of reginald's murder but later in the day when word came from a nearby town that reginald had been seen in a strange touring car with two unknown men and a girl the gossips commenced to wag their heads it was mentioned casually of course that this town was a few stations along the very road upon which abigail had departed the previous afternoon for that destination which she had not reached it was likewise remarked that reginald the two strange men and the girl had been first noticed after the time of arrival of the oakdale train what more was needed absolutely nothing more the tongues ceased wagging in order that they might turn hand springs find abigail prim whispered some and the mystery will be solved there were others charitable enough to assume that abigail had been kidnapped by the same men who had murdered paynter and wrought the other lesser deeds of crime in peaceful oakdale the oakdale tribune got out an extra that afternoon giving a resume of such evidence as had appeared in the regular edition and hinting at all the numerous possibilities suggested by such matter as had come to hand since even fear of old jonas prim and his millions had not been enough to entirely squelch the newspaper instinct of the tribune's editor never before had he had such an opportunity and he made the best of it even repeating the vague surmises which had linked the name of abigail to the murder of reginald paynter jonas prim was too busy and too worried to pay any attention to the tribune or its editor he already had the best operative that the best detective agency in the nearest metropolis could furnish the man had come to oakdale learned all that was to be learned there and forthwith departed this then will be about all concerning oakdale for the present we must leave her to bury her own dead the sudden pressure of the knife point against the breast of the oskaloosa kid awakened the youth with a startling suddenness which brought him to his feet before a second vicious thrust reached him for a time he did not realize how close he had been to death or that he had been saved by the chance location of the automatic pistol in his breast pocket the very pistol he had taken from the dressing table of abigail prim's boudoir the commotion of the attack and escape brought the other sleepers to heavy eyed wakefulness they saw dopey charlie advancing upon the kid a knife in his hand behind him slunk the general urging the other on the youth was backing toward the doorway the tableau persisted but for an instant then the would be murderer rushed madly upon his victim the latter's hand leaped from beneath the breast of his torn coat there was a flash of flame a staccato report and dopey charlie crumpled to the ground screaming in the same instant the oskaloosa kid wheeled and vanished into the night it had all happened so quickly that the other members of the gang awakened from deep slumber had only time to stumble to their feet before it was over the sky pilot ignoring the screaming charlie thought only of the loot which had vanished with the oskaloosa kid come on we gotta get him he cried as he ran from the barn after the fugitive the others all but dopey charlie followed in the wake of their leader the wounded man his audience departed ceased screaming and sitting up fell to examining himself to his surprise he discovered that he was not dead a further and more minute examination disclosed the additional fact that he was not even badly wounded the bullet of the kid had merely creased the flesh over the ribs beneath his right arm with a grunt that might have been either disgust or relief he stumbled to his feet and joined in the pursuit down the road toward the south ran the oskaloosa kid with all the fleetness of youth spurred on by terror in five minutes he had so far outdistanced his pursuers that the sky pilot leaped to the conclusion that the quarry had left the road to hide in an adjoining field the resultant halt and search upon either side of the road delayed the chase to a sufficient extent to award the fugitive a mile lead by the time the band resumed the hunt along the main highway the men were determined to overhaul the youth not alone because of the loot upon his person but through an abiding suspicion that he might indeed be what some of them feared he was an amateur detective and there were at least two among them who had reason to be especially fearful of any sort of detective from oakdale they no longer ran but puffed arduously along the smooth road searching with troubled and angry eyes to right and left and ahead of them as they went the oskaloosa kid puffed too but he puffed a mile away from the searchers and he walked more rapidly than they for his muscles were younger and his wind unimpaired by dissipation for a time he carried the small automatic in his hand but later hearing no evidence of pursuit he returned it to the pocket in his coat where it had lain when it had saved him from death beneath the blade of the degenerate charlie for an hour he continued walking rapidly along the winding country road he was very tired but he dared not pause to rest always behind him he expected the sudden onslaught of the bearded blear eyed followers of the sky pilot terror goaded him to supreme physical effort recollection of the screaming man sinking to the earthen floor of the hay barn haunted him he was a murderer he had slain a fellow man he winced and shuddered increasing his gait until again he almost ran ran from the ghost pursuing him through the black night in greater terror than he felt for the flesh and blood pursuers upon his heels and nature drew upon her sinister forces to add to the fear which the youth already felt black clouds obscured the moon blotting out the soft kindliness of the greening fields and transforming the budding branches of the trees to menacing and gloomy arms which appeared to hover with clawlike talons above the dark and forbidding road the wind soughed with gloomy and increasing menace a sudden light flared across the southern sky followed by the reverberation of distant thunder presently a great rain drop was blown against the youth's face the vividness of the lightning had increased the rumbling of the thunder had grown to the proportions of a titanic bombardment but he dared not pause to seek shelter another flash of lightning revealed a fork in the road immediately ahead to the left ran the broad smooth highway to the right a dirt road overarched by trees led away into the impenetrable dark the fugitive paused undecided which way should he turn the better travelled highway seemed less mysterious and awesome yet would his pursuers not naturally assume that he had followed it then of course the right hand road was the road for him yet still he hesitated for the right hand road was black and forbidding suggesting the entrance to a pit of unknown horrors as he stood there with the rain and the wind the thunder and the lightning horror of the past and terror of the future his only companions there broke suddenly through the storm the voice of a man just ahead and evidently approaching along the highway the youth turned to flee but the thought of the men tracking him from that direction brought him to a sudden halt there was only the road to the right then after all cautiously he moved toward it and at the same time the words of the voice came clearly through the night as swinging heel and toe we tramped the road to anywhere the magic road to anywhere the tragic road to anywhere such dear dim years ago the voice seemed reassuring its quality and the annunciation of the words bespoke for its owner considerable claim to refinement the youth had halted again but he now crouched to one side fearing to reveal his presence because of the bloody crime he thought he had committed yet how he yearned to throw himself upon the compassion of this fine voiced stranger how his every fibre cried out for companionship in this night of his greatest terror but he would have let the invisible minstrel pass had not fate ordained to light the scene at that particular instant with a prolonged flare of sheet lightning revealing the two wayfarers to one another the youth saw a slight though well built man in ragged clothes and disreputable soft hat the image was photographed upon his brain for life the honest laughing eyes the well moulded features harmonizing so well with the voice and the impossible garments which marked the man hobo and bum as plainly as though he wore a placard suspended from his neck the stranger halted once more darkness enveloped them lovely evening for a stroll remarked the man running out to your country place isn't there danger of skidding on these wet roads at night i told james just before we started to be sure to see that the chains were on all around but he forgot them james is very trying sometimes now he never showed up this evening and i had to start out alone and he knows perfectly well that i detest driving after dark in the rain the youth found himself smiling his fear had suddenly vanished no one could harbor suspicion of the owner of that cheerful voice i didn't know which road to take he ventured in explanation of his presence at the cross road oh exclaimed the man are there two roads here i was looking for this fork and came near passing it in the dark it was a year ago since i came this way but i recall a deserted house about a mile up the dirt road it will shelter us from the inclemencies of the weather oh cried the youth now i know where i am in the dark and the storm and after all that has happened to me tonight nothing seemed natural it was just as though i was in some strange land but i know now yes there is a deserted house a little less than a mile from here but you wouldn't want to stop there at night they tell some frightful stories about it it hasn't been occupied for over twenty years not since the squibbs were found murdered there the father mother three sons and a daughter they never discovered the murderer and the house has stood vacant and the farm unworked almost continuously since a couple of men tried working it but they didn't stay long a night or so was enough for them and their families i remember hearing as a little er child stories of the frightful things that happened there in the house where the squibbs were murdered things that happened after dark when the lights were out oh i wouldn't even pass that place on a night like this the man smiled i slept there alone one rainy night about a year ago he said i didn't see or hear anything unusual such stories are ridiculous and even if there was a little truth in them noises can't harm you as much as sleeping out in the storm i'm going to encroach once more upon the ghostly hospitality of the squibbs better come with me the youth shuddered and drew back from far behind came faintly the shout of a man yes i'll go exclaimed the boy let's hurry and he started off at a half run toward the dirt road the man followed more slowly the darkness hid the quizzical expression of his eyes he too had heard the faint shout far to the rear he recalled the boy's after all that has happened to me tonight and he shrewdly guessed that the latter's sudden determination to brave the horrors of the haunted house was closely connected with the hoarse voice out of the distance when he had finally come abreast of the youth after the latter his first panic of flight subsided had reduced his speed he spoke to him in his kindly tones what was it that happened to you to night he asked is someone following you you needn't be afraid of me i'll help you if you've been on the square if you haven't you still needn't fear me for i won't peach on you what is it tell me the youth was on the point of unburdening his soul to this stranger with the kindly voice and the honest eyes but a sudden fear stayed his tongue if he told all it would be necessary to reveal certain details that he could not bring himself to reveal to anyone and so he commenced with his introduction to the wayfarers in the deserted hay barn briefly he told of the attack upon him of his shooting of dopey charlie of the flight and pursuit and now he said in conclusion that you know i'm a murderer i suppose you won't have any more to do with me unless you turn me over to the authorities to hang there was almost a sob in his voice so real was his terror the man threw an arm across his companion's shoulder don't worry kid he said you're not a murderer even if you did kill dopey charlie which i hope you did you're a benefactor of the human race i have known charles for years he should have been killed long since furthermore as you shot in self defence no jury would convict you i fear however that you didn't kill him you say you could hear his screams as long as you were within earshot of the barn dead men don't scream you know how did you know my name asked the youth i don't replied the man but you called me kid and that's my name i'm the oskaloosa kid the man was glad that the darkness hid his smile of amusement he knew the oskaloosa kid well and he knew him as an ex pug with a pock marked face a bullet head and a tin ear the flash of lightning had revealed upon the contrary a slender boy with smooth skin an oval face and large dark eyes ah he said so you are the oskaloosa kid i am delighted sir to make your acquaintance permit me to introduce myself my name is bridge if james were here i should ask him to mix one of his famous cocktails that we might drink to our mutual happiness and the longevity of our friendship i am glad to know you mr bridge said the youth oh i can't tell you how glad i am to know you i was so lonely and so afraid and he pressed closer to the older man whose arm still encircled his shoulder though at first he had been inclined to draw away in some confusion talking together the two moved on along the dark road the storm had settled now into a steady rain with infrequent flashes of lightning and peals of thunder there had been no further indications of pursuit but bridge argued that the sky pilot being wise with the wisdom of the owl and cunning with the cunning of the fox would doubtless surmise that a fugitive would take to the first road leading away from the main artery and that even though they heard nothing it would be safe to assume that the gang was still upon the boy's trail and it's a bad bunch too he continued i've known them all for years the sky pilot has the reputation of never countenancing a murder but that is because he is a sly one his gang kills but when they kill under the sky pilot they do it so cleverly that no trace of the crime remains their victim disappears that is all the boy trembled you won't let them get me he pleaded pressing closer to the man the only response was a pressure of the arm about the shoulders of the oskaloosa kid over a low hill they followed the muddy road and down into a dark and gloomy ravine in a little open space to the right of the road a flash of lightning revealed the outlines of a building a hundred yards from the rickety and decaying fence which bordered the squibbs farm and separated it from the road here we are cried bridge and spooks or no spooks we'll find a dry spot in that old ruin there was a stove there last year and it's doubtless there yet a good fire to dry our clothes and warm us up will fit us for a bully good sleep and i'll wager a"
