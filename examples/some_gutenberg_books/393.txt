meant to fling him into the sea _through_ the bulwarks next moment mr button was in the boat emmeline was handed to him pale of face and wide eyed and clasping something wrapped in a little shawl then dick and then mr lestrange was helped over no room for more cried le farge your place will be in the long boat mrs stannard if we have to leave the ship lower away lower away the boat sank towards the smooth blue sea kissed it and was afloat now mr button before joining the ship at boston had spent a good while lingering by the quay having no money wherewith to enjoy himself in a tavern he had seen something of the lading of the _northumberland_ and heard more from a stevedore no sooner had he cast off the falls and seized the oars than his knowledge awoke in his mind living and lurid he gave a whoop that brought the two sailors leaning over the side bullies ay ay run for your lives i’ve just rimimbered there’s two bar’ls of blastin powther in the hould then he bent to his oars as no man ever bent before lestrange sitting in the stern sheets clasping emmeline and dick saw nothing for a moment after hearing these words the children who knew nothing of blasting powder or its effects though half frightened by all the bustle and excitement were still amused and pleased at finding themselves in the little boat so close to the blue pretty sea dick put his finger over the side so that it made a ripple in the water the most delightful experience of childhood emmeline with one hand clasped in her uncle’s watched mr button with a grave sort of half pleasure he certainly was a sight worth watching his soul was filled with tragedy and terror his celtic imagination heard the ship blowing up saw himself and the little dinghy blown to pieces nay saw himself in hell being toasted by divils but tragedy and terror could find no room for expression on his fortunate or unfortunate face he puffed and he blew bulging his cheeks out at the sky as he tugged at the oars making a hundred and one grimaces all the outcome of agony of mind but none expressing it behind lay the ship a picture not without its lighter side the long boat and the quarter boat lowered with a rush and seaborne by the mercy of providence were floating by the side of the _northumberland_ from the ship men were casting themselves overboard like water rats swimming in the water like ducks scrambling on board the boats anyhow from the half opened main hatch the black smoke mixed now with sparks rose steadily and swiftly and spitefully as if driven through the half closed teeth of a dragon a mile away beyond the _northumberland_ stood the fog bank it looked solid like a vast country that had suddenly and strangely built itself on the sea a country where no birds sang and no trees grew a country with white precipitous cliffs solid to look at as the cliffs of dover i’m spint suddenly gasped the oarsman resting the oar handles under the crook of his knees and bending down as if he was preparing to butt at the passengers in the stern sheets blow up or blow down i’m spint don’t ax me i’m spint mr lestrange white as a ghost but recovered somewhat from his first horror gave the spent one time to recover himself and turned to look at the ship she seemed a great distance off and the boats well away from her were making at a furious pace towards the dinghy dick was still playing with the water but emmeline’s eyes were entirely occupied with paddy button new things were always of vast interest to her contemplative mind and these evolutions of her old friend were eminently new she had seen him swilling the decks she had seen him dancing a jig she had seen him going round the main deck on all fours with dick on his back but she had never seen him going on like this before she perceived now that he was exhausted and in trouble about something and putting her hand in the pocket of her dress she searched for something that she knew was there she produced a tangerine orange and leaning forward she touched the spent one’s head with it mr button raised his head stared vacantly for a second saw the proffered orange and at the sight of it the thought of the childer and their innocence himself and the blasting powder cleared his dazzled wits and he took to the sculls again daddy said dick who had been looking astern there’s clouds near the ship in an incredibly short space of time the solid cliffs of fog had broken the faint wind that had banked it had pierced it and was now making pictures and devices of it most wonderful and weird to see horsemen of the mist rode on the water and were dissolved billows rolled on the sea yet were not of the sea blankets and spirals of vapour ascended to high heaven and all with a terrible languor of movement vast and lazy and sinister yet steadfast of purpose as fate or death the fog advanced taking the world for its own against this grey and indescribably sombre background stood the smouldering ship with the breeze already shivering in her sails and the smoke from her main hatch blowing and beckoning as if to the retreating boats why’s the ship smoking like that asked dick and look at those boats coming when are we going back daddy uncle said emmeline putting her hand in his as she gazed towards the ship and beyond it i’m fraid what frightens you emmy he asked drawing her to him shapes replied emmeline nestling up to his side oh glory be to god gasped the old sailor suddenly resting on his oars will yiz look at the fog that’s comin i think we had better wait here for the boats said mr lestrange we are far enough now to be safe if anything happens ay ay replied the oarsman whose wits had returned blow up or blow down she won’t hit us from here daddy said dick when are we going back i want my tea we aren’t going back my child replied his father the ship’s on fire we are waiting for another ship where’s the other ship asked the child looking round at the horizon that was clear we can’t see it yet replied the unhappy man but it will come the long boat and the quarter boat were slowly approaching they looked like beetles crawling over the water and after them across the glittering surface came a dullness that took the sparkle from the sea a dullness that swept and spread like an eclipse shadow now the wind struck the dinghy it was like a wind from fairyland almost imperceptible chill and dimming the sun a wind from lilliput as it struck the dinghy the fog took the distant ship it was a most extraordinary sight for in less than thirty seconds the ship of wood became a ship of gauze a tracery flickered and was gone forever from the sight of man chapter v voices heard in the mist the sun became fainter still and vanished though the air round the dinghy seemed quite clear the on coming boats were hazy and dim and that part of the horizon that had been fairly clear was now blotted out the long boat was leading by a good way when she was within hailing distance the captain’s voice came dinghy ahoy ahoy fetch alongside here the long boat ceased rowing to wait for the quarter boat that was slowly creeping up she was a heavy boat to pull at all times and now she was overloaded the wrath of captain le farge with paddy button for the way he had stampeded the crew was profound but he had not time to give vent to it here get aboard us mr lestrange said he when the dinghy was alongside we have room for one mrs stannard is in the quarter boat and it’s overcrowded she’s better aboard the dinghy for she can look after the kids come hurry up the smother is coming down on us fast ahoy to the quarter boat hurry up hurry up the quarter boat had suddenly vanished mr lestrange climbed into the long boat paddy pushed the dinghy a few yards away with the tip of a scull and then lay on his oars waiting ahoy ahoy cried le farge ahoy came from the fog bank next moment the long boat and the dinghy vanished from each other’s sight the great fog bank had taken them now a couple of strokes of the port scull would have brought mr button alongside the long boat so close was he but the quarter boat was in his mind or rather imagination so what must he do but take three powerful strokes in the direction in which he fancied the quarter boat to be the rest was voices dinghy ahoy ahoy ahoy don’t be shoutin together or i’ll not know which way to pull quarter boat ahoy where are yiz port your helm ay ay putting his helm so to speak to starboard i’ll be wid yiz in wan minute two or three minutes hard pulling ahoy much more faint what d’ye mane rowin away from me a dozen strokes ahoy fainter still mr button rested on his oars divil mend them i b’lave that was the long boat shoutin he took to his oars again and pulled vigorously paddy came dick’s small voice apparently from nowhere where are we now sure we’re in a fog where else would we be don’t you be affeared i ain’t affeared but em’s shivering give her me coat said the oarsman resting on his oars and taking it off wrap it round her and when it’s round her we’ll all let one big halloo together there’s an ould shawl som’er in the boat but i can’t be after lookin for it now he held out the coat and an almost invisible hand took it at the same moment a tremendous report shook the sea and sky there she goes said mr button an me old fiddle an all don’t be frightened childer it’s only a gun they’re firin for divarsion now we’ll all halloo togither are yiz ready ay ay said dick who was a picker up of sea terms halloo yelled pat halloo halloo piped dick and emmeline a faint reply came but from where it was difficult to say the old man rowed a few strokes and then paused on his oars so still was the surface of the sea that the chuckling of the water at the boat’s bow as she drove forward under the impetus of the last powerful stroke could be heard distinctly it died out as she lost way and silence closed round them like a ring the light from above a light that seemed to come through a vast scuttle of deeply muffed glass faint though it was almost to extinction still varied as the little boat floated through the strata of the mist a great sea fog is not homogeneous its density varies it is honeycombed with streets it has its caves of clear air its cliffs of solid vapour all shifting and changing place with the subtlety of legerdemain it has also this wizard peculiarity that it grows with the sinking of the sun and the approach of darkness the sun could they have seen it was now leaving the horizon they called again then they waited but there was no response there’s no use bawlin like bulls to chaps that’s deaf as adders said the old sailor shipping his oars immediately upon which declaration he gave another shout with the same result as far as eliciting a reply mr button came emmeline’s voice what is it honey i’m m fraid you wait wan minit till i find the shawl here it is by the same token an i’ll wrap you up in it he crept cautiously aft to the stern sheets and took emmeline in his arms don’t want the shawl said emmeline i’m not so much afraid in your coat the rough tobacco smelling old coat gave her courage somehow well thin keep it on dicky are you cowld i’ve got into daddy’s great coat he left it behind him well thin i’ll put the shawl round me own shoulders for it’s cowld i am are y hungry childer no said dick but i’m drefful hi yow slapy is it well down you get in the bottom of the boat and here’s the shawl for a pilla i’ll be rowin again in a minit to keep meself warm he buttoned the top button of the coat i’m a’right murmured emmeline in a dreamy voice shut your eyes tight replied mr button or billy winker will be dridgin sand in them shoheen shoheen shoheen shoheen sho hu lo sho hu lo shoheen shoheen shoheen shoheen hush a by the babby o it was the tag of an old nursery folk song they sing in the hovels of the achill coast fixed in his memory along with the rain and the wind and the smell of the burning turf and the grunting of the pig and the knickety knock of a rocking cradle she’s off murmured mr button to himself as the form in his arms relaxed then he laid her gently down beside dick he shifted forward moving like a crab then he put his hand to his pocket for his pipe and tobacco and tinder box they were in his coat pocket but emmeline was in his coat to search for them would be to awaken her the darkness of night was now adding itself to the blindness of the fog the oarsman could not see even the thole pins he sat adrift mind and body he was to use his own expression moithered haunted by the mist tormented by shapes it was just in a fog like this that the merrows could be heard disporting in dunbeg bay and off the achill coast sporting and laughing and hallooing through the mist to lead unfortunate fishermen astray merrows are not altogether evil but they have green hair and teeth fishes tails and fins for arms and to hear them walloping in the water around you like salmon and you alone in a small boat with the dread of one coming floundering on board is enough to turn a man’s hair grey for a moment he thought of awakening the children to keep him company but he was ashamed then he took to the sculls again and rowed by the feel of the water the creak of the oars was like a companion’s voice the exercise lulled his fears now and again forgetful of the sleeping children he gave a halloo and paused to listen but no answer came then he continued rowing long steady laborious strokes each taking him further and further from the boats that he was never destined to sight again chapter vi dawn on a wide wide sea is it aslape i’ve been said mr button suddenly awaking with a start he had shipped his oars just for a minute’s rest he must have slept for hours for now behold a warm gentle wind was blowing the moon was shining and the fog was gone is it dhraming i’ve been continued the awakened one where am i at all at all o musha sure here i am o wirra wirra i dreamt i’d gone aslape on the main hatch and the ship was blown up with powther and it’s all come true mr button came a small voice from the stern sheets emmeline’s what is it honey where are we now sure we’re afloat on the say acushla where else would we be where’s uncle he’s beyant there in the long boat he’ll be afther us in a minit i want a drink he filled a tin pannikin that was by the beaker of water and gave her a drink then he took his pipe and tobacco from his coat pocket she almost immediately fell asleep again beside dick who had not stirred or moved and the old sailor standing up and steadying himself cast his eyes round the horizon not a sign of sail or boat was there on all the moonlit sea from the low elevation of an open boat one has a very small horizon and in the vague world of moonlight somewhere round about it was possible that the boats might be near enough to show up at daybreak but open boats a few miles apart may be separated by long leagues in the course of a few hours nothing is more mysterious than the currents of the sea the ocean is an ocean of rivers some swiftly flowing some slow and a league from where you are drifting at the rate of a mile an hour another boat may be drifting two a slight warm breeze was frosting the water blending moonshine and star shimmer the ocean lay like a lake yet the nearest mainland was perhaps a thousand miles away the thoughts of youth may be long long thoughts but not longer than the thoughts of this old sailor man smoking his pipe under the stars thoughts as long as the world is round blazing bar rooms in callao harbours over whose oily surfaces the sampans slipped like water beetles the lights of macao the docks of london scarcely ever a sea picture pure and simple for why should an old seaman care to think about the sea where life is all into the fo’cs’le and out again where one voyage blends and jumbles with another where after forty five years of reefing topsails you can’t well remember off which ship it was jack rafferty fell overboard or who it was killed who in the fo’cs’le of what though you can still see as in a mirror darkly the fight and the bloody face over which a man is holding a kerosene lamp i doubt if paddy button could have told you the name of the first ship he ever sailed in if you had asked him he would probably have replied i disremimber it was to the baltic and cruel cowld weather and i was say sick till i near brought me boots up and it was o for ould ireland i was cryin all the time an the captin dhrummin me back with a rope’s end to the tune uv it but the name of the hooker i disremimber bad luck to her whoever she was so he sat smoking his pipe whilst the candles of heaven burned above him and calling to mind roaring drunken scenes and palm shadowed harbours and the men and the women he had known such men and such women the derelicts of the earth and the ocean then he nodded off to sleep again and when he awoke the moon had gone now in the eastern sky might have been seen a pale fan of light vague as the wing of an ephemera it vanished and changed back to darkness presently and almost at a stroke a pencil of fire ruled a line along the eastern horizon and the eastern sky became more beautiful than a rose leaf plucked in may the line of fire contracted into one increasing spot the rim of the rising sun as the light increased the sky above became of a blue impossible to imagine unless seen a wan blue yet living and sparkling as if born of the impalpable dust of sapphires then the whole sea flashed like the harp of apollo touched by the fingers of the god the light was music to the soul it was day daddy suddenly cried dick sitting up in the sunlight and rubbing his eyes with his open palms where are we all right dicky me son cried the old sailor who had been standing up casting his eyes round in a vain endeavour to sight the boats your daddy’s as safe as if he was in hivin he’ll be wid us in a minit an bring another ship along with him so you’re awake are you em’line emmeline sitting up in the old pilot coat nodded in reply without speaking another child might have supplemented dick’s enquiries as to her uncle by questions of her own but she did not did she guess that there was some subterfuge in mr button’s answer and that things were different from what he was making them out to be who can tell she was wearing an old cap of dick’s which mrs stannard in the hurry and confusion had popped on her head it was pushed to one side and she made a quaint enough little figure as she sat up in the early morning brightness dressed in the old salt stained coat beside dick whose straw hat was somewhere in the bottom of the boat and whose auburn locks were blowing in the faint breeze hurroo cried dick looking around at the blue and sparkling water and banging with a stretcher on the bottom of the boat i’m goin to be a sailor aren’t i paddy you’ll let me sail the boat won’t you paddy an show me how to row aisy does it said paddy taking hold of the child i haven’t a sponge or towel but i’ll just wash your face in salt wather and lave you to dry in the sun he filled the bailing tin with sea water i don’t want to wash shouted dick stick your face into the water in the tin commanded paddy you wouldn’t be going about the place with your face like a sut bag would you stick yours in commanded the other mr button did so and made a hub bubbling noise in the water then he lifted a wet and streaming face and flung the contents of the bailing tin overboard now you’ve lost your chance said this arch nursery strategist all the water’s gone there’s more in the sea there’s no more to wash with not till to morrow the fishes don’t allow it i want to wash grumbled dick i want to stick my face in the tin same’s you did sides em hasn’t washed _i_ don’t mind murmured emmeline well thin said mr button as if making a sudden resolve i’ll ax the sharks he leaned over the boat’s side his face close to the surface of the water halloo there he shouted and then bent his head sideways to listen the children also looked over the side deeply interested halloo there are y’aslape oh there y’are here’s a spalpeen with a dhirty face an’s wishful to wash it may i take a bailin tin of oh thank your arner thank your arner good day to you and my respects what did the shark say mr button asked emmeline he said take a bar’l full an welcome mister button an it’s wishful i am i had a drop of the crathur to offer you this fine marnin thin he popped his head under his fin and went aslape agin leastwise i heard him snore emmeline nearly always mr buttoned her friend sometimes she called him mr paddy as for dick it was always paddy pure and simple children have etiquettes of their own it must often strike landsmen and landswomen that the most terrible experience when cast away at sea in an open boat is the total absence of privacy it seems an outrage on decency on the part of providence to herd people together so but whoever has gone through the experience will bear me out that in great moments of life like this the human mind enlarges and things that would shock us ashore are as nothing out there face to face with eternity if so with grown up people how much more so with this old shell back and his two charges and indeed mr button was a person who called a spade a spade had no more conventions than a walrus and looked after his two charges just as a nursemaid might look after her charges or a walrus after its young there was a large bag of biscuits in the boat and some tinned stuff mostly sardines i have known a sailor to open a box of sardines with a tin tack he was in prison the sardines had been smuggled into him and he had no can opener only his genius and a tin tack paddy had a jack knife however and in a marvellously short time a box of sardines was opened and placed on the stern sheets beside some biscuits these with some water and emmeline’s tangerine orange which she produced and added to the common store formed the feast and they fell to when they had finished the remains were put carefully away and they proceeded to step the tiny mast the sailor when the mast was in its place stood for a moment resting his hand on it and gazing around him over the vast and voiceless blue the pacific has three blues the blue of morning the blue of midday and the blue of evening but the blue of morning is the happiest the happiest thing in colour sparkling vague newborn the blue of heaven and youth what are you looking for paddy asked dick say gulls replied the prevaricator then to himself not a sight or a sound of them musha musha which way will i steer north south aist or west it’s all wan for if i steer to the aist they may be in the west and if i steer to the west they may be in the aist and i can’t steer to the west for i’d be steering right in the wind’s eye aist it is i’ll make a soldier’s wind of it and thrust to chance he set the sail and came aft with the sheet then he shifted the rudder lit a pipe leaned luxuriously back and gave the bellying sail to the gentle breeze it was part of his profession part of his nature that steering maybe straight towards death by starvation and thirst he was as unconcerned as if he were taking the children for a summer’s sail his imagination dealt little with the future almost entirely influenced by his immediate surroundings it could conjure up no fears from the scene now before it the children were the same never was there a happier starting more joy in a little boat during breakfast the seaman had given his charges to understand that if dick did not meet his father and emmeline her uncle in a while or two it was because he had gone on board a ship and he’d be along presently the terror of their position was as deeply veiled from them as eternity is veiled from you or me the pacific was still bound by one of those glacial calms that can only occur when the sea has been free from storms for a vast extent of its surface for a hurricane down by the horn will send its swell and disturbance beyond the marquesas de bois in his table of amplitudes points out that more than half the sea disturbances at any given space are caused not by the wind but by storms at a great distance but the sleep of the pacific is only apparent this placid lake over which the dinghy was pursuing the running ripple was heaving to an imperceptible swell and breaking on the shores of the low archipelago and the marquesas in foam and thunder emmeline’s rag doll was a shocking affair from a hygienic or artistic standpoint its face was just inked on it had no features no arms yet not for all the dolls in the world would she have exchanged this filthy and nearly formless thing it was a fetish she sat nursing it on one side of the helmsman whilst dick on the other side hung his nose over the water on the look out for fish why do you smoke mr button asked emmeline who had been watching her friend for some time in silence to aise me thrubbles replied paddy he was leaning back with one eye shut and the other fixed on the luff of the sail he was in his element nothing to do but steer and smoke warmed by the sun and cooled by the breeze a landsman would have been half demented in his condition many a sailor would have been taciturn and surly on the look out for sails and alternately damning his soul and praying to his god paddy smoked whoop cried dick look paddy an albicore a few cables lengths to port had taken a flying leap from the flashing sea turned a complete somersault and vanished it’s an albicore takin a buck lep hundreds i’ve seen before this he’s bein chased what’s chasing him paddy what’s chasin him why what else but the gibly gobly ums before dick could enquire as to the personal appearance and habits of the latter a shoal of silver arrow heads passed the boat and flittered into the water with"
