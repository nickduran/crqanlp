old sea king 39 the sluggish blood in the old man's veins with sudden vigor stirred i hear them call cried the dying man his eyes grew full of light now bring me here my warrior robes my sword and armor bright in the tempest's lull i heard a voice i knew twas odin's call the valkyrs are gathering round my bed to lead me unto his hall bear me unto my noblest ship light up a funeral pyre i'll walk to the palace of the braves through a path of flame and fire oh wild and bright was the stormy light that flashed from the old man's eye as they bore him from the couch of death to his battle ship to die and lit with many a mournful torch the sea king's dying bed and like a banner fair and bright the flames around him spread 40 save the boys but they heard no cry of anguish break through that fiery wall with rigid brow and silent lips he was seeking odin's hall through a path of fearful splendor while strong men held their breath the brave old man went boldly forth and calmly talked with death save the boys like dives in the deeps of hell i cannot break this fearful spell nor quench the fires i've madly nursed nor cool this dreadful raging thirst take back your pledge ye come too late ye cannot save me from my fate nor bring me back departed joys but ye can try to save the boys ye bid me break my fiery chain arise and be a man again save the boys 41 when every street with snares is spread and nets of sin where'er i tread no i must reap as i did sow the seeds of sin bring crops of woe but with my latest breath i'll crave that ye will try the boys to save these bloodshot eyes were once so bright this sin crushed heart was glad and light but by the wine cup's ruddy glow i traced a path to shame and woe a captive to my galling chain i've tried to rise but tried in vain the cup allures and then destroys oh from its thraldom save the boys take from your streets those traps of hell into whose gilded snares i fell oh freemen from these foul decoys arise and vote to save the boys oh ye who license men to trade in draughts that charm and then degrade before ye hear the cry too late oh save the boys from my sad fate 42 nothing and something nothing and something it is nothing to me the beauty said with a careless toss of her pretty head the man is weak if he can't refrain from the cup you say is fraught with pain it was something to her in after years when her eyes were drenched with burning tears and she watched in lonely grief and dread and startled to hear a staggering tread it is nothing to me the mother said i have no fear that my boy will tread in the downward path of sin and shame and crush my heart and darken his name it was something to her when that only son from the path of right was early won and madly cast in the flowing bowl a ruined body and sin wrecked soul it is nothing to me the young man cried in his eye was a flash of scorn and pride i heed not the dreadful things ye tell i can rule myself i know full well nothing and something 43 it was something to him when in prison he lay the victim of drink life ebbing away and thought of his wretched child and wife and the mournful wreck of his wasted life it is nothing to me the merchant said as over his ledger he bent his head i'm busy to day with tare and tret and i have no time to fume and fret it was something to him when over the wire a message came from a funeral pyre a drunken conductor had wrecked a train and his wife and child were among the slain it is nothing to me the voter said the party's loss is my greatest dread then gave his vote for the liquor trade though hearts were crushed and drunkards made it was something to him in after life when his daughter became a drunkard's wife and her hungry children cried for bread and trembled to hear their father's tread is it nothing for us to idly sleep while the cohorts of death their vigils keep to gather the young and thoughtless in and grind in our midst a grist of sin 44 vashti it is something yes all for us to stand clasping by faith our saviour's hand to learn to labor live and fight on the side of god and changeless light vashti she leaned her head upon her hand and heard the king's decree my lords are feasting in my halls bid vashti come to me i've shown the treasures of my house my costly jewels rare but with the glory of her eyes no rubies can compare adorn'd and crown'd i'd have her come with all her queenly grace and mid my lords and mighty men unveil her lovely face each gem that sparkles in my crown or glitters on my throne vashti 45 grows poor and pale when she appears my beautiful my own all waiting stood the chamberlains to hear the queen's reply they saw her cheek grow deathly pale but light flash'd to her eye go tell the king she proudly said that i am persia's queen and by his crowds of merry men i never will be seen i'll take the crown from off my head and tread it neath my feet before their rude and careless gaze my shrinking eyes shall meet a queen unveil'd before the crowd upon each lip my name why persia's women all would blush and weep for vashti's shame go back she cried and waved her hand and grief was in her eye go tell the king she sadly said that i would rather die 46 vashti they brought her message to the king dark flash'd his angry eye twas as the lightning ere the storm hath swept in fury by then bitterly outspoke the king through purple lips of wrath what shall be done to her who dares to cross your monarch's path then spake his wily counsellors o king of this fair land from distant ind to ethiop all bow to thy command but if before thy servants eyes this thing they plainly see that vashti doth not heed thy will nor yield herself to thee the women restive neath our rule would learn to scorn our name and from her deed to us would come reproach and burning shame then gracious king sign with thy hand this stern but just decree thank god for little children 47 that vashti lay aside her crown thy queen no more to be she heard again the king's command and left her high estate strong in her earnest womanhood she calmly met her fate and left the palace of the king proud of her spotless name a woman who could bend to grief but would not bow to shame thank god for little children thank god for little children bright flowers by earth's wayside the dancing joyous lifeboats upon life's stormy tide thank god for little children when our skies are cold and gray they come as sunshine to our hearts and charm our cares away 48 thank god for little children i almost think the angels who tend life's garden fair drop down the sweet wild blossoms that bloom around us here it seems a breath of heaven round many a cradle lies and every little baby brings a message from the skies dear mothers guard these jewels as sacred offerings meet a wealth of household treasures to lay at jesus feet the martyr of alabama tim thompson a little negro boy was asked to dance for the amusement of some white toughs he refused saying he was a church member one of the men knocked him down with a club and then danced upon his prostrate form he then shot the boy in the hip the boy is dead his murderer is still at large news item he lifted up his pleading eyes and scanned each cruel face where cold and brutal cowardice had left its evil trace it was when tender memories round beth'lem's manger lay 49 50 the martyr of alabama and mothers told their little ones of jesu's natal day and of the magi from the east who came their gifts to bring and bow in rev'rence at the feet of salem's new born king and how the herald angels sang the choral song of peace that war should close his wrathful lips and strife and carnage cease at such an hour men well may hush their discord and their strife and o'er that manger clasp their hands with gifts to brighten life alas that in our favored land that cruelty and crime should cast their shadows o'er a day the fairest pearl of time a dark browed boy had drawn anear a band of savage men just as a hapless lamb might stray into a tiger's den the martyr of alabama 51 cruel and dull they saw in him for sport an evil chance and then demanded of the child to give to them a dance come dance for us the rough men said i can't the child replied i cannot for the dear lord's sake who for my sins once died tho they were strong and he was weak he wouldn't his lord deny his life lay in their cruel hands but he for christ could die heard they aright did that brave child their mandates dare resist did he against their stern commands have courage to insist then recklessly a man arose and dealt a fearful blow he crushed the portals of that life and laid the brave child low and trampled on his prostrate form as on a broken toy 52 the martyr of alabama then danced with careless brutal feet upon the murdered boy christians behold that martyred child his blood cries from the ground before the sleepless eye of god he shows each gaping wound oh church of christ arise arise lest crimson stain thy hand when god shall inquisition make for blood shed in the land take sackcloth of the darkest hue and shroud the pulpits round servants of him who cannot lie sit mourning on the ground let holy horror blanch each brow pale every cheek with fears and rocks and stones if ye could speak ye well might melt to tears through every fane send forth a cry of sorrow and regret nor in an hour of careless ease thy brother's wrongs forget the night of death 53 veil not thine eyes nor close thy lips nor speak with bated breath this evil shall not always last the end of it is death avert the doom that crime must bring upon a guilty land strong in the strength that god supplies for truth and justice stand for christless men with reckless hands are sowing round thy path the tempests wild that yet shall break in whirlwinds of god's wrath the night of death twas a night of dreadful horror death was sweeping through the land and the wings of dark destruction were outstretched from strand to strand strong men's hearts grew faint with terror as the tempest and the waves 54 the night of death wrecked their homes and swept them downward suddenly to yawning graves mid the wastes of ruined households and the tempest's wild alarms stood a terror stricken mother with a child within her arms other children huddled round her each one nestling in her heart swift in thought and swift in action she at least from one must part then she said unto her daughter strive to save one child from death which one said the anxious daughter as she stood with bated breath oh the anguish of that mother what despair was in her eye all her little ones were precious which one should she leave to die then outspake the brother bennie i will take the little one no exclaimed the anxious mother no my child it can't be done the night of death 55 see my boy the waves are rising save yourself and leave the child i will trust in christ he answered grasped the little one and smiled through the roar of wind and waters ever and anon she cried but throughout the night of terror never bennie's voice replied but above the waves wild surging he had found a safe retreat as if god had sent an angel just to guide his wandering feet when the storm had spent its fury and the sea gave up its dead she was mourning for her loved ones lost amid that night of dread while her head was bowed in anguish on her ear there fell a voice bringing surcease to her sorrow bidding all her heart rejoice didn't i tell you true said bennie and his eyes were full of light 56 mother's treasures when i told you god would help me through the dark and dreadful night and he placed the little darling safe within his mother's arms feeling christ had been his guardian mid the dangers and alarms oh for faith so firm and precious in the darkest saddest night till life's gloom encircled shadows fade in everlasting light and upon the mount of vision we our loved and lost shall greet with earth's wildest storms behind us and its cares beneath our feet mother's treasures two little children sit by my side i call them lily and daffodil i gaze on them with a mother's pride one is edna the other is will both have eyes of starry light and laughing lips o'er teeth of pearl mother's treasures 57 i would not change for a diadem my noble boy and darling girl to night my heart o'erflows with joy i hold them as a sacred trust i fain would hide them in my heart safe from tarnish of moth and rust what should i ask for my dear boy the richest gifts of wealth or fame what for my girl a loving heart and a fair and a spotless name what for my boy that he should stand a pillar of strength to the state what for my girl that she should be the friend of the poor and desolate i do not ask they shall never tread with weary feet the paths of pain i ask that in the darkest hour they may faithful and true remain i only ask their lives may be pure as gems in the gates of pearl lives to brighten and bless the world this i ask for my boy and girl 58 the refiner's gold i ask to clasp their hands again mid the holy hosts of heaven enraptured say i am here oh god and the children thou hast given the refiner's gold he stood before my heart's closed door and asked to enter in but i had barred the passage o'er by unbelief and sin he came with nail prints in his hands to set my spirit free with wounded feet he trod a path to come and sup with me he found me poor and brought me gold the fire of love had tried and garments whitened by his blood my wretchedness to hide the glare of life had dimmed my eyes its glamour was too bright he came with ointment in his hands to heal my darkened sight the refiner's gold 59 he knew my heart was tempest tossed by care and pain oppressed he whispered to my burdened heart come unto me and rest he found me weary faint and worn on barren mountains cold with love's constraint he drew me on to shelter in his fold oh foolish heart how slow wert thou to welcome thy dear guest to change thy weariness and care for comfort peace and rest close to his side oh may i stay just to behold his face till i shall wear within my soul the image of his grace the grace that changes hearts of stone to tenderness and love and bids us run with willing feet unto his courts above 60 a story of the rebellion a story of the rebellion the treacherous sands had caught our boat and held it with a strong embrace and death at our imprisoned crew was sternly looking face to face with anxious hearts but failing strength we strove to push the boat from shore but all in vain for there we lay with bated breath and useless oar around us in a fearful storm the fiery hail fell thick and fast and we engirded by the sand could not return the dreadful blast when one arose upon whose brow the ardent sun had left his trace a noble purpose strong and high uplighting all his dusky face perchance within that fateful hour the wrongs of ages thronged apace but with it came the glorious hope of swift deliverance to his race of galling chains asunder rent of severed hearts again made one a story of the rebellion 61 of freedom crowning all the land through battles gained and victories won some one our hero firmly said must die to get us out of this then leaped upon the strand and bared his bosom to the bullets hiss but ye are soldiers and can fight may win in battles yet unfought i have no offering but my life and if they kill me it is nought with steady hands he grasped the boat and boldly pushed it from the shore then fell by rebel bullets pierced his life work grandly nobly o'er our boat was rescued from the sands and launched in safety on the tide but he our comrade good and grand in our defence had bravely died burial of sarah he stood before the sons of heth and bowed his sorrowing head 62 burial of sarah i've come he said to buy a place where i may lay my dead i am a stranger in your land my home has lost its light grant me a place where i may lay my dead away from sight then tenderly the sons of heth gazed on the mourner's face and said oh prince amid our dead choose thou her resting place the sepulchres of those we love we place at thy command against the plea thy grief hath made we close not heart nor hand the patriarch rose and bowed his head and said one place i crave tis at the end of ephron's field and called machpelah's cave entreat him that he sell to me for her last sleep that cave i do not ask for her i loved the freedom of a grave burial of sarah 63 the son of zohar answered him hearken my lord to me before our sons the field and cave i freely give to thee i will not take it as a gift the grand old man then said i pray thee let me buy the place where i may lay my dead and with the promise in his heart his seed should own that land he gave the shekels for the field he took from ephron's hand and saw afar the glorious day his chosen seed should tread the soil where he in sorrow lay his loved and cherished dead going east she came from the east a fair young bride with a light and a bounding heart to find in the distant west a home with her husband to make a start 64 going east he builded his cabin far away where the prairie flower bloomed wild her love made lighter all his toil and joy and hope around him smiled she plied her hands to life's homely tasks and helped to build his fortunes up while joy and grief like bitter and sweet were mingled and mixed in her cup he sowed in his fields of golden grain all the strength of his manly prime nor music of birds nor brooks nor bees was as sweet as the dollar's chime she toiled and waited through weary years for the fortune that came at length but toil and care and hope deferred had stolen and wasted her strength the cabin changed to a stately home rich carpets were hushing her tread but light was fading from her eye and the bloom from her cheek had fled slower and heavier grew her step while his gold and his gains increased going east 65 but his proud domain had not the charm of her humble home in the east within her eye was a restless light and a yearning that never ceased a longing to see the dear old home she had left in the distant east a longing to clasp her mother's hand and nestle close to her heart and to feel the heavy cares of life like the sun kissed shadows depart her husband was adding field to field and new wealth to his golden store and little thought the shadow of death was entering in at his door he had no line to sound the depths of her tears repressed and unshed nor dreamed mid plenty a human heart could be starving but not for bread the hungry heart was stilled at last its restless baffled yearning ceased a lonely man sat by the bier of a corpse that was going east 66 the hermit's sacrifice the hermit's sacrifice from rome's palaces and villas gaily issued forth a throng from her humbler habitations moved a human tide along haughty dames and blooming maidens men who knew not mercy's sway thronged into the coliseum on that roman holiday from the lonely wilds of asia from her jungles far away from the distant torrid regions rome had gathered beasts of prey lions restless roaring rampant tigers with their stealthy tread leopards bright and fierce and fiery met in conflict wild and dread fierce and fearful was the carnage of the maddened beasts of prey as they fought and rent each other urged by men more fierce than they till like muffled thunders breaking on a vast and distant shore the hermit's sacrifice 67 fainter grew the yells of tigers and the lions dreadful roar on the crimson stained arena lay the victims of the fight eyes which once had glared with anguish lost in death their baleful light then uprose the gladiators armed for conflict unto death waiting for the prefect's signal cold and stern with bated breath ave caesar morituri te salutant rose the cry from the lips of men ill fated doomed to suffer and to die then began the dreadful contest lives like chaff were thrown away rome with all her pride and power butchered for a holiday eagerly the crowd were waiting loud the clashing sabres rang when between the gladiators all unarmed a hermit sprang 68 the hermit's sacrifice cease your bloodshed cried the hermit on this carnage place your ban but with flashing swords they answered back unto your place old man from their path the gladiators thrust the strange intruder back who between their hosts advancing calmly parried their attack all undaunted by their weapons stood the old heroic man while a maddened cry of anger through the vast assembly ran down with him cried out the people as with thumbs unbent they glared till the prefect gave the signal that his life should not be spared men grew wild with wrathful passion when his fearless words were said cruelly they fiercely showered stones on his devoted head bruised and bleeding fell the hermit victor in that hour of strife songs for the people 69 gaining in his death a triumph that he could not win in life had he uttered on the forum struggling thoughts within him born men had jeered his words as madness but his deed they could not scorn not in vain had been his courage nor for naught his daring deed from his grave his mangled body did for wretched captives plead from that hour rome grown more thoughtful ceased her sport in human gore and into her coliseum gladiators came no more songs for the people let me make the songs for the people songs for the old and young songs to stir like a battle cry wherever they are sung not for the clashing of sabres for carnage nor for strife 70 songs for the people but songs to thrill the hearts of men with more abundant life let me make the songs for the weary amid life's fever and fret till hearts shall relax their tension and careworn brows forget let me sing for little children before their footsteps stray sweet anthems of love and duty to float o'er life's highway i would sing for the poor and aged when shadows dim their sight of the bright and restful mansions where there shall be no night our world so worn and weary needs music pure and strong to hush the jangle and discords of sorrow pain and wrong music to soothe all its sorrow till war and crime shall cease and the hearts of men grown tender girdle the world with peace let the light enter 71 let the light enter the dying words of goethe light more light the shadows deepen and my life is ebbing low throw the windows widely open light more light before i go softly let the balmy sunshine play around my dying bed e'er the dimly lighted valley i with lonely feet must tread light more light for death is weaving shadows round my waning sight and i fain would gaze upon him through a stream of earthly light not for greater gifts of genius not for thoughts more grandly bright all the dying poet whispers is a prayer for light more light heeds he not the gathered laurels fading slowly from his sight all the poet's aspirations centre in that prayer for light 72 an appeal to my countrywomen gracious saviour when life's day dreams melt and vanish from the sight may our dim and longing vision then be blessed with light more light an appeal to my countrywomen you can sigh o'er the sad eyed armenian who weeps in her desolate home you can mourn o'er the exile of russia from kindred and friends doomed to roam you can pity the men who have woven from passion and appetite chains to coil with a terrible tension around their heartstrings and brains you can sorrow o'er little children disinherited from their birth the wee waifs and toddlers neglected robbed of sunshine music and mirth for beasts you have gentle compassion your mercy and pity they share for the wretched outcast and fallen you have tenderness love and care an appeal to my countrywomen 73 but hark from our southland are floating sobs of anguish murmurs of pain and women heart stricken are weeping over their tortured and their slain on their brows the sun has left traces shrink not from their sorrow in scorn when they entered the threshold of being the children of a king were born each comes as a guest to the table the hand of our god has outspread to fountains that ever leap upward to share in the soil we all tread when ye plead for the wrecked and fallen the exile from far distant shores remember that men are still wasting life's crimson around your own doors have ye not oh my favored sisters just a plea a prayer or a tear for mothers who dwell neath the shadows of agony hatred and fear men may tread down the poor and lowly may crush them in anger and hate 74 an appeal to my countrywomen but surely the mills of god's justice will grind out the grist of their fate oh people sin laden and guilty so lusty and proud in your prime the sharp sickles of god's retribution will gather your harvest of crime weep not oh my well sheltered sisters weep not for the negro alone but weep for your sons who must gather the crops which their fathers have sown go read on the tombstones of nations of chieftains who masterful trod the sentence which time has engraven that they had forgotten their god tis the judgment of god that men reap the tares which in madness they sow sorrow follows the footsteps of crime and sin is the consort of woe then and now 75 then and now build me a nation said the lord the distant nations heard the word build me a nation true and strong bar out the old world's hate and wrong for men had traced with blood and tears the trail of weary wasting years and torn and bleeding martyrs trod through fire and torture up to god while in the hollow of his hand god hid the secret of our land men warred against their fiercest foes and kingdoms fell and empires rose till weary of the old world strife men sought for broader freer life and
