proceeded to lock and double lock and secure with tape and sealing wax all the avenues of the delinquent vessel instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution after the mischief had happened a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal the moment that there was no longer any remedy unless people are more than commonly disagreeable it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them the better part of my companion's character if it have a better part is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard and forms the type whereby i recognise the man as most of these old custom house officers had good traits and as my position in reference to them being paternal and protective was favourable to the growth of friendly sentiments i soon grew to like them all it was pleasant in the summer forenoons when the fervent heat that almost liquefied the rest of the human family merely communicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systems it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry a row of them all tipped against the wall as usual while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out and came bubbling with laughter from their lips externally the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children the intellect any more than a deep sense of humour has little to do with the matter it is with both a gleam that plays upon the surface and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and grey mouldering trunk in one case however it is real sunshine in the other it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood it would be sad injustice the reader must understand to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage in the first place my coadjutors were not invariably old there were men among them in their strength and prime of marked ability and energy and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them then moreover the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair but as respects the majority of my corps of veterans there will be no wrong done if i characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life they seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical wisdom which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting and most carefully to have stored their memory with the husks they spoke with far more interest and unction of their morning's breakfast or yesterday's to day's or tomorrow's dinner than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago and all the world's wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes the father of the custom house the patriarch not only of this little squad of officials but i am bold to say of the respectable body of tide waiters all over the united states was a certain permanent inspector he might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system dyed in the wool or rather born in the purple since his sire a revolutionary colonel and formerly collector of the port had created an office for him and appointed him to fill it at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember this inspector when i first knew him was a man of fourscore years or thereabouts and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter green that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime's search with his florid cheek his compact figure smartly arrayed in a bright buttoned blue coat his brisk and vigorous step and his hale and hearty aspect altogether he seemed not young indeed but a kind of new contrivance of mother nature in the shape of man whom age and infirmity had no business to touch his voice and laugh which perpetually re echoed through the custom house had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old man's utterance they came strutting out of his lungs like the crow of a cock or the blast of a clarion looking at him merely as an animal and there was very little else to look at he was a most satisfactory object from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system and his capacity at that extreme age to enjoy all or nearly all the delights which he had ever aimed at or conceived of the careless security of his life in the custom house on a regular income and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him the original and more potent causes however lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature the moderate proportion of intellect and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients these latter qualities indeed being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on all fours he possessed no power of thought no depth of feeling no troublesome sensibilities nothing in short but a few commonplace instincts which aided by the cheerful temper which grew inevitably out of his physical well being did duty very respectably and to general acceptance in lieu of a heart he had been the husband of three wives all long since dead the father of twenty children most of whom at every age of childhood or maturity had likewise returned to dust here one would suppose might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition through and through with a sable tinge not so with our old inspector one brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences the next moment he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant far readier than the collector's junior clerk who at nineteen years was much the elder and graver man of the two i used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with i think livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice he was in truth a rare phenomenon so perfect in one point of view so shallow so delusive so impalpable such an absolute nonentity in every other my conclusion was that he had no soul no heart no mind nothing as i have already said but instincts and yet withal so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together that there was no painful perception of deficiency but on my part an entire contentment with what i found in him it might be difficult and it was so to conceive how he should exist hereafter so earthly and sensuous did he seem but surely his existence here admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath had been not unkindly given with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age one point in which he had vastly the advantage over his four footed brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat his gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait and to hear him talk of roast meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster as he possessed no higher attribute and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish poultry and butcher's meat and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table his reminiscences of good cheer however ancient the date of the actual banquet seemed to bring the savour of pig or turkey under one's very nostrils there were flavours on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast i have heard him smack his lips over dinners every guest at which except himself had long been food for worms it was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him not in anger or retribution but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to reduplicate an endless series of enjoyment at once shadowy and sensual a tenderloin of beef a hind quarter of veal a spare rib of pork a particular chicken or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder adams would be remembered while all the subsequent experience of our race and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze the chief tragic event of the old man's life so far as i could judge was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago a goose of most promising figure but which at table proved so inveterately tough that the carving knife would make no impression on its carcase and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw but it is time to quit this sketch on which however i should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because of all men whom i have ever known this individual was fittest to be a custom house officer most persons owing to causes which i may not have space to hint at suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life the old inspector was incapable of it and were he to continue in office to the end of time would be just as good as he was then and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite there is one likeness without which my gallery of custom house portraits would be strangely incomplete but which my comparatively few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest outline it is that of the collector our gallant old general who after his brilliant military service subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild western territory had come hither twenty years before to spend the decline of his varied and honourable life the brave soldier had already numbered nearly or quite his three score years and ten and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spirit stirring recollections could do little towards lightening the step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge it was only with the assistance of a servant and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade that he could slowly and painfully ascend the custom house steps and with a toilsome progress across the floor attain his customary chair beside the fireplace there he used to sit gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went amid the rustle of papers the administering of oaths the discussion of business and the casual talk of the office all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation his countenance in this repose was mild and kindly if his notice was sought an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features proving that there was light within him and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage the closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind the sounder it appeared when no longer called upon to speak or listen either of which operations cost him an evident effort his face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude it was not painful to behold this look for though dim it had not the imbecility of decaying age the framework of his nature originally strong and massive was not yet crumpled into ruin to observe and define his character however under such disadvantages was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew in imagination an old fortress like ticonderoga from a view of its grey and broken ruins here and there perchance the walls may remain almost complete but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound cumbrous with its very strength and overgrown through long years of peace and neglect with grass and alien weeds nevertheless looking at the old warrior with affection for slight as was the communication between us my feeling towards him like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him might not improperly be termed so i could discern the main points of his portrait it was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not a mere accident but of good right that he had won a distinguished name his spirit could never i conceive have been characterized by an uneasy activity it must at any period of his life have required an impulse to set him in motion but once stirred up with obstacles to overcome and an adequate object to be attained it was not in the man to give out or fail the heat that had formerly pervaded his nature and which was not yet extinct was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze but rather a deep red glow as of iron in a furnace weight solidity firmness this was the expression of his repose even in such decay as had crept untimely over him at the period of which i speak but i could imagine even then that under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness roused by a trumpet's peal loud enough to awaken all of his energies that were not dead but only slumbering he was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man's gown dropping the staff of age to seize a battle sword and starting up once more a warrior and in so intense a moment his demeanour would have still been calm such an exhibition however was but to be pictured in fancy not to be anticipated nor desired what i saw in him as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of old ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate simile was the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days of integrity that like most of his other endowments lay in a somewhat heavy mass and was just as unmalleable or unmanageable as a ton of iron ore and of benevolence which fiercely as he led the bayonets on at chippewa or fort erie i take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age he had slain men with his own hand for aught i know certainly they had fallen like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe before the charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energy but be that as it might there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterfly's wing i have not known the man to whose innate kindliness i would more confidently make an appeal many characteristics and those too which contribute not the least forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch must have vanished or been obscured before i met the general all merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent nor does nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay as she sows wall flowers over the ruined fortress of ticonderoga still even in respect of grace and beauty there were points well worth noting a ray of humour now and then would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces a trait of native elegance seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth was shown in the general's fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers an old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow but here was one who seemed to have a young girl's appreciation of the floral tribe there beside the fireplace the brave old general used to sit while the surveyor though seldom when it could be avoided taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation was fond of standing at a distance and watching his quiet and almost slumberous countenance he seemed away from us although we saw him but a few yards off remote though we passed close beside his chair unattainable though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own it might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts than amid the unappropriate environment of the collector's office the evolutions of the parade the tumult of the battle the flourish of old heroic music heard thirty years before such scenes and sounds perhaps were all alive before his intellectual sense meanwhile the merchants and ship masters the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors entered and departed the bustle of his commercial and custom house life kept up its little murmur round about him and neither with the men nor their affairs did the general appear to sustain the most distant relation he was as much out of place as an old sword now rusty but which had flashed once in the battle's front and showed still a bright gleam along its blade would have been among the inkstands paper folders and mahogany rulers on the deputy collector's desk there was one thing that much aided me in renewing and re creating the stalwart soldier of the niagara frontier the man of true and simple energy it was the recollection of those memorable words of his i'll try sir spoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise and breathing the soul and spirit of new england hardihood comprehending all perils and encountering all if in our country valour were rewarded by heraldic honour this phrase which it seems so easy to speak but which only he with such a task of danger and glory before him has ever spoken would be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the general's shield of arms it contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself who care little for his pursuits and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate the accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office there was one man especially the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent his gifts were emphatically those of a man of business prompt acute clear minded with an eye that saw through all perplexities and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish as by the waving of an enchanter's wand bred up from boyhood in the custom house it was his proper field of activity and the many intricacies of business so harassing to the interloper presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system in my contemplation he stood as the ideal of his class he was indeed the custom house in himself or at all events the mainspring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion for in an institution like this where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them thus by an inevitable necessity as a magnet attracts steel filings so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with with an easy condescension and kind forbearance towards our stupidity which to his order of mind must have seemed little short of crime would he forth with by the merest touch of his finger make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight the merchants valued him not less than we his esoteric friends his integrity was perfect it was a law of nature with him rather than a choice or a principle nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs a stain on his conscience as to anything that came within the range of his vocation would trouble such a man very much in the same way though to a far greater degree than an error in the balance of an account or an ink blot on the fair page of a book of record here in a word and it is a rare instance in my life i had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held such were some of the people with whom i now found myself connected i took it in good part at the hands of providence that i was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had after my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren of brook farm after living for three years within the subtle influence of an intellect like emerson's after those wild free days on the assabeth indulging fantastic speculations beside our fire of fallen boughs with ellery channing after talking with thoreau about pine trees and indian relics in his hermitage at walden after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of hillard's culture after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at longfellow's hearthstone it was time at length that i should exercise other faculties of my nature and nourish myself with food for which i had hitherto had little appetite even the old inspector was desirable as a change of diet to a man who had known alcott i looked upon it as an evidence in some measure of a system naturally well balanced and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization that with such associates to remember i could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities and never murmur at the change literature its exertions and objects were now of little moment in my regard i cared not at this period for books they were apart from me nature except it were human nature the nature that is developed in earth and sky was in one sense hidden from me and all the imaginative delight wherewith it had been spiritualized passed away out of my mind a gift a faculty if it had not been departed was suspended and inanimate within me there would have been something sad unutterably dreary in all this had i not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past it might be true indeed that this was a life which could not with impunity be lived too long else it might make me permanently other than i had been without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take but i never considered it as other than a transitory life there was always a prophetic instinct a low whisper in my ear that within no long period and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good change would come meanwhile there i was a surveyor of the revenue and so far as i have been able to understand as good a surveyor as need be a man of thought fancy and sensibility had he ten times the surveyor's proportion of those qualities may at any time be a man of affairs if he will only choose to give himself the trouble my fellow officers and the merchants and sea captains with whom my official duties brought me into any manner of connection viewed me in no other light and probably knew me in no other character none of them i presume had ever read a page of my inditing or would have cared a fig the more for me if they had read them all nor would it have mended the matter in the least had those same unprofitable pages been written with a pen like that of burns or of chaucer each of whom was a custom house officer in his day as well as i it is a good lesson though it may often be a hard one for a man who has dreamed of literary fame and of making for himself a rank among the world's dignitaries by such means to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized and to find how utterly devoid of significance beyond that circle is all that he achieves and all he aims at i know not that i especially needed the lesson either in the way of warning or rebuke but at any rate i learned it thoroughly nor it gives me pleasure to reflect did the truth as it came home to my perception ever cost me a pang or require to be thrown off in a sigh in the way of literary talk it is true the naval officer an excellent fellow who came into the office with me and went out only a little later would often engage me in a discussion about one or the other of his favourite topics napoleon or shakespeare the collector's junior clerk too a young gentleman who it was whispered occasionally covered a sheet of uncle sam's letter paper with what at the distance of a few yards looked very much like poetry used now and then to speak to me of books as matters with which i might possibly be conversant this was my all of lettered intercourse and it was quite sufficient for my necessities no longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blasoned abroad on title pages i smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue the custom house marker imprinted it with a stencil and black paint on pepper bags and baskets of anatto and cigar boxes and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost and gone regularly through the office borne on such queer vehicle of fame a knowledge of my existence so far as a name conveys it was carried where it had never been before and i hope will never go again but the past was not dead once in a great while the thoughts that had seemed so vital and so active yet had been put to rest so quietly revived again one of the most remarkable occasions when the habit of bygone days awoke in me was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which i am now writing in the second storey of the custom house there is a large room in which the brick work and naked rafters have never been covered with panelling and plaster the edifice originally projected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be realized contains far more space than its occupants know what to do with this airy hall therefore over the collector's apartments remains unfinished to this day and in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams appears still to await the labour of the carpenter and mason at one end of the room in a recess were a number of barrels piled one upon another containing bundles of official documents large quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor it was sorrowful to think how many days and weeks and months and years of toil had been wasted on these musty papers which were now only an encumbrance on earth and were hidden away in this forgotten corner never more to be glanced at by human eyes but then what reams of other manuscripts filled not with the dulness of official formalities but with the thought of inventive brains and the rich effusion of deep hearts had gone equally to oblivion and that moreover without serving a purpose in their day as these heaped up papers had and saddest of all without purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the clerks of the custom house had gained by these worthless scratchings of the pen yet not altogether worthless perhaps as materials of local history here no doubt statistics of the former commerce of salem might be discovered and memorials of her princely merchants old king derby old billy gray old simon forrester and many another magnate in his day whose powdered head however was scarcely in the tomb before his mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle the founders of the greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of salem might here be traced from the petty and obscure beginnings of their traffic at periods generally much posterior to the revolution upward to what their children look upon"
