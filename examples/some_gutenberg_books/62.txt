floor of the cave and then down at myself in utter bewilderment for there i lay clothed and yet here i stood but naked as at the minute of my birth the transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me for a moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis my first thought was is this then death have i indeed passed over forever into that other life but i could not well believe this as i could feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me my breath was coming in quick short gasps cold sweat stood out from every pore of my body and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed the fact that i was anything other than a wraith again was i suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave naked and unarmed as i was i had no desire to face the unseen thing which menaced me my revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which for some unfathomable reason i could not bring myself to touch my carbine was in its boot strapped to my saddle and as my horse had wandered off i was left without means of defense my only alternative seemed to lie in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the rustling sound from the thing which now seemed in the darkness of the cave and to my distorted imagination to be creeping stealthily upon me unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place i leaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear arizona night the crisp fresh mountain air outside the cave acted as an immediate tonic and i felt new life and new courage coursing through me pausing upon the brink of the ledge i upbraided myself for what now seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension i reasoned with myself that i had lain helpless for many hours within the cave yet nothing had molested me and my better judgment when permitted the direction of clear and logical reasoning convinced me that the noises i had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes probably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze had caused the sounds i heard i decided to investigate but first i lifted my head to fill my lungs with the pure invigorating night air of the mountains as i did so i saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge and level cacti studded flat wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of soft splendor and wondrous enchantment few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an arizona moonlit landscape the silvered mountains in the distance the strange lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo and the grotesque details of the stiff yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and inspiring as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse of some dead and forgotten world so different is it from the aspect of any other spot upon our earth as i stood thus meditating i turned my gaze from the landscape to the heavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy for the wonders of the earthly scene my attention was quickly riveted by a large red star close to the distant horizon as i gazed upon it i felt a spell of overpowering fascination it was mars the god of war and for me the fighting man it had always held the power of irresistible enchantment as i gazed at it on that far gone night it seemed to call across the unthinkable void to lure me to it to draw me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron my longing was beyond the power of opposition i closed my eyes stretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself drawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of space there was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness chapter iii my advent on mars i opened my eyes upon a strange and weird landscape i knew that i was on mars not once did i question either my sanity or my wakefulness i was not asleep no need for pinching here my inner consciousness told me as plainly that i was upon mars as your conscious mind tells you that you are upon earth you do not question the fact neither did i i found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish mosslike vegetation which stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles i seemed to be lying in a deep circular basin along the outer verge of which i could distinguish the irregularities of low hills it was midday the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it was rather intense upon my naked body yet no greater than would have been true under similar conditions on an arizona desert here and there were slight outcroppings of quartz bearing rock which glistened in the sunlight and a little to my left perhaps a hundred yards appeared a low walled enclosure about four feet in height no water and no other vegetation than the moss was in evidence and as i was somewhat thirsty i determined to do a little exploring springing to my feet i received my first martian surprise for the effort which on earth would have brought me standing upright carried me into the martian air to the height of about three yards i alighted softly upon the ground however without appreciable shock or jar now commenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous in the extreme i found that i must learn to walk all over again as the muscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon earth played strange antics with me upon mars instead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner my attempts to walk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground a couple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face or back at the end of each second or third hop my muscles perfectly attuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on earth played the mischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with the lesser gravitation and lower air pressure on mars i was determined however to explore the low structure which was the only evidence of habitation in sight and so i hit upon the unique plan of reverting to first principles in locomotion creeping i did fairly well at this and in a few moments had reached the low encircling wall of the enclosure there appeared to be no doors or windows upon the side nearest me but as the wall was but about four feet high i cautiously gained my feet and peered over the top upon the strangest sight it had ever been given me to see the roof of the enclosure was of solid glass about four or five inches in thickness and beneath this were several hundred large eggs perfectly round and snowy white the eggs were nearly uniform in size being about two and one half feet in diameter five or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which sat blinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity they seemed mostly head with little scrawny bodies long necks and six legs or as i afterward learned two legs and two arms with an intermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as arms or legs their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads a trifle above the center and protruded in such a manner that they could be directed either forward or back and also independently of each other thus permitting this queer animal to look in any direction or in two directions at once without the necessity of turning the head the ears which were slightly above the eyes and closer together were small cup shaped antennae protruding not more than an inch on these young specimens their noses were but longitudinal slits in the center of their faces midway between their mouths and ears there was no hair on their bodies which were of a very light yellowish green color in the adults as i was to learn quite soon this color deepens to an olive green and is darker in the male than in the female further the heads of the adults are not so out of proportion to their bodies as in the case of the young the iris of the eyes is blood red as in albinos while the pupil is dark the eyeball itself is very white as are the teeth these latter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and terrible countenance as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points which end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located the whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory but of the snowiest and most gleaming of china against the dark background of their olive skins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner making these weapons present a singularly formidable appearance most of these details i noted later for i was given but little time to speculate on the wonders of my new discovery i had seen that the eggs were in the process of hatching and as i stood watching the hideous little monsters break from their shells i failed to note the approach of a score of full grown martians from behind me coming as they did over the soft and soundless moss which covers practically the entire surface of mars with the exception of the frozen areas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts they might have captured me easily but their intentions were far more sinister it was the rattling of the accouterments of the foremost warrior which warned me on such a little thing my life hung that i often marvel that i escaped so easily had not the rifle of the leader of the party swung from its fastenings beside his saddle in such a way as to strike against the butt of his great metal shod spear i should have snuffed out without ever knowing that death was near me but the little sound caused me to turn and there upon me not ten feet from my breast was the point of that huge spear a spear forty feet long tipped with gleaming metal and held low at the side of a mounted replica of the little devils i had been watching but how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and terrific incarnation of hate of vengeance and of death the man himself for such i may call him was fully fifteen feet in height and on earth would have weighed some four hundred pounds he sat his mount as we sit a horse grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs while the hands of his two right arms held his immense spear low at the side of his mount his two left arms were outstretched laterally to help preserve his balance the thing he rode having neither bridle or reins of any description for guidance and his mount how can earthly words describe it it towered ten feet at the shoulder had four legs on either side a broad flat tail larger at the tip than at the root and which it held straight out behind while running a gaping mouth which split its head from its snout to its long massive neck like its master it was entirely devoid of hair but was of a dark slate color and exceeding smooth and glossy its belly was white and its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid yellow at the feet the feet themselves were heavily padded and nailless which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of their approach and in common with a multiplicity of legs is a characteristic feature of the fauna of mars the highest type of man and one other animal the only mammal existing on mars alone have well formed nails and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in existence there behind this first charging demon trailed nineteen others similar in all respects but as i learned later bearing individual characteristics peculiar to themselves precisely as no two of us are identical although we are all cast in a similar mold this picture or rather materialized nightmare which i have described at length made but one terrible and swift impression on me as i turned to meet it unarmed and naked as i was the first law of nature manifested itself in the only possible solution of my immediate problem and that was to get out of the vicinity of the point of the charging spear consequently i gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leap to reach the top of the martian incubator for such i had determined it must be my effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than it seemed to surprise the martian warriors for it carried me fully thirty feet into the air and landed me a hundred feet from my pursuers and on the opposite side of the enclosure i alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap and turning saw my enemies lined up along the further wall some were surveying me with expressions which i afterward discovered marked extreme astonishment and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that i had not molested their young they were conversing together in low tones and gesticulating and pointing toward me their discovery that i had not harmed the little martians and that i was unarmed must have caused them to look upon me with less ferocity but as i was to learn later the thing which weighed most in my favor was my exhibition of hurdling while the martians are immense their bones are very large and they are muscled only in proportion to the gravitation which they must overcome the result is that they are infinitely less agile and less powerful in proportion to their weight than an earth man and i doubt that were one of them suddenly to be transported to earth he could lift his own weight from the ground in fact i am convinced that he could not do so my feat then was as marvelous upon mars as it would have been upon earth and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon me as a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among their fellows the respite my unexpected agility had given me permitted me to formulate plans for the immediate future and to note more closely the appearance of the warriors for i could not disassociate these people in my mind from those other warriors who only the day before had been pursuing me i noted that each was armed with several other weapons in addition to the huge spear which i have described the weapon which caused me to decide against an attempt at escape by flight was what was evidently a rifle of some description and which i felt for some reason they were peculiarly efficient in handling these rifles were of a white metal stocked with wood which i learned later was a very light and intensely hard growth much prized on mars and entirely unknown to us denizens of earth the metal of the barrel is an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they have learned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel with which we are familiar the weight of these rifles is comparatively little and with the small caliber explosive radium projectiles which they use and the great length of the barrel they are deadly in the extreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on earth the theoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles but the best they can do in actual service when equipped with their wireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles this is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the martian firearm and some telepathic force must have warned me against an attempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty of these death dealing machines the martians after conversing for a short time turned and rode away in the direction from which they had come leaving one of their number alone by the enclosure when they had covered perhaps two hundred yards they halted and turning their mounts toward us sat watching the warrior by the enclosure he was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me and was evidently the leader of the band as i had noted that they seemed to have moved to their present position at his direction when his force had come to a halt he dismounted threw down his spear and small arms and came around the end of the incubator toward me entirely unarmed and as naked as i except for the ornaments strapped upon his head limbs and breast when he was within about fifty feet of me he unclasped an enormous metal armlet and holding it toward me in the open palm of his hand addressed me in a clear resonant voice but in a language it is needless to say i could not understand he then stopped as though waiting for my reply pricking up his antennae like ears and cocking his strange looking eyes still further toward me as the silence became painful i concluded to hazard a little conversation on my own part as i had guessed that he was making overtures of peace the throwing down of his weapons and the withdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me would have signified a peaceful mission anywhere on earth so why not then on mars placing my hand over my heart i bowed low to the martian and explained to him that while i did not understand his language his actions spoke for the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dear to my heart of course i might have been a babbling brook for all the intelligence my speech carried to him but he understood the action with which i immediately followed my words stretching my hand toward him i advanced and took the armlet from his open palm clasping it about my arm above the elbow smiled at him and stood waiting his wide mouth spread into an answering smile and locking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned and walked back toward his mount at the same time he motioned his followers to advance they started toward us on a wild run but were checked by a signal from him evidently he feared that were i to be really frightened again i might jump entirely out of the landscape he exchanged a few words with his men motioned to me that i would ride behind one of them and then mounted his own animal the fellow designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him on the glossy back of his mount where i hung on as best i could by the belts and straps which held the martian's weapons and ornaments the entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range of hills in the distance chapter iv a prisoner we had gone perhaps ten miles when the ground began to rise very rapidly we were as i was later to learn nearing the edge of one of mars long dead seas in the bottom of which my encounter with the martians had taken place in a short time we gained the foot of the mountains and after traversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley at the far extremity of which was a low table land upon which i beheld an enormous city toward this we galloped entering it by what appeared to be a ruined roadway leading out from the city but only to the edge of the table land where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps upon closer observation i saw as we passed them that the buildings were deserted and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not having been tenanted for years possibly for ages toward the center of the city was a large plaza and upon this and in the buildings immediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundred creatures of the same breed as my captors for such i now considered them despite the suave manner in which i had been trapped with the exception of their ornaments all were naked the women varied in appearance but little from the men except that their tusks were much larger in proportion to their height in some instances curving nearly to their high set ears their bodies were smaller and lighter in color and their fingers and toes bore the rudiments of nails which were entirely lacking among the males the adult females ranged in height from ten to twelve feet the children were light in color even lighter than the women and all looked precisely alike to me except that some were taller than others older i presumed i saw no signs of extreme age among them nor is there any appreciable difference in their appearance from the age of maturity about forty until at about the age of one thousand years they go voluntarily upon their last strange pilgrimage down the river iss which leads no living martian knows whither and from whose bosom no martian has ever returned or would be allowed to live did he return after once embarking upon its cold dark waters only about one martian in a thousand dies of sickness or disease and possibly about twenty take the voluntary pilgrimage the other nine hundred and seventy nine die violent deaths in duels in hunting in aviation and in war but perhaps by far the greatest death loss comes during the age of childhood when vast numbers of the little martians fall victims to the great white apes of mars the average life expectancy of a martian after the age of maturity is about three hundred years but would be nearer the one thousand mark were it not for the various means leading to violent death owing to the waning resources of the planet it evidently became necessary to counteract the increasing longevity which their remarkable skill in therapeutics and surgery produced and so human life has come to be considered but lightly on mars as is evidenced by their dangerous sports and the almost continual warfare between the various communities there are other and natural causes tending toward a diminution of population but nothing contributes so greatly to this end as the fact that no male or female martian is ever voluntarily without a weapon of destruction as we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we were immediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxious to pluck me from my seat behind my guard a word from the leader of the party stilled their clamor and we proceeded at a trot across the plaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye has rested upon the building was low but covered an enormous area it was constructed of gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones which sparkled and scintillated in the sunlight the main entrance was some hundred feet in width and projected from the building proper to form a huge canopy above the entrance hall there was no stairway but a gentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into an enormous chamber encircled by galleries on the floor of this chamber which was dotted with highly carved wooden desks and chairs were assembled about forty or fifty male martians around the steps of a rostrum on the platform proper squatted an enormous warrior heavily loaded with metal ornaments gay colored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappings ingeniously set with precious stones from his shoulders depended a short cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk what struck me as most remarkable about this assemblage and the hall in which they were congregated was the fact that the creatures were entirely out of proportion to the desks chairs and other furnishings these being of a size adapted to human beings such as i whereas the great bulks of the martians could scarcely have squeezed into the chairs nor was there room beneath the desks for their long legs evidently then there were other denizens on mars than the wild and grotesque creatures into whose hands i had fallen but the evidences of extreme antiquity which showed all around me indicated that these buildings might have belonged to some long extinct and forgotten race in the dim antiquity of mars our party had halted at the entrance to the building and at a sign from the leader i had been lowered to the ground again locking his arm in mine we had proceeded into the audience chamber there were few formalities observed in approaching the martian chieftain my captor merely strode up to the rostrum the others making way for him as he advanced the chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name of my escort who in turn halted and repeated the name of the ruler followed by his title at the time this ceremony and the words they uttered meant nothing to me but later i came to know that this was the customary greeting between green martians had the men been strangers and therefore unable to exchange names they would have silently exchanged ornaments had their missions been peaceful otherwise they would have exchanged shots or have fought out their introduction with some other of their various weapons my captor whose name was tars tarkas was virtually the vice chieftain of the community and a man of great ability as a statesman and warrior he evidently explained briefly the incidents connected with his expedition including my capture and when he had concluded the chieftain addressed me at some length i replied in our good old english tongue merely to convince him that neither of us could understand the other but i noticed that when i smiled slightly on concluding he did likewise this fact and the similar occurrence during my first talk with tars tarkas convinced me that we had at least something in common the ability to smile therefore to laugh denoting a sense of humor but i was to learn that the martian smile is merely perfunctory and that the martian laugh is a thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror the ideas of humor among the green men of mars are widely at variance with our conceptions of incitants to merriment the death agonies of a fellow being are to these strange creatures provocative of the wildest hilarity while their chief form of commonest amusement is to inflict death on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways the assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely feeling my muscles and the texture of my skin the principal chieftain then evidently signified a desire to see me perform and motioning me to follow he started with tars tarkas for the open plaza now i had made no attempt to walk since my first signal failure except while tightly grasping tars tarkas arm and so now i went skipping and flitting about among the desks and chairs like some monstrous grasshopper after bruising myself severely much to the amusement of the martians i again had recourse to creeping but this did not suit them and i was roughly jerked to my feet by a towering fellow who had laughed most heartily at my misfortunes as he banged me down upon my feet his face was bent close to mine and i did the only thing a gentleman might do under the circumstances of brutality boorishness and lack of consideration for a stranger's rights i swung my fist squarely to his jaw and he went down like a felled ox as he sunk to the floor i wheeled around with my back toward the nearest desk expecting to be overwhelmed by the vengeance of his fellows but determined to give them as good a battle as the unequal odds would permit before i gave up my life my fears were groundless however as the other martians at first struck dumb with wonderment finally broke into wild peals of laughter and applause i did not recognize the applause as such but later when i had become acquainted with their customs i learned that i had won what they seldom accord a manifestation of approbation the fellow whom i had struck lay where he had fallen nor did any of his mates approach him tars tarkas advanced toward me holding out one of his arms and we thus proceeded to the plaza without further mishap i did not of course know the reason for which we had come to the open but i was not long in being enlightened they first repeated the word sak a number of"
