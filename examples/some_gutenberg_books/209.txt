"1" "grose listened with dumb emotion she forbore to ask me what this meaning might be so that presently to put the thing with some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind i went on that he's an injury to the others at this with one of the quick turns of simple folk she suddenly flamed up master miles him an injury there was such a flood of good faith in it that though i had not yet seen the child my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea i found myself to meet my friend the better offering it on the spot sarcastically to his poor little innocent mates it's too dreadful cried mrs grose to say such cruel things why he's scarce ten years old yes yes it would be incredible she was evidently grateful for such a profession see him miss first then believe it i felt forthwith a new impatience to see him it was the beginning of a curiosity that for all the next hours was to deepen almost to pain mrs grose was aware i could judge of what she had produced in me and she followed it up with assurance you might as well believe it of the little lady bless her she added the next moment look at her i turned and saw that flora whom ten minutes before i had established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper a pencil and a copy of nice round o's now presented herself to view at the open door she expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties looking to me however with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person which had rendered necessary that she should follow me i needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of mrs grose's comparison and catching my pupil in my arms covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement nonetheless the rest of the day i watched for further occasion to approach my colleague especially as toward evening i began to fancy she rather sought to avoid me i overtook her i remember on the staircase we went down together and at the bottom i detained her holding her there with a hand on her arm i take what you said to me at noon as a declaration that you've never known him to be bad she threw back her head she had clearly by this time and very honestly adopted an attitude oh never known him i don't pretend that i was upset again then you have known him yes indeed miss thank god on reflection i accepted this you mean that a boy who never is is no boy for me i held her tighter you like them with the spirit to be naughty then keeping pace with her answer so do i i eagerly brought out but not to the degree to contaminate to contaminate my big word left her at a loss i explained it to corrupt she stared taking my meaning in but it produced in her an odd laugh are you afraid he'll corrupt you she put the question with such a fine bold humor that with a laugh a little silly doubtless to match her own i gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule but the next day as the hour for my drive approached i cropped up in another place what was the lady who was here before the last governess she was also young and pretty almost as young and almost as pretty miss even as you ah then i hope her youth and her beauty helped her i recollect throwing off he seems to like us young and pretty oh he did mrs grose assented it was the way he liked everyone she had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up i mean that's his way the master's i was struck but of whom did you speak first she looked blank but she colored why of him of the master of who else there was so obviously no one else that the next moment i had lost my impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant and i merely asked what i wanted to know did she see anything in the boy that wasn't right she never told me i had a scruple but i overcame it was she careful particular mrs grose appeared to try to be conscientious about some things yes but not about all again she considered well miss she's gone i won't tell tales i quite understand your feeling i hastened to reply but i thought it after an instant not opposed to this concession to pursue did she die here no she went off i don't know what there was in this brevity of mrs grose's that struck me as ambiguous went off to die mrs grose looked straight out of the window but i felt that hypothetically i had a right to know what young persons engaged for bly were expected to do she was taken ill you mean and went home she was not taken ill so far as appeared in this house she left it at the end of the year to go home as she said for a short holiday to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right we had then a young woman a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good girl and clever and she took the children altogether for the interval but our young lady never came back and at the very moment i was expecting her i heard from the master that she was dead i turned this over but of what he never told me but please miss said mrs grose i must get to my work iii her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not for my just preoccupations a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem we met after i had brought home little miles more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction my general emotion so monstrous was i then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict i was a little late on the scene and i felt as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down that i had seen him on the instant without and within in the great glow of freshness the same positive fragrance of purity in which i had from the first moment seen his little sister he was incredibly beautiful and mrs grose had put her finger on it everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence what i then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that i have never found to the same degree in any child his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love it would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence and by the time i had got back to bly with him i remained merely bewildered so far that is as i was not outraged by the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my room in a drawer as soon as i could compass a private word with mrs grose i declared to her that it was grotesque she promptly understood me you mean the cruel charge it doesn't live an instant my dear woman look at him she smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm i assure you miss i do nothing else what will you say then she immediately added in answer to the letter i had made up my mind nothing and to his uncle i was incisive nothing and to the boy himself i was wonderful nothing she gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth then i'll stand by you we'll see it out we'll see it out i ardently echoed giving her my hand to make it a vow she held me there a moment then whisked up her apron again with her detached hand would you mind miss if i used the freedom to kiss me no i took the good creature in my arms and after we had embraced like sisters felt still more fortified and indignant this at all events was for the time a time so full that as i recall the way it went it reminds me of all the art i now need to make it a little distinct what i look back at with amazement is the situation i accepted i had undertaken with my companion to see it out and i was under a charm apparently that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort i was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity i found it simple in my ignorance my confusion and perhaps my conceit to assume that i could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning i am unable even to remember at this day what proposal i framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies lessons with me indeed that charming summer we all had a theory that he was to have but i now feel that for weeks the lessons must have been rather my own i learned something at first certainly that had not been one of the teachings of my small smothered life learned to be amused and even amusing and not to think for the morrow it was the first time in a manner that i had known space and air and freedom all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature and then there was consideration and consideration was sweet oh it was a trap not designed but deep to my imagination to my delicacy perhaps to my vanity to whatever in me was most excitable the best way to picture it all is to say that i was off my guard they gave me so little trouble they were of a gentleness so extraordinary i used to speculate but even this with a dim disconnectedness as to how the rough future for all futures are rough would handle them and might bruise them they had the bloom of health and happiness and yet as if i had been in charge of a pair of little grandees of princes of the blood for whom everything to be right would have to be enclosed and protected the only form that in my fancy the afteryears could take for them was that of a romantic a really royal extension of the garden and the park it may be of course above all that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of stillness that hush in which something gathers or crouches the change was actually like the spring of a beast in the first weeks the days were long they often at their finest gave me what i used to call my own hour the hour when for my pupils teatime and bedtime having come and gone i had before my final retirement a small interval alone much as i liked my companions this hour was the thing in the day i liked most and i liked it best of all when as the light faded or rather i should say the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded in a flushed sky from the old trees i could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me the beauty and dignity of the place it was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified doubtless perhaps also to reflect that by my discretion my quiet good sense and general high propriety i was giving pleasure if he ever thought of it to the person to whose pressure i had responded what i was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me and that i could after all do it proved even a greater joy than i had expected i daresay i fancied myself in short a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear well i needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign it was plump one afternoon in the middle of my very hour the children were tucked away and i had come out for my stroll one of the thoughts that as i don't in the least shrink now from noting used to be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet someone someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve i didn't ask more than that i only asked that he should know and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it and the kind light of it in his handsome face that was exactly present to me by which i mean the face was when on the first of these occasions at the end of a long june day i stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house what arrested me on the spot and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for was the sense that my imagination had in a flash turned real he did stand there but high up beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which on that first morning little flora had conducted me this tower was one of a pair square incongruous crenelated structures that were distinguished for some reason though i could see little difference as the new and the old they flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious dating in their gingerbread antiquity from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past i admired them had fancies about them for we could all profit in a degree especially when they loomed through the dusk by the grandeur of their actual battlements yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure i had so often invoked seemed most in place it produced in me this figure in the clear twilight i remember two distinct gasps of emotion which were sharply the shock of my first and that of my second surprise my second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first the man who met my eyes was not the person i had precipitately supposed there came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which after these years there is no living view that i can hope to give an unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred and the figure that faced me was a few more seconds assured me as little anyone else i knew as it was the image that had been in my mind i had not seen it in harley street i had not seen it anywhere the place moreover in the strangest way in the world had on the instant and by the very fact of its appearance become a solitude to me at least making my statement here with a deliberation with which i have never made it the whole feeling of the moment returns it was as if while i took in what i did take in all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death i can hear again as i write the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped the rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky and the friendly hour lost for the minute all its voice but there was no other change in nature unless indeed it were a change that i saw with a stranger sharpness the gold was still in the sky the clearness in the air and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a picture in a frame that's how i thought with extraordinary quickness of each person that he might have been and that he was not we were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel as an effect of my inability to say a wonder that in a few instants more became intense the great question or one of these is afterward i know with regard to certain matters the question of how long they have lasted well this matter of mine think what you will of it lasted while i caught at a dozen possibilities none of which made a difference for the better that i could see in there having been in the house and for how long above all a person of whom i was in ignorance it lasted while i just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person it lasted while this visitant at all events and there was a touch of the strange freedom as i remember in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat seemed to fix me from his position with just the question just the scrutiny through the fading light that his own presence provoked we were too far apart to call to each other but there was a moment at which at shorter range some challenge between us breaking the hush would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare he was in one of the angles the one away from the house very erect as it struck me and with both hands on the ledge so i saw him as i see the letters i form on this page then exactly after a minute as if to add to the spectacle he slowly changed his place passed looking at me hard all the while to the opposite corner of the platform yes i had the sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me and i can see at this moment the way his hand as he went passed from one of the crenelations to the next he stopped at the other corner but less long and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me he turned away that was all i knew iv it was not that i didn't wait on this occasion for more for i was rooted as deeply as i was shaken was there a secret at bly a mystery of udolpho or an insane an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement i can't say how long i turned it over or how long in a confusion of curiosity and dread i remained where i had had my collision i only recall that when i re entered the house darkness had quite closed in agitation in the interval certainly had held me and driven me for i must in circling about the place have walked three miles but i was to be later on so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill the most singular part of it in fact singular as the rest had been was the part i became in the hall aware of in meeting mrs grose this picture comes back to me in the general train the impression as i received it on my return of the wide white panelled space bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet and of the good surprised look of my friend which immediately told me she had missed me it came to me straightway under her contact that with plain heartiness mere relieved anxiety at my appearance she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident i had there ready for her i had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up and i somehow measured the importance of what i had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one as i may say with the instinct of sparing my companion on the spot accordingly in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me i for a reason that i couldn't then have phrased achieved an inward resolution offered a vague pretext for my lateness and with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet went as soon as possible to my room here it was another affair here for many days after it was a queer affair enough there were hours from day to day or at least there were moments snatched even from clear duties when i had to shut myself up to think it was not so much yet that i was more nervous than i could bear to be as that i was remarkably afraid of becoming so for the truth i had now to turn over was simply and clearly the truth that i could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom i had been so inexplicably and yet as it seemed to me so intimately concerned it took little time to see that i could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complications the shock i had suffered must have sharpened all my senses i felt sure at the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention that i had not been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any game of whatever it was that i knew nothing was known around me there was but one sane inference someone had taken a liberty rather gross that was what repeatedly i dipped into my room and locked the door to say to myself we had been collectively subject to an intrusion some unscrupulous traveler curious in old houses had made his way in unobserved enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view and then stolen out as he came if he had given me such a bold hard stare that was but a part of his indiscretion the good thing after all was that we should surely see no more of him this was not so good a thing i admit as not to leave me to judge that what essentially made nothing else much signify was simply my charming work my charming work was just my life with miles and flora and through nothing could i so like it as through feeling that i could throw myself into it in trouble the attraction of my small charges was a constant joy leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears the distaste i had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office there was to be no gray prose it appeared and no long grind so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty it was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom i don't mean by this of course that we studied only fiction and verse i mean i can express no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired how can i describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to them and it's a marvel for a governess i call the sisterhood to witness i made constant fresh discoveries there was one direction assuredly in which these discoveries stopped deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the boy's conduct at school it had been promptly given me i have noted to face that mystery without a pang perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that without a word he himself had cleared it up he had made the whole charge absurd my conclusion bloomed there with the real rose flush of his innocence he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid unclean school world and he had paid a price for it i reflected acutely that the sense of such differences such superiorities of quality always on the part of the majority which could include even stupid sordid headmasters turn infallibly to the vindictive both the children had a gentleness it was their only fault and it never made miles a muff that kept them how shall i express it almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable they were like the cherubs of the anecdote who had morally at any rate nothing to whack i remember feeling with miles in especial as if he had had as it were no history we expect of a small child a scant one but there was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive yet extraordinarily happy that more than in any creature of his age i have seen struck me as beginning anew each day he had never for a second suffered i took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised if he had been wicked he would have caught it and i should have caught it by the rebound i should have found the trace i found nothing at all and he was therefore an angel he never spoke of his school never mentioned a comrade or a master and i for my part was quite too much disgusted to allude to them of course i was under the spell and the wonderful part is that even at the time i perfectly knew i was but i gave myself up to it it was an antidote to any pain and i had more pains than one i was in receipt in these days of disturbing letters from home where things were not going well but with my children what things in the world mattered that was the question i used to put to my scrappy retirements i was dazzled by their loveliness there was a sunday to get on when it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church in consequence of which as the day declined i had arranged with mrs grose that should the evening show improvement we would attend together the late service the rain happily stopped and i prepared for our walk which through the park and by the good road to the village would be a matter of twenty minutes coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall i remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received them with a publicity perhaps not edifying while i sat with the children at their tea served on sundays by exception in that cold clean temple of mahogany and brass the grown up dining room the gloves had been dropped there and i turned in to recover them the day was gray enough but the afternoon light still lingered and it enabled me on crossing the threshold not only to recognize on a chair near the wide window then closed the articles i wanted but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in one step into the room had sufficed my vision was instantaneous it was all there the person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to me he appeared thus again with i won't say greater distinctness for that was impossible but with a nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me as i met him catch my breath and turn cold he was the same he was the same and seen this time as he had been seen before from the waist up the window though the dining room was on the ground floor not going down to the terrace on which he stood his face was close to the glass yet the effect of this better view was strangely only to show me how intense the former had been he remained but a few seconds long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized but it was as if i had been looking at him for years and had known him always something however happened this time that had not happened before his stare into my face through the glass and across the room was as deep and hard as then but it quitted me for a moment during which i could still watch it see it fix successively several other things on the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there he had come for someone else the flash of this knowledge for it was knowledge in the midst of dread produced in me the most extraordinary effect started as i stood there a sudden vibration of duty and courage i say courage because i was beyond all doubt already far gone i bounded straight out of the door again reached that of the house got in an instant upon the drive and passing along the terrace as fast as i could rush"
