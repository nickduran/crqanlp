"1" "as black as ebony no not ebony will you call him blackbird like your uncle's old horse no he is far handsomer than old blackbird ever was yes she said he is really quite a beauty and he has such a sweet good tempered face and such a fine intelligent eye what do you say to calling him black beauty black beauty why yes i think that is a very good name if you like it shall be his name and so it was when john went into the stable he told james that master and mistress had chosen a good sensible english name for me that meant something not like marengo or pegasus or abdallah they both laughed and james said if it was not for bringing back the past i should have named him rob roy for i never saw two horses more alike that's no wonder said john didn't you know that farmer grey's old duchess was the mother of them both i had never heard that before and so poor rob roy who was killed at that hunt was my brother i did not wonder that my mother was so troubled it seems that horses have no relations at least they never know each other after they are sold john seemed very proud of me he used to make my mane and tail almost as smooth as a lady's hair and he would talk to me a great deal of course i did not understand all he said but i learned more and more to know what he meant and what he wanted me to do i grew very fond of him he was so gentle and kind he seemed to know just how a horse feels and when he cleaned me he knew the tender places and the ticklish places when he brushed my head he went as carefully over my eyes as if they were his own and never stirred up any ill temper james howard the stable boy was just as gentle and pleasant in his way so i thought myself well off there was another man who helped in the yard but he had very little to do with ginger and me a few days after this i had to go out with ginger in the carriage i wondered how we should get on together but except laying her ears back when i was led up to her she behaved very well she did her work honestly and did her full share and i never wish to have a better partner in double harness when we came to a hill instead of slackening her pace she would throw her weight right into the collar and pull away straight up we had both the same sort of courage at our work and john had oftener to hold us in than to urge us forward he never had to use the whip with either of us then our paces were much the same and i found it very easy to keep step with her when trotting which made it pleasant and master always liked it when we kept step well and so did john after we had been out two or three times together we grew quite friendly and sociable which made me feel very much at home as for merrylegs he and i soon became great friends he was such a cheerful plucky good tempered little fellow that he was a favorite with every one and especially with miss jessie and flora who used to ride him about in the orchard and have fine games with him and their little dog frisky our master had two other horses that stood in another stable one was justice a roan cob used for riding or for the luggage cart the other was an old brown hunter named sir oliver he was past work now but was a great favorite with the master who gave him the run of the park he sometimes did a little light carting on the estate or carried one of the young ladies when they rode out with their father for he was very gentle and could be trusted with a child as well as merrylegs the cob was a strong well made good tempered horse and we sometimes had a little chat in the paddock but of course i could not be so intimate with him as with ginger who stood in the same stable 06 liberty i was quite happy in my new place and if there was one thing that i missed it must not be thought i was discontented all who had to do with me were good and i had a light airy stable and the best of food what more could i want why liberty for three years and a half of my life i had had all the liberty i could wish for but now week after week month after month and no doubt year after year i must stand up in a stable night and day except when i am wanted and then i must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years straps here and straps there a bit in my mouth and blinkers over my eyes now i am not complaining for i know it must be so i only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits who has been used to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed then round and back again with a snort to his companions i say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like sometimes when i have had less exercise than usual i have felt so full of life and spring that when john has taken me out to exercise i really could not keep quiet do what i would it seemed as if i must jump or dance or prance and many a good shake i know i must have given him especially at the first but he was always good and patient steady steady my boy he would say wait a bit and we will have a good swing and soon get the tickle out of your feet then as soon as we were out of the village he would give me a few miles at a spanking trot and then bring me back as fresh as before only clear of the fidgets as he called them spirited horses when not enough exercised are often called skittish when it is only play and some grooms will punish them but our john did not he knew it was only high spirits still he had his own ways of making me understand by the tone of his voice or the touch of the rein if he was very serious and quite determined i always knew it by his voice and that had more power with me than anything else for i was very fond of him i ought to say that sometimes we had our liberty for a few hours this used to be on fine sundays in the summer time the carriage never went out on sundays because the church was not far off it was a great treat to us to be turned out into the home paddock or the old orchard the grass was so cool and soft to our feet the air so sweet and the freedom to do as we liked was so pleasant to gallop to lie down and roll over on our backs or to nibble the sweet grass then it was a very good time for talking as we stood together under the shade of the large chestnut tree 07 ginger one day when ginger and i were standing alone in the shade we had a great deal of talk she wanted to know all about my bringing up and breaking in and i told her well said she if i had had your bringing up i might have had as good a temper as you but now i don't believe i ever shall why not i said because it has been all so different with me she replied i never had any one horse or man that was kind to me or that i cared to please for in the first place i was taken from my mother as soon as i was weaned and put with a lot of other young colts none of them cared for me and i cared for none of them there was no kind master like yours to look after me and talk to me and bring me nice things to eat the man that had the care of us never gave me a kind word in my life i do not mean that he ill used me but he did not care for us one bit further than to see that we had plenty to eat and shelter in the winter a footpath ran through our field and very often the great boys passing through would fling stones to make us gallop i was never hit but one fine young colt was badly cut in the face and i should think it would be a scar for life we did not care for them but of course it made us more wild and we settled it in our minds that boys were our enemies we had very good fun in the free meadows galloping up and down and chasing each other round and round the field then standing still under the shade of the trees but when it came to breaking in that was a bad time for me several men came to catch me and when at last they closed me in at one corner of the field one caught me by the forelock another caught me by the nose and held it so tight i could hardly draw my breath then another took my under jaw in his hard hand and wrenched my mouth open and so by force they got on the halter and the bar into my mouth then one dragged me along by the halter another flogging behind and this was the first experience i had of men's kindness it was all force they did not give me a chance to know what they wanted i was high bred and had a great deal of spirit and was very wild no doubt and gave them i dare say plenty of trouble but then it was dreadful to be shut up in a stall day after day instead of having my liberty and i fretted and pined and wanted to get loose you know yourself it's bad enough when you have a kind master and plenty of coaxing but there was nothing of that sort for me there was one the old master mr ryder who i think could soon have brought me round and could have done anything with me but he had given up all the hard part of the trade to his son and to another experienced man and he only came at times to oversee his son was a strong tall bold man they called him samson and he used to boast that he had never found a horse that could throw him there was no gentleness in him as there was in his father but only hardness a hard voice a hard eye a hard hand and i felt from the first that what he wanted was to wear all the spirit out of me and just make me into a quiet humble obedient piece of horseflesh horseflesh yes that is all that he thought about and ginger stamped her foot as if the very thought of him made her angry then she went on if i did not do exactly what he wanted he would get put out and make me run round with that long rein in the training field till he had tired me out i think he drank a good deal and i am quite sure that the oftener he drank the worse it was for me one day he had worked me hard in every way he could and when i lay down i was tired and miserable and angry it all seemed so hard the next morning he came for me early and ran me round again for a long time i had scarcely had an hour's rest when he came again for me with a saddle and bridle and a new kind of bit i could never quite tell how it came about he had only just mounted me on the training ground when something i did put him out of temper and he chucked me hard with the rein the new bit was very painful and i reared up suddenly which angered him still more and he began to flog me i felt my whole spirit set against him and i began to kick and plunge and rear as i had never done before and we had a regular fight for a long time he stuck to the saddle and punished me cruelly with his whip and spurs but my blood was thoroughly up and i cared for nothing he could do if only i could get him off at last after a terrible struggle i threw him off backward i heard him fall heavily on the turf and without looking behind me i galloped off to the other end of the field there i turned round and saw my persecutor slowly rising from the ground and going into the stable i stood under an oak tree and watched but no one came to catch me the time went on and the sun was very hot the flies swarmed round me and settled on my bleeding flanks where the spurs had dug in i felt hungry for i had not eaten since the early morning but there was not enough grass in that meadow for a goose to live on i wanted to lie down and rest but with the saddle strapped tightly on there was no comfort and there was not a drop of water to drink the afternoon wore on and the sun got low i saw the other colts led in and i knew they were having a good feed at last just as the sun went down i saw the old master come out with a sieve in his hand he was a very fine old gentleman with quite white hair but his voice was what i should know him by among a thousand it was not high nor yet low but full and clear and kind and when he gave orders it was so steady and decided that every one knew both horses and men that he expected to be obeyed he came quietly along now and then shaking the oats about that he had in the sieve and speaking cheerfully and gently to me come along lassie come along lassie come along come along i stood still and let him come up he held the oats to me and i began to eat without fear his voice took all my fear away he stood by patting and stroking me while i was eating and seeing the clots of blood on my side he seemed very vexed poor lassie it was a bad business a bad business then he quietly took the rein and led me to the stable just at the door stood samson i laid my ears back and snapped at him stand back said the master and keep out of her way you've done a bad day's work for this filly he growled out something about a vicious brute hark ye said the father a bad tempered man will never make a good tempered horse you've not learned your trade yet samson then he led me into my box took off the saddle and bridle with his own hands and tied me up then he called for a pail of warm water and a sponge took off his coat and while the stable man held the pail he sponged my sides a good while so tenderly that i was sure he knew how sore and bruised they were whoa my pretty one he said stand still stand still his very voice did me good and the bathing was very comfortable the skin was so broken at the corners of my mouth that i could not eat the hay the stalks hurt me he looked closely at it shook his head and told the man to fetch a good bran mash and put some meal into it how good that mash was and so soft and healing to my mouth he stood by all the time i was eating stroking me and talking to the man if a high mettled creature like this said he can't be broken by fair means she will never be good for anything after that he often came to see me and when my mouth was healed the other breaker job they called him went on training me he was steady and thoughtful and i soon learned what he wanted 08 ginger's story continued the next time that ginger and i were together in the paddock she told me about her first place after my breaking in she said i was bought by a dealer to match another chestnut horse for some weeks he drove us together and then we were sold to a fashionable gentleman and were sent up to london i had been driven with a check rein by the dealer and i hated it worse than anything else but in this place we were reined far tighter the coachman and his master thinking we looked more stylish so we were often driven about in the park and other fashionable places you who never had a check rein on don't know what it is but i can tell you it is dreadful i like to toss my head about and hold it as high as any horse but fancy now yourself if you tossed your head up high and were obliged to hold it there and that for hours together not able to move it at all except with a jerk still higher your neck aching till you did not know how to bear it besides that to have two bits instead of one and mine was a sharp one it hurt my tongue and my jaw and the blood from my tongue colored the froth that kept flying from my lips as i chafed and fretted at the bits and rein it was worst when we had to stand by the hour waiting for our mistress at some grand party or entertainment and if i fretted or stamped with impatience the whip was laid on it was enough to drive one mad did not your master take any thought for you i said no said she he only cared to have a stylish turnout as they call it i think he knew very little about horses he left that to his coachman who told him i had an irritable temper that i had not been well broken to the check rein but i should soon get used to it but he was not the man to do it for when i was in the stable miserable and angry instead of being smoothed and quieted by kindness i got only a surly word or a blow if he had been civil i would have tried to bear it i was willing to work and ready to work hard too but to be tormented for nothing but their fancies angered me what right had they to make me suffer like that besides the soreness in my mouth and the pain in my neck it always made my windpipe feel bad and if i had stopped there long i know it would have spoiled my breathing but i grew more and more restless and irritable i could not help it and i began to snap and kick when any one came to harness me for this the groom beat me and one day as they had just buckled us into the carriage and were straining my head up with that rein i began to plunge and kick with all my might i soon broke a lot of harness and kicked myself clear so that was an end of that place after this i was sent to tattersall's to be sold of course i could not be warranted free from vice so nothing was said about that my handsome appearance and good paces soon brought a gentleman to bid for me and i was bought by another dealer he tried me in all kinds of ways and with different bits and he soon found out what i could not bear at last he drove me quite without a check rein and then sold me as a perfectly quiet horse to a gentleman in the country he was a good master and i was getting on very well but his old groom left him and a new one came this man was as hard tempered and hard handed as samson he always spoke in a rough impatient voice and if i did not move in the stall the moment he wanted me he would hit me above the hocks with his stable broom or the fork whichever he might have in his hand everything he did was rough and i began to hate him he wanted to make me afraid of him but i was too high mettled for that and one day when he had aggravated me more than usual i bit him which of course put him in a great rage and he began to hit me about the head with a riding whip after that he never dared to come into my stall again either my heels or my teeth were ready for him and he knew it i was quite quiet with my master but of course he listened to what the man said and so i was sold again the same dealer heard of me and said he thought he knew one place where i should do well twas a pity he said that such a fine horse should go to the bad for want of a real good chance and the end of it was that i came here not long before you did but i had then made up my mind that men were my natural enemies and that i must defend myself of course it is very different here but who knows how long it will last i wish i could think about things as you do but i can't after all i have gone through well i said i think it would be a real shame if you were to bite or kick john or james i don't mean to she said while they are good to me i did bite james once pretty sharp but john said try her with kindness and instead of punishing me as i expected james came to me with his arm bound up and brought me a bran mash and stroked me and i have never snapped at him since and i won't either i was sorry for ginger but of course i knew very little then and i thought most likely she made the worst of it however i found that as the weeks went on she grew much more gentle and cheerful and had lost the watchful defiant look that she used to turn on any strange person who came near her and one day james said i do believe that mare is getting fond of me she quite whinnied after me this morning when i had been rubbing her forehead ay ay jim tis the birtwick balls said john she'll be as good as black beauty by and by kindness is all the physic she wants poor thing master noticed the change too and one day when he got out of the carriage and came to speak to us as he often did he stroked her beautiful neck well my pretty one well how do things go with you now you are a good bit happier than when you came to us i think she put her nose up to him in a friendly trustful way while he rubbed it gently we shall make a cure of her john he said yes sir she's wonderfully improved she's not the same creature that she was it's the birtwick balls sir said john laughing this was a little joke of john's he used to say that a regular course of the birtwick horseballs would cure almost any vicious horse these balls he said were made up of patience and gentleness firmness and petting one pound of each to be mixed up with half a pint of common sense and given to the horse every day 09 merrylegs mr blomefield the vicar had a large family of boys and girls sometimes they used to come and play with miss jessie and flora one of the girls was as old as miss jessie two of the boys were older and there were several little ones when they came there was plenty of work for merrylegs for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock and this they would do by the hour together one afternoon he had been out with them a long time and when james brought him in and put on his halter he said there you rogue mind how you behave yourself or we shall get into trouble what have you been doing merrylegs i asked oh said he tossing his little head i have only been giving those young people a lesson they did not know when they had had enough nor when i had had enough so i just pitched them off backward that was the only thing they could understand what said i you threw the children off i thought you did know better than that did you throw miss jessie or miss flora he looked very much offended and said of course not i would not do such a thing for the best oats that ever came into the stable why i am as careful of our young ladies as the master could be and as for the little ones it is i who teach them to ride when they seem frightened or a little unsteady on my back i go as smooth and as quiet as old pussy when she is after a bird and when they are all right i go on again faster you see just to use them to it so don't you trouble yourself preaching to me i am the best friend and the best riding master those children have it is not them it is the boys boys said he shaking his mane are quite different they must be broken in as we were broken in when we were colts and just be taught what's what the other children had ridden me about for nearly two hours and then the boys thought it was their turn and so it was and i was quite agreeable they rode me by turns and i galloped them about up and down the fields and all about the orchard for a good hour they had each cut a great hazel stick for a riding whip and laid it on a little too hard but i took it in good part till at last i thought we had had enough so i stopped two or three times by way of a hint boys you see think a horse or pony is like a steam engine or a thrashing machine and can go on as long and as fast as they please they never think that a pony can get tired or have any feelings so as the one who was whipping me could not understand i just rose up on my hind legs and let him slip off behind that was all he mounted me again and i did the same then the other boy got up and as soon as he began to use his stick i laid him on the grass and so on till they were able to understand that was all they are not bad boys they don't wish to be cruel i like them very well but you see i had to give them a lesson when they brought me to james and told him i think he was very angry to see such big sticks he said they were only fit for drovers or gypsies and not for young gentlemen if i had been you said ginger i would have given those boys a good kick and that would have given them a lesson no doubt you would said merrylegs but then i am not quite such a fool begging your pardon as to anger our master or make james ashamed of me besides those children are under my charge when they are riding i tell you they are intrusted to me why only the other day i heard our master say to mrs blomefield my dear madam you need not be anxious about the children my old merrylegs will take as much care of them as you or i could i assure you i would not sell that pony for any money he is so perfectly good tempered and trustworthy and do you think i am such an ungrateful brute as to forget all the kind treatment i have had here for five"
