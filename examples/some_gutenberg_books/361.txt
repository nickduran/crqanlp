"1" "won't lose much time in having what things she wants brought down here then she'll sell the rest and put the house on the market yes of of course stammered aunt hannah pulling herself hastily to a more erect position that's what i thought too then don't you think we'd better dismiss rosa and close the house at once why yes perhaps so why not then you'd be all settled here when she comes home i'm sure the sooner you come the better i'll be pleased he smiled aunt hannah turned sharply here she ejaculated william henshaw you didn't suppose i was coming _here_ to live did you it was william's turn to look amazed why of course you're coming here where else should you go pray where i was before before billy came to you returned aunt hannah a little tremulously but with a certain dignity i shall take a room in some quiet boarding house of course nonsense aunt hannah as if billy would listen to that you came before why not come now aunt hannah lifted her chin the fraction of an inch you forget i was needed before billy is a married woman now she needs no chaperon nonsense scowled william again billy will always need you aunt hannah shook her head mournfully i like to think she wants me william but i know in my heart it isn't best why not there was a moment's pause then decisively came the answer because i think young married folks should not have outsiders in the home william laughed relievedly oh so that's it well aunt hannah you're no outsider come run right along home and pack your trunk aunt hannah was plainly almost crying but she held her ground william i can't she reiterated but billy is such a child and for once in her circumspect life aunt hannah was guilty of an interruption pardon me william she is not a child she is a woman now and she has a woman's problems to meet well then why don't you help her meet them retorted william still with a whimsical smile but aunt hannah did not smile for a minute she did not speak then with her eyes studiously averted she said william the first four years of my married life were were spoiled by an outsider in our home i don't mean to spoil billy's william relaxed visibly the smile fled from his face why aunt hannah he exclaimed the little old lady turned with a weary sigh yes i know you are shocked of course i shouldn't have told you still it is all past long ago and i wanted to make you understand why i can't come he was my husband's eldest brother a bachelor he was good and kind and meant well i suppose but he interfered with everything i was young and probably headstrong at all events there was constant friction he went away once and stayed two whole months i shall never forget the utter freedom and happiness of those months for us with the whole house to ourselves no william i can't come she rose abruptly and turned toward the door her eyes were wistful and her face was still drawn with suffering but her whole frail little self quivered plainly with high resolve john has peggy outside i must go but but aunt hannah began william helplessly she lifted a protesting hand no don't urge me please i can't come here but i believe i won't close the house till billy gets home after all she declared the next moment she was gone and william dazedly from the doorway was watching john help her into billy's automobile called by billy and half her friends peggy short for pegasus still dazedly william turned back into the house and dropped himself into the nearest chair what a curious call it had been aunt hannah had not acted like herself at all not once had she said oh my grief and conscience while the things she _had_ said someway he had never thought of aunt hannah as being young and a bride still of course she must have been once and the reason she gave for not coming there to live the pitiful story of that outsider in her home but she was no outsider she was no interfering brother of billy's william caught his breath suddenly and held it suspended then he gave a low ejaculation and half sprang from his chair spunkie disturbed from her doze by the fire uttered a purring me o ow and looked up inquiringly for a long minute william gazed dumbly into the cat's yellow sleepily contented eyes then he said with tragic distinctness spunkie it's true aunt hannah isn't billy's husband's brother but i am do you hear i _am pur r me ow commented spunkie and curled herself for another nap there was no peace for william after that in vain he told himself that he was no interfering brother and that this was his home and had been all his life in vain did he declare emphatically that he could not go he would not go that billy would not wish him to go always before his eyes was the vision of that little bride of years long gone always in his ears was the echo of aunt hannah's i shall never forget the utter freedom and happiness of those months for us with the whole house to ourselves nor turn which way he would could he find anything to comfort him simply because he was so fearfully looking for it he found it the thing that had for its theme the wretchedness that might be expected from the presence of a third person in the new home poor william everywhere he met it the hint the word the story the song even and always it added its mite to the woeful whole even the hoariest of mother in law jokes had its sting for him and to make his cup quite full he chanced to remember one day what marie had said when he had suggested that she and cyril come to the strata to live no i think young folks should begin by themselves unhappy indeed were these days for william like a lost spirit he wandered from room to room touching this fingering that for long minutes he would stand before some picture or some treasured bit of old mahogany as if to stamp indelibly upon his mind a thing that was soon to be no more at other times like a man without a home he would go out into the common or the public garden and sit for hours on some bench thinking all this could have but one ending of course before the middle of august william summoned pete to his rooms oh pete i'm going to move next week he began nonchalantly his voice sounded as if moving were a pleasurable circumstance that occurred in his life regularly once a month i'd like you to begin to pack up these things please to morrow the old servant's mouth fell open you're goin to to what sir he stammered move _move_ i said william spoke with unusual harshness pete wet his lips you mean you've sold the old place sir that we we ain't goin to live here no longer sold of course not _i'm_ going to move away not you if pete could have known what caused the sharpness in his master's voice he would not have been so grieved or rather he would have been grieved for a different reason as it was he could only falter miserably _you_ are goin to move away from here yes yes man why pete what ails you one would think a body never moved before they didn't not you sir william turned abruptly so that his face could not be seen with stern deliberation he picked up an elaborately decorated teapot but the valuable bit of lowestoft shook so in his hand that he set it down at once it clicked sharply against its neighbor betraying his nervous hand pete stirred but mr william he stammered thickly how are you what'll you do without there doesn't nobody but me know so well about your tea and the two lumps in your coffee and there's your flannels that you never put on till i get em out and the woolen socks that you'd wear all summer if i didn't hide em and and who's goin to take care of these he finished with a glance that encompassed the overflowing cabinets and shelves of curios all about him his master smiled sadly an affection that had its inception in his boyhood days shone in his eyes the hand in which the lowestoft had shaken rested now heavily on an old man's bent shoulder a shoulder that straightened itself in unconscious loyalty under the touch pete you have spoiled me and no mistake i don't expect to find another like you but maybe if i wear the woolen socks too late you'll come and hunt up the others for me eh and with a smile that was meant to be quizzical william turned and began to shift the teapots about again but mr william why that is what will mr bertram and miss billy do without you ventured the old man there was a sudden tinkling crash on the floor lay the fragments of a silver luster teapot the servant exclaimed aloud in dismay but his master did not even glance toward his once treasured possession on the floor nonsense pete he was saying in a particularly cheery voice have you lived all these years and not found out that newly married folks don't _need_ any one else around come do you suppose we could begin to pack these teapots to night he added a little feverishly aren't there some boxes down cellar i'll see sir said pete respectfully but the expression on his face as he turned away showed that he was not thinking of teapots nor of boxes in which to pack them chapter iii billy speaks her mind mr and mrs bertram henshaw were expected home the first of september by the thirty first of august the old beacon street homestead facing the public garden was in spick and span order with dong ling in the basement hovering over a well stocked larder and pete searching the rest of the house for a chair awry or a bit of dust undiscovered twice before had the strata as bertram long ago dubbed the home of his boyhood been prepared for the coming of billy william's namesake once when it had been decorated with guns and fishing rods to welcome the boy who turned out to be a girl and again when with pink roses and sewing baskets the three brothers got joyously ready for a feminine billy who did not even come at all the house had been very different then it had been indeed a strata with its distinctive layers of fads and pursuits as represented by bertram and his painting on one floor william and his curios on another and cyril with his music on a third cyril was gone now only pete and his humble belongings occupied the top floor the floor below too was silent now and almost empty save for a rug or two and a few pieces of heavy furniture that william had not cared to take with him to his new quarters on top of beacon hill below this however came billy's old rooms and on these pete had lavished all his skill and devotion freshly laundered curtains were at the windows dustless rugs were on the floor the old work basket had been brought down from the top floor storeroom and the long closed piano stood invitingly open in a conspicuous place also sat the little green god upon whose exquisitely carved shoulders was supposed to rest the heap plenty velly good luckee of dong ling's prophecy on the first floor bertram's old rooms and the drawing room came in for their share of the general overhauling even spunkie did not escape but had to submit to the ignominy of a bath and then dawned fair and clear the first day of september bringing at five o'clock the bride and groom respectfully lined up in the hall to meet them were pete and dong ling pete with his wrinkled old face alight with joy and excitement dong ling grinning and kotowing and chanting in a high pitched treble miss billee miss billee plenty much welcome miss billee yes welcome home mrs _henshaw bowed bertram turning at the door with an elaborate flourish that did not in the least hide his tender pride in his new wife billy laughed and colored a pretty pink thank you all of you she cried a little unsteadily and how good good everything does look to me why where's uncle william she broke off casting hurriedly anxious eyes about her well i should say so echoed bertram where is he pete he isn't sick is he a quick change crossed the old servant's face he shook his head dumbly billy gave a gleeful laugh i know he's asleep she caroled skipping to the bottom of the stairway and looking up ho uncle william better wake up sir the folks have come pete cleared his throat mr william isn't here miss ma'am he corrected miserably billy smiled but she frowned too not here well i like that she pouted and when i've brought him the most beautiful pair of mirror knobs he ever saw and all the way in my bag too so i could give them to him the very first thing she added darting over to the small bag she had brought in with her i'm glad i did too for our trunks didn't come she continued laughingly still if he isn't here to receive them there pete aren't they beautiful she cried carefully taking from their wrappings two exquisitely decorated porcelain discs mounted on two long spikes they're batterseas the real article i know enough for that and they're finer than anything he's got won't he be pleased yes miss ma'am i mean stammered the old man these new titles come hard don't they pete laughed bertram pete smiled faintly never mind pete soothed his new mistress you shall call me miss billy all your life if you want to bertram she added turning to her husband i'm going to just run up stairs and put these in uncle william's rooms so they'll be there when he comes in we'll see how soon he discovers them before pete could stop her she was half way up the first flight of stairs even then he tried to speak to his young master to explain that mr william was not living there but the words refused to come he could only stand dumbly waiting in a minute it came billy's sharp startled cry bertram bertram bertram sprang for the stairway but he had not reached the top when he met his wife coming down she was white faced and trembling bertram those rooms there's not so much as a teapot there uncle william's gone gone bertram wheeled sharply pete what is the meaning of this where is my brother to hear him one would think he suspected the old servant of having hidden his master pete lifted a shaking hand and fumbled with his collar he's moved sir moved oh you mean to other rooms to cyril's bertram relaxed visibly he's upstairs maybe pete shook his head no sir he's moved away out of the house sir for a brief moment bertram stared as if he could not believe what his ears had heard then step by step he began to descend the stairs do you mean to say that my brother has moved gone away _left_ his _home he demanded yes sir billy gave a low cry but why why she choked almost stumbling headlong down the stairway in her effort to reach the two men at the bottom pete why did he go there was no answer pete bertram's voice was very sharp what is the meaning of this do you know why my brother left his home the old man wet his lips and swallowed chokingly but he did not speak i'm waiting pete billy laid one hand on the old servant's arm in the other hand she still tightly clutched the mirror knobs pete if you do know won't you tell us please she begged pete looked down at the hand then up at the troubled young face with the beseeching eyes his own features worked convulsively with a visible effort he cleared his throat i know what he said he stammered his eyes averted what was it there was no answer look here pete you'll have to tell us you know cut in bertram decisively so you might as well do it now as ever once more pete cleared his throat this time the words came in a burst of desperation yes sir i understand sir it was only that he said he said as how young folks didn't _need_ any one else around so he was goin didn't _need_ any one else exclaimed bertram plainly not comprehending yes sir you two bein married so now pete's eyes were still averted billy gave a low cry you mean because _i_ came she demanded why yes miss no that is pete stopped with an appealing glance at bertram then it was it _was_ on account of _me_ choked billy pete looked still more distressed no no he faltered it was only that he thought you wouldn't want him here now want him here ejaculated bertram want him here echoed billy with a sob pete where is he as she asked the question she dropped the mirror knobs into her open bag and reached for her coat and gloves she had not removed her hat pete gave the address it's just down the street a bit and up the hill he added excitedly divining her purpose it's a sort of a boarding house i reckon a _boarding house_ for uncle william scorned billy her eyes ablaze come bertram we'll see about that bertram reached out a detaining hand but dearest you're so tired he demurred hadn't we better wait till after dinner or till to morrow after dinner to morrow billy's eyes blazed anew why bertram henshaw do you think i'd leave that dear man even one minute longer if i could help it with a notion in his blessed old head that we didn't _want_ him but you said a little while ago you had a headache dear still objected bertram if you'd just eat your dinner dinner choked billy i wonder if you think i could eat any dinner with uncle william turned out of his home i'm going to find uncle william and she stumbled blindly toward the door bertram reached for his hat he threw a despairing glance into pete's eyes we'll be back when we can he said with a frown yes sir answered pete respectfully then as if impelled by some hidden force he touched his master's arm it was that way she looked sir when she came to _you_ that night last july with her eyes all shining he whispered a tender smile curved bertram's lips the frown vanished from his face bless you pete and bless her too he whispered back the next moment he had hurried after his wife the house that bore the number pete had given proved to have a pretentious doorway and a landlady who in response to the summons of the neat maid appeared with a most impressive rustle of black silk and jet bugles no mr william henshaw was not in his rooms in fact he was very seldom there his business she believed called him to state street through the day outside of that she had been told he spent much time sitting on a bench in the common doubtless if they cared to search they could find him there now a bench in the common indeed stormed billy as she and bertram hurried down the wide stone steps uncle william on a bench but surely now dear ventured her husband you'll come home and get your dinner billy turned indignantly and leave uncle william on a bench in the common indeed no why bertram you wouldn't either she cried as she turned resolutely toward one of the entrances to the common and bertram with the eyes all shining still before him could only murmur no of course not dear and follow obediently where she led under ordinary circumstances it would have been a delightful hour for a walk the sun had almost set and the shadows lay long across the grass the air was cool and unusually bracing for a day so early in september but all this was lost on bertram bertram did not wish to take a walk he was hungry he wanted his dinner and he wanted too his old home with his new wife flitting about the rooms as he had pictured this first evening together he wanted william of course certainly he wanted william but if william would insist on running away and sitting on park benches in this ridiculous fashion he ought to take the consequences until to morrow five ten fifteen minutes passed up one path and down another trudged the anxious eyed billy and her increasingly impatient husband then when the fifteen weary minutes had become a still more weary half hour the bonds bertram had set on his temper snapped billy he remonstrated despairingly do please come home don't you see how highly improbable it is that we should happen on william if we walked like this all night he might move change his seat go home even he probably has gone home and surely never before did a bride insist on spending the first evening after her return tramping up and down a public park for hour after hour like this looking for any man _won't_ you come home but billy had not even heard with a glad little cry she had darted to the side of the humped up figure of a man alone on a park bench just ahead of them uncle william oh uncle william how could you she cried dropping herself on to one end of the seat and catching the man's arm in both her hands yes how could you demanded bertram with just a touch of irritation dropping himself on to the other end of the seat and catching the man's other arm in his one usable hand the bent shoulders and bowed head straightened up with a jerk well well bless my soul if it isn't our little bride cried uncle william fondly and the happy bridegroom too when did you get home we haven't got home retorted bertram promptly before his wife could speak oh we looked in at the door an hour or so back but we didn't stay we've been hunting for you ever since nonsense children uncle william spoke with gay cheeriness but he refused to meet either billy's or bertram's eyes uncle william how could you do it reproached billy again do what uncle william was plainly fencing for time leave the house like that ho i wanted a change as if we'd believe that scoffed billy all right let's call it you've had the change then laughed bertram and we'll send over for your things to morrow come now let's go home to dinner william shook his head he essayed a gay smile why i've only just begun i'm going to stay oh i don't know how long i'm going to stay he finished blithely billy lifted her chin a little uncle william you aren't playing square pete told us what you said when you left eh what william looked up with startled eyes about about our not _needing_ you so we know now why you left and we _sha'n't stand_ it pete that oh that that's nonsense i i'll settle with pete billy laughed softly poor pete don't we simply dragged it out of him and now we're here to tell you that we _do_ want you and that you _must_ come back again william shook his head a swift shadow crossed his face thank you no children he said dully you're very kind but you don't need me i should be just an interfering elder brother i should spoil your young married life william's voice now sounded as if he were reciting a well learned lesson if i went away and stayed two months you'd never forget the utter freedom and joy of those two whole months with the house all to yourselves uncle william gasped billy what _are_ you talking about about about my not going back of course but you are coming back cut in bertram almost angrily oh come will this is utter nonsense and you know it come let's go home to dinner a stern look came to the corners of william's mouth a look that bertram understood well all right i'll go to dinner of course but i sha'n't stay said william firmly i've thought it all out i know i'm right come we'll go to dinner now and say no more about it he finished with a cheery smile as he rose to his feet then to the bride he added did you have a nice trip little girl billy too had risen now but she did not seem to have heard his question in the fast falling twilight her face looked a little white uncle william she began very quietly do you think for a minute that just because i married your brother i am going to live in that house and turn you out of the home you've lived in all your life nonsense dear i'm not turned out i just go corrected uncle william gayly with superb disdain billy brushed this aside oh no you won't she declared but _i shall_ billy gasped bertram my my dear expostulated william faintly uncle william bertram listen panted billy i never told you much before but i'm going to now long ago when i went away with aunt hannah your sister kate showed me how dear the old home was to you how much you thought of it and she said she said that i had upset everything bertram interjected a sharp word but billy paid no attention that's why i went and _i shall go again_ if you don't come home to morrow to stay uncle william come now let's go to dinner please bertram's hungry she finished with a bright smile there was a tense moment of silence william glanced at bertram bertram returned the glance with interest er ah yes well we might go to dinner stammered william after a minute er yes agreed bertram and the three fell into step together chapter iv just like billy billy did not leave the strata this time before twenty four hours had passed the last cherished fragment of mr william henshaw's possessions had been carefully carried down the imposing steps of the beacon hill boarding house under the disapproving eyes of its bugle adorned mistress who found herself now with a month's advance rent and two vacant parlors on her hands before another twenty four hours had passed her quondam boarder with a tired sigh sank into his favorite morris chair in his old familiar rooms and looked about him with contented eyes every treasure was in place from the traditional four small stones of his babyhood days to the batterseas billy had just brought him pete as of yore was hovering near with a dust cloth bertram's gay whistle sounded from the floor below william henshaw was at home again this much accomplished billy went to see aunt hannah aunt hannah greeted her affectionately though with tearfully troubled eyes she was wearing a gray shawl to day topped with a black one sure sign of unrest either physical or mental as all her friends knew i'd begun to think you'd forgotten me she faltered with a poor attempt at gayety you've been home three whole days i know dearie smiled billy and twas a shame but i have been so busy my trunks came at last and i've been helping uncle william get settled too aunt hannah looked puzzled uncle william get settled you mean he's changed his room billy laughed oddly and threw a swift glance into aunt hannah's face well yes he did change she murmured but he's moved back now into the old quarters er you haven't heard from uncle william then lately i take it no aunt hannah shook her head abstractedly i did see him once several weeks ago but i haven't since we had quite a talk then and billy i've been wanting to speak to you she hurried on a little feverishly i didn't like to leave of course till you did come home as long as you'd said nothing about your plans but leave interposed billy dazedly leave where what do you mean why leave here of course dear i mean i didn't like to get my room while you were away but i shall now of course at once nonsense aunt hannah as if i'd let you do that laughed billy aunt hannah stiffened perceptibly her lips looked suddenly thin and determined even the soft little curls above her ears seemed actually to bristle with resolution billy she began firmly we might as well understand each other at once i know your good heart and i appreciate your kindness but i can not come to"
