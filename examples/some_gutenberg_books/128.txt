"1" "this merchant when the first old man had finished his story the second who was leading the two black dogs said to the genius i am going to tell you what happened to me and i am sure that you will find my story even more astonishing than the one to which you have just been listening but when i have related it will you grant me also the third part of the merchant's punishment yes replied the genius provided that your story surpasses that of the hind with this agreement the second old man began in this way the story of the second old man and of the two black dogs great prince of the genii you must know that we are three brothers these two black dogs and myself our father died leaving us each a thousand sequins with this sum we all three took up the same profession and became merchants a short time after we had opened our shops my eldest brother one of these two dogs resolved to travel in foreign countries for the sake of merchandise with this intention he sold all he had and bought merchandise suitable to the voyages he was about to make he set out and was away a whole year at the end of this time a beggar came to my shop good day i said good day he answered is it possible that you do not recognise me then i looked at him closely and saw he was my brother i made him come into my house and asked him how he had fared in his enterprise do not question me he replied see me you see all i have it would but renew my trouble to tell of all the misfortunes that have befallen me in a year and have brought me to this state i shut up my shop paid him every attention taking him to the bath giving him my most beautiful robes i examined my accounts and found that i had doubled my capital that is that i now possessed two thousand sequins i gave my brother half saying now brother you can forget your losses he accepted them with joy and we lived together as we had before some time afterwards my second brother wished also to sell his business and travel my eldest brother and i did all we could to dissuade him but it was of no use he joined a caravan and set out he came back at the end of a year in the same state as his elder brother i took care of him and as i had a thousand sequins to spare i gave them to him and he re opened his shop one day my two brothers came to me to propose that we should make a journey and trade at first i refused to go you travelled i said and what did you gain but they came to me repeatedly and after having held out for five years i at last gave way but when they had made their preparation and they began to buy the merchandise we needed they found they had spent every piece of the thousand sequins i had given them i did not reproach them i divided my six thousand sequins with them giving a thousand to each and keeping one for myself and the other three i buried in a corner of my house we bought merchandise loaded a vessel with it and set forth with a favorable wind after two months sailing we arrived at a seaport where we disembarked and did a great trade then we bought the merchandise of the country and were just going to sail once more when i was stopped on the shore by a beautiful though poorly dressed woman she came up to me kissed my hand and implored me to marry her and take her on board at first i refused but she begged so hard and promised to be such a good wife to me that at last i consented i got her some beautiful dresses and after having married her we embarked and set sail during the voyage i discovered so many good qualities in my wife that i began to love her more and more but my brothers began to be jealous of my prosperity and set to work to plot against my life one night when we were sleeping they threw my wife and myself into the sea my wife however was a fairy and so she did not let me drown but transported me to an island when the day dawned she said to me when i saw you on the sea shore i took a great fancy to you and wished to try your good nature so i presented myself in the disguise you saw now i have rewarded you by saving your life but i am very angry with your brothers and i shall not rest till i have taken their lives i thanked the fairy for all that she had done for me but i begged her not to kill my brothers i appeased her wrath and in a moment she transported me from the island where we were to the roof of my house and she disappeared a moment afterwards i went down and opened the doors and dug up the three thousand sequins which i had buried i went to the place where my shop was opened it and received from my fellow merchants congratulations on my return when i went home i saw two black dogs who came to meet me with sorrowful faces i was much astonished but the fairy who reappeared said to me do not be surprised to see these dogs they are your two brothers i have condemned them to remain for ten years in these shapes then having told me where i could hear news of her she vanished the ten years are nearly passed and i am on the road to find her as in passing i met this merchant and the old man with the hind i stayed with them this is my history o prince of genii do you not think it is a most marvellous one yes indeed replied the genius and i will give up to you the third of the merchant's punishment then the third old man made the genius the same request as the other two had done and the genius promised him the last third of the merchant's punishment if his story surpassed both the others so he told his story to the genius but i cannot tell you what it was as i do not know but i do know that it was even more marvellous than either of the others so that the genius was astonished and said to the third old man i will give up to you the third part of the merchant's punishment he ought to thank all three of you for having interested yourselves in his favour but for you he would be here no longer so saying he disappeared to the great joy of the company the merchant did not fail to thank his friends and then each went on his way the merchant returned to his wife and children and passed the rest of his days happily with them but sire added scheherazade however beautiful are the stories i have just told you they cannot compare with the story of the fisherman the story of the fisherman sire there was once upon a time a fisherman so old and so poor that he could scarcely manage to support his wife and three children he went every day to fish very early and each day he made a rule not to throw his nets more than four times he started out one morning by moonlight and came to the sea shore he undressed and threw his nets and as he was drawing them towards the bank he felt a great weight he though he had caught a large fish and he felt very pleased but a moment afterwards seeing that instead of a fish he only had in his nets the carcase of an ass he was much disappointed vexed with having such a bad haul when he had mended his nets which the carcase of the ass had broken in several places he threw them a second time in drawing them in he again felt a great weight so that he thought they were full of fish but he only found a large basket full of rubbish he was much annoyed o fortune he cried do not trifle thus with me a poor fisherman who can hardly support his family so saying he threw away the rubbish and after having washed his nets clean of the dirt he threw them for the third time but he only drew in stones shells and mud he was almost in despair then he threw his nets for the fourth time when he thought he had a fish he drew them in with a great deal of trouble there was no fish however but he found a yellow pot which by its weight seemed full of something and he noticed that it was fastened and sealed with lead with the impression of a seal he was delighted i will sell it to the founder he said with the money i shall get for it i shall buy a measure of wheat he examined the jar on all sides he shook it to see if it would rattle but he heard nothing and so judging from the impression of the seal and the lid he thought there must be something precious inside to find out he took his knife and with a little trouble he opened it he turned it upside down but nothing came out which surprised him very much he set it in front of him and whilst he was looking at it attentively such a thick smoke came out that he had to step back a pace or two this smoke rose up to the clouds and stretching over the sea and the shore formed a thick mist which caused the fisherman much astonishment when all the smoke was out of the jar it gathered itself together and became a thick mass in which appeared a genius twice as large as the largest giant when he saw such a terrible looking monster the fisherman would like to have run away but he trembled so with fright that he could not move a step great king of the genii cried the monster i will never again disobey you at these words the fisherman took courage what is this you are saying great genius tell me your history and how you came to be shut up in that vase at this the genius looked at the fisherman haughtily speak to me more civilly he said before i kill you alas why should you kill me cried the fisherman i have just freed you have you already forgotten that no answered the genius but that will not prevent me from killing you and i am only going to grant you one favour and that is to choose the manner of your death but what have i done to you asked the fisherman i cannot treat you in any other way said the genius and if you would know why listen to my story i rebelled against the king of the genii to punish me he shut me up in this vase of copper and he put on the leaden cover his seal which is enchantment enough to prevent my coming out then he had the vase thrown into the sea during the first period of my captivity i vowed that if anyone should free me before a hundred years were passed i would make him rich even after his death but that century passed and no one freed me in the second century i vowed that i would give all the treasures in the world to my deliverer but he never came in the third i promised to make him a king to be always near him and to grant him three wishes every day but that century passed away as the other two had done and i remained in the same plight at last i grew angry at being captive for so long and i vowed that if anyone would release me i would kill him at once and would only allow him to choose in what manner he should die so you see as you have freed me to day choose in what way you will die the fisherman was very unhappy what an unlucky man i am to have freed you i implore you to spare my life i have told you said the genius that it is impossible choose quickly you are wasting time the fisherman began to devise a plot since i must die he said before i choose the manner of my death i conjure you on your honour to tell me if you really were in that vase yes i was answered the genius i really cannot believe it said the fisherman that vase could not contain one of your feet even and how could your whole body go in i cannot believe it unless i see you do the thing then the genius began to change himself into smoke which as before spread over the sea and the shore and which then collecting itself together began to go back into the vase slowly and evenly till there was nothing left outside then a voice came from the vase which said to the fisherman well unbelieving fisherman here i am in the vase do you believe me now the fisherman instead of answering took the lid of lead and shut it down quickly on the vase now o genius he cried ask pardon of me and choose by what death you will die but no it will be better if i throw you into the sea whence i drew you out and i will build a house on the shore to warn fishermen who come to cast their nets here against fishing up such a wicked genius as you are who vows to kill the man who frees you at these words the genius did all he could to get out but he could not because of the enchantment of the lid then he tried to get out by cunning if you will take off the cover he said i will repay you no answered the fisherman if i trust myself to you i am afraid you will treat me as a certain greek king treated the physician douban listen and i will tell you the story of the greek king and the physician douban in the country of zouman in persia there lived a greek king this king was a leper and all his doctors had been unable to cure him when a very clever physician came to his court he was very learned in all languages and knew a great deal about herbs and medicines as soon as he was told of the king's illness he put on his best robe and presented himself before the king sire said he i know that no physician has been able to cure your majesty but if you will follow my instructions i will promise to cure you without any medicines or outward application the king listened to this proposal if you are clever enough to do this he said i promise to make you and your descendants rich for ever the physician went to his house and made a polo club the handle of which he hollowed out and put in it the drug he wished to use then he made a ball and with these things he went the next day to the king he told him that he wished him to play at polo accordingly the king mounted his horse and went into the place where he played there the physician approached him with the bat he had made saying take this sire and strike the ball till you feel your hand and whole body in a glow when the remedy that is in the handle of the club is warmed by your hand it will penetrate throughout your body the you must return to your palace bathe and go to sleep and when you awake to morrow morning you will be cured the king took the club and urged his horse after the ball which he had thrown he struck it and then it was hit back by the courtiers who were playing with him when he felt very hot he stopped playing and went back to the palace went into the bath and did all that the physician had said the next day when he arose he found to his great joy and astonishment that he was completely cured when he entered his audience chamber all his courtiers who were eager to see if the wonderful cure had been effected were overwhelmed with joy the physician douban entered the hall and bowed low to the ground the king seeing him called him made him sit by his side and showed him every mark of honour that evening he gave him a long and rich robe of state and presented him with two thousand sequins the following day he continued to load him with favours now the king had a grand vizir who was avaricious and envious and a very bad man he grew extremely jealous of the physician and determined to bring about his ruin in order to do this he asked to speak in private with the king saying that he had a most important communication to make what is it asked the king sire answered the grand vizir it is most dangerous for a monarch to confide in a man whose faithfulness is not proved you do not know that this physician is not a traitor come here to assassinate you i am sure said the king that this man is the most faithful and virtuous of men if he wished to take my life why did he cure me cease to speak against him i see what it is you are jealous of him but do not think that i can be turned against him i remember well what a vizir said to king sindbad his master to prevent him from putting the prince his son to death what the greek king said excited the vizir's curiosity and he said to him sire i beg your majesty to have the condescension to tell me what the vizir said to king sindbad this vizir he replied told king sindbad that one ought not believe everything that a mother in law says and told him this story the story of the husband and the parrot a good man had a beautiful wife whom he loved passionately and never left if possible one day when he was obliged by important business to go away from her he went to a place where all kinds of birds are sold and bought a parrot this parrot not only spoke well but it had the gift of telling all that had been done before it he brought it home in a cage and asked his wife to put it in her room and take great care of it while he was away then he departed on his return he asked the parrot what had happened during his absence and the parrot told him some things which made him scold his wife she thought that one of her slaves must have been telling tales of her but they told her it was the parrot and she resolved to revenge herself on him when her husband next went away for one day she told on slave to turn under the bird's cage a hand mill another to throw water down from above the cage and a third to take a mirror and turn it in front of its eyes from left to right by the light of a candle the slaves did this for part of the night and did it very well the next day when the husband came back he asked the parrot what he had seen the bird replied my good master the lightning thunder and rain disturbed me so much all night long that i cannot tell you what i have suffered the husband who knew that it had neither rained nor thundered in the night was convinced that the parrot was not speaking the truth so he took him out of the cage and threw him so roughly on the ground that he killed him nevertheless he was sorry afterwards for he found that the parrot had spoken the truth when the greek king said the fisherman to the genius had finished the story of the parrot he added to the vizir and so vizir i shall not listen to you and i shall take care of the physician in case i repent as the husband did when he had killed the parrot but the vizir was determined sire he replied the death of the parrot was nothing but when it is a question of the life of a king it is better to sacrifice the innocent than save the guilty it is no uncertain thing however the physician douban wishes to assassinate you my zeal prompts me to disclose this to your majesty if i am wrong i deserve to be punished as a vizir was once punished what had the vizir done said the greek king to merit the punishment i will tell your majesty if you will do me the honour to listen answered the vizir the story of the vizir who was punished there was once upon a time a king who had a son who was very fond of hunting he often allowed him to indulge in this pastime but he had ordered his grand vizir always to go with him and never to lose sight of him one day the huntsman roused a stag and the prince thinking that the vizir was behind gave chase and rode so hard that he found himself alone he stopped and having lost sight of it he turned to rejoin the vizir who had not been careful enough to follow him but he lost his way whilst he was trying to find it he saw on the side of the road a beautiful lady who was crying bitterly he drew his horse's rein and asked her who she was and what she was doing in this place and if she needed help i am the daughter of an indian king she answered and whilst riding in the country i fell asleep and tumbled off my horse has run away and i do not know what has become of him the young prince had pity on her and offered to take her behind him which he did as they passed by a ruined building the lady dismounted and went in the prince also dismounted and followed her to his great surprise he heard her saying to some one inside rejoice my children i am bringing you a nice fat youth and other voices replied where is he mamma that we may eat him at once as we are very hungry the prince at once saw the danger he was in he now knew that the lady who said she was the daughter of an indian king was an ogress who lived in desolate places and who by a thousand wiles surprised and devoured passers by he was terrified and threw himself on his horse the pretended princess appeared at this moment and seeing that she had lost her prey she said to him do not be afraid what do you want i am lost he answered and i am looking for the road keep straight on said the ogress and you will find it the prince could hardly believe his ears and rode off as hard as he could he found his way and arrived safe and sound at his father's house where he told him of the danger he had run because of the grand vizir's carelessness the king was very angry and had him strangled immediately sire went on the vizir to the greek king to return to the physician douban if you do not take care you will repent of having trusted him who knows what this remedy with which he has cured you may not in time have a bad effect on you the greek king was naturally very weak and did not perceive the wicked intention of his vizir nor was he firm enough to keep to his first resolution well vizir he said you are right perhaps he did come to take my life he might do it by the mere smell of one of his drugs i must see what can be done the best means sire to put your life in security is to send for him at once and to cut off his head directly he comes said the vizir i really think replied the king that will be the best way he then ordered one of his ministers to fetch the physician who came at once i have had you sent for said the king in order to free myself from you by taking your life the physician was beyond measure astonished when he heard he was to die what crimes have i committed your majesty i have learnt replied the king that you are a spy and intend to kill me but i will be first and kill you strike he added to an executioner who was by and rid me of this assassin at this cruel order the physician threw himself on his knees spare my life he cried and yours will be spared the fisherman stopped here to say to the genius you see what passed between the greek king and the physician has just passed between us two the greek king he went on had no mercy on him and the executioner bound his eyes all those present begged for his life but in vain the physician on his knees and bound said to the king at least let me put my affairs in order and leave my books to persons who will make good use of them there is one which i should like to present to your majesty it is very precious and ought to be kept carefully in your treasury it contains many curious things the chief being that when you cut off my head if your majesty will turn to the sixth leaf and read the third line of the left hand page my head will answer all the questions you like to ask it the king eager to see such a wonderful thing put off his execution to the next day and sent him under a strong guard to his house there the physician put his affairs in order and the next day there was a great crowd assembled in the hall to see his death and the doings after it the physician went up to the foot of the throne with a large book in his hand he carried a basin on which he spread the covering of the book and presenting it to the king said sire take this book and when my head is cut off let it be placed in the basin on the covering of this book as soon as it is there the blood will cease to flow then open the book and my head will answer your questions but sire i implore your mercy for i am innocent your prayers are useless and if it were only to hear your head speak when you are dead you should die so saying he took the book from the physician's hands and ordered the executioner to do his duty the head was so cleverly cut off that it fell into the basin and directly the blood ceased to flow then to the great astonishment of the king the eyes opened and the head said your majesty open the book the king did so and finding that the first leaf stuck against the second he put his finger in his mouth to turn it more easily he did the same thing till he reached the sixth page and not seeing any writing on it physician he said there is no writing turn over a few more pages answered the head the king went on turning still putting his finger in his mouth till the poison in which each page was dipped took effect his sight failed him and he fell at the foot of his throne when the physician's head saw that the poison had taken effect and that the king had only a few more minutes to live tyrant it cried see how cruelty and injustice are punished scarcely had it uttered these words than the king died and the head lost also the little life that had remained in it that is the end of the story of the greek king and now let us return to the fisherman and the genius if the greek king said the fisherman had spared the physician he would not have thus died the same thing applies to you now i am going to throw you into the sea my friend said the genius do not do such a cruel thing do not treat me as imma treated ateca what did imma do to ateca asked the fisherman do you think i can tell you while i am shut up in here replied the genius let me out and i will make you"
