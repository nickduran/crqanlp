"1" "i sought my subterranean sleeping chamber and exchanging my costume for a comfortable dressing gown sat down to read the letters by the evening mail which sawyer had laid on my reading table one of them was from the builder of my new house and confirmed what i had inferred from the newspaper item the new strikes he said had postponed indefinitely the completion of the contract as neither masters nor workmen would concede the point at issue without a long struggle caligula wished that the roman people had but one neck that he might cut it off and as i read this letter i am afraid that for a moment i was capable of wishing the same thing concerning the laboring classes of america the return of sawyer with the doctor interrupted my gloomy meditations it appeared that he had with difficulty been able to secure his services as he was preparing to leave the city that very night the doctor explained that since he had seen me last he had learned of a fine professional opening in a distant city and decided to take prompt advantage of it on my asking in some panic what i was to do for some one to put me to sleep he gave me the names of several mesmerizers in boston who he averred had quite as great powers as he somewhat relieved on this point i instructed sawyer to rouse me at nine o'clock next morning and lying down on the bed in my dressing gown assumed a comfortable attitude and surrendered myself to the manipulations of the mesmerizer owing perhaps to my unusually nervous state i was slower than common in losing consciousness but at length a delicious drowsiness stole over me chapter 3 he is going to open his eyes he had better see but one of us at first promise me then that you will not tell him the first voice was a man's the second a woman's and both spoke in whispers i will see how he seems replied the man no no promise me persisted the other let her have her way whispered a third voice also a woman well well i promise then answered the man quick go he is coming out of it there was a rustle of garments and i opened my eyes a fine looking man of perhaps sixty was bending over me an expression of much benevolence mingled with great curiosity upon his features he was an utter stranger i raised myself on an elbow and looked around the room was empty i certainly had never been in it before or one furnished like it i looked back at my companion he smiled how do you feel he inquired where am i i demanded you are in my house was the reply how came i here we will talk about that when you are stronger meanwhile i beg you will feel no anxiety you are among friends and in good hands how do you feel a bit queerly i replied but i am well i suppose will you tell me how i came to be indebted to your hospitality what has happened to me how came i here it was in my own house that i went to sleep there will be time enough for explanations later my unknown host replied with a reassuring smile it will be better to avoid agitating talk until you are a little more yourself will you oblige me by taking a couple of swallows of this mixture it will do you good i am a physician i repelled the glass with my hand and sat up on the couch although with an effort for my head was strangely light i insist upon knowing at once where i am and what you have been doing with me i said my dear sir responded my companion let me beg that you will not agitate yourself i would rather you did not insist upon explanations so soon but if you do i will try to satisfy you provided you will first take this draught which will strengthen you somewhat i thereupon drank what he offered me then he said it is not so simple a matter as you evidently suppose to tell you how you came here you can tell me quite as much on that point as i can tell you you have just been roused from a deep sleep or more properly trance so much i can tell you you say you were in your own house when you fell into that sleep may i ask you when that was when i replied when why last evening of course at about ten o'clock i left my man sawyer orders to call me at nine o'clock what has become of sawyer i can't precisely tell you that replied my companion regarding me with a curious expression but i am sure that he is excusable for not being here and now can you tell me a little more explicitly when it was that you fell into that sleep the date i mean why last night of course i said so didn't i that is unless i have overslept an entire day great heavens that cannot be possible and yet i have an odd sensation of having slept a long time it was decoration day that i went to sleep decoration day yes monday the 30th pardon me the 30th of what why of this month of course unless i have slept into june but that can't be this month is september september you don't mean that i've slept since may god in heaven why it is incredible we shall see replied my companion you say that it was may 30th when you went to sleep yes may i ask of what year i stared blankly at him incapable of speech for some moments of what year i feebly echoed at last yes of what year if you please after you have told me that i shall be able to tell you how long you have slept it was the year 1887 i said my companion insisted that i should take another draught from the glass and felt my pulse my dear sir he said your manner indicates that you are a man of culture which i am aware was by no means the matter of course in your day it now is no doubt then you have yourself made the observation that nothing in this world can be truly said to be more wonderful than anything else the causes of all phenomena are equally adequate and the results equally matters of course that you should be startled by what i shall tell you is to be expected but i am confident that you will not permit it to affect your equanimity unduly your appearance is that of a young man of barely thirty and your bodily condition seems not greatly different from that of one just roused from a somewhat too long and profound sleep and yet this is the tenth day of september in the year 2000 and you have slept exactly one hundred and thirteen years three months and eleven days feeling partially dazed i drank a cup of some sort of broth at my companion's suggestion and immediately afterward becoming very drowsy went off into a deep sleep when i awoke it was broad daylight in the room which had been lighted artificially when i was awake before my mysterious host was sitting near he was not looking at me when i opened my eyes and i had a good opportunity to study him and meditate upon my extraordinary situation before he observed that i was awake my giddiness was all gone and my mind perfectly clear the story that i had been asleep one hundred and thirteen years which in my former weak and bewildered condition i had accepted without question recurred to me now only to be rejected as a preposterous attempt at an imposture the motive of which it was impossible remotely to surmise something extraordinary had certainly happened to account for my waking up in this strange house with this unknown companion but my fancy was utterly impotent to suggest more than the wildest guess as to what that something might have been could it be that i was the victim of some sort of conspiracy it looked so certainly and yet if human lineaments ever gave true evidence it was certain that this man by my side with a face so refined and ingenuous was no party to any scheme of crime or outrage then it occurred to me to question if i might not be the butt of some elaborate practical joke on the part of friends who had somehow learned the secret of my underground chamber and taken this means of impressing me with the peril of mesmeric experiments there were great difficulties in the way of this theory sawyer would never have betrayed me nor had i any friends at all likely to undertake such an enterprise nevertheless the supposition that i was the victim of a practical joke seemed on the whole the only one tenable half expecting to catch a glimpse of some familiar face grinning from behind a chair or curtain i looked carefully about the room when my eyes next rested on my companion he was looking at me you have had a fine nap of twelve hours he said briskly and i can see that it has done you good you look much better your color is good and your eyes are bright how do you feel i never felt better i said sitting up you remember your first waking no doubt he pursued and your surprise when i told you how long you had been asleep you said i believe that i had slept one hundred and thirteen years exactly you will admit i said with an ironical smile that the story was rather an improbable one extraordinary i admit he responded but given the proper conditions not improbable nor inconsistent with what we know of the trance state when complete as in your case the vital functions are absolutely suspended and there is no waste of the tissues no limit can be set to the possible duration of a trance when the external conditions protect the body from physical injury this trance of yours is indeed the longest of which there is any positive record but there is no known reason wherefore had you not been discovered and had the chamber in which we found you continued intact you might not have remained in a state of suspended animation till at the end of indefinite ages the gradual refrigeration of the earth had destroyed the bodily tissues and set the spirit free i had to admit that if i were indeed the victim of a practical joke its authors had chosen an admirable agent for carrying out their imposition the impressive and even eloquent manner of this man would have lent dignity to an argument that the moon was made of cheese the smile with which i had regarded him as he advanced his trance hypothesis did not appear to confuse him in the slightest degree perhaps i said you will go on and favor me with some particulars as to the circumstances under which you discovered this chamber of which you speak and its contents i enjoy good fiction in this case was the grave reply no fiction could be so strange as the truth you must know that these many years i have been cherishing the idea of building a laboratory in the large garden beside this house for the purpose of chemical experiments for which i have a taste last thursday the excavation for the cellar was at last begun it was completed by that night and friday the masons were to have come thursday night we had a tremendous deluge of rain and friday morning i found my cellar a frog pond and the walls quite washed down my daughter who had come out to view the disaster with me called my attention to a corner of masonry laid bare by the crumbling away of one of the walls i cleared a little earth from it and finding that it seemed part of a large mass determined to investigate it the workmen i sent for unearthed an oblong vault some eight feet below the surface and set in the corner of what had evidently been the foundation walls of an ancient house a layer of ashes and charcoal on the top of the vault showed that the house above had perished by fire the vault itself was perfectly intact the cement being as good as when first applied it had a door but this we could not force and found entrance by removing one of the flagstones which formed the roof the air which came up was stagnant but pure dry and not cold descending with a lantern i found myself in an apartment fitted up as a bedroom in the style of the nineteenth century on the bed lay a young man that he was dead and must have been dead a century was of course to be taken for granted but the extraordinary state of preservation of the body struck me and the medical colleagues whom i had summoned with amazement that the art of such embalming as this had ever been known we should not have believed yet here seemed conclusive testimony that our immediate ancestors had possessed it my medical colleagues whose curiosity was highly excited were at once for undertaking experiments to test the nature of the process employed but i withheld them my motive in so doing at least the only motive i now need speak of was the recollection of something i once had read about the extent to which your contemporaries had cultivated the subject of animal magnetism it had occurred to me as just conceivable that you might be in a trance and that the secret of your bodily integrity after so long a time was not the craft of an embalmer but life so extremely fanciful did this idea seem even to me that i did not risk the ridicule of my fellow physicians by mentioning it but gave some other reason for postponing their experiments no sooner however had they left me than i set on foot a systematic attempt at resuscitation of which you know the result had its theme been yet more incredible the circumstantiality of this narrative as well as the impressive manner and personality of the narrator might have staggered a listener and i had begun to feel very strangely when as he closed i chanced to catch a glimpse of my reflection in a mirror hanging on the wall of the room i rose and went up to it the face i saw was the face to a hair and a line and not a day older than the one i had looked at as i tied my cravat before going to edith that decoration day which as this man would have me believe was celebrated one hundred and thirteen years before at this the colossal character of the fraud which was being attempted on me came over me afresh indignation mastered my mind as i realized the outrageous liberty that had been taken you are probably surprised said my companion to see that although you are a century older than when you lay down to sleep in that underground chamber your appearance is unchanged that should not amaze you it is by virtue of the total arrest of the vital functions that you have survived this great period of time if your body could have undergone any change during your trance it would long ago have suffered dissolution sir i replied turning to him what your motive can be in reciting to me with a serious face this remarkable farrago i am utterly unable to guess but you are surely yourself too intelligent to suppose that anybody but an imbecile could be deceived by it spare me any more of this elaborate nonsense and once for all tell me whether you refuse to give me an intelligible account of where i am and how i came here if so i shall proceed to ascertain my whereabouts for myself whoever may hinder you do not then believe that this is the year 2000 do you really think it necessary to ask me that i returned very well replied my extraordinary host since i cannot convince you you shall convince yourself are you strong enough to follow me upstairs i am as strong as i ever was i replied angrily as i may have to prove if this jest is carried much farther i beg sir was my companion's response that you will not allow yourself to be too fully persuaded that you are the victim of a trick lest the reaction when you are convinced of the truth of my statements should be too great the tone of concern mingled with commiseration with which he said this and the entire absence of any sign of resentment at my hot words strangely daunted me and i followed him from the room with an extraordinary mixture of emotions he led the way up two flights of stairs and then up a shorter one which landed us upon a belvedere on the house top be pleased to look around you he said as we reached the platform and tell me if this is the boston of the nineteenth century at my feet lay a great city miles of broad streets shaded by trees and lined with fine buildings for the most part not in continuous blocks but set in larger or smaller inclosures stretched in every direction every quarter contained large open squares filled with trees among which statues glistened and fountains flashed in the late afternoon sun public buildings of a colossal size and an architectural grandeur unparalleled in my day raised their stately piles on every side surely i had never seen this city nor one comparable to it before raising my eyes at last towards the horizon i looked westward that blue ribbon winding away to the sunset was it not the sinuous charles i looked east boston harbor stretched before me within its headlands not one of its green islets missing i knew then that i had been told the truth concerning the prodigious thing which had befallen me chapter 4 i did not faint but the effort to realize my position made me very giddy and i remember that my companion had to give me a strong arm as he conducted me from the roof to a roomy apartment on the upper floor of the house where he insisted on my drinking a glass or two of good wine and partaking of a light repast i think you are going to be all right now he said cheerily i should not have taken so abrupt a means to convince you of your position if your course while perfectly excusable under the circumstances had not rather obliged me to do so i confess he added laughing i was a little apprehensive at one time that i should undergo what i believe you used to call a knockdown in the nineteenth century if i did not act rather promptly i remembered that the bostonians of your day were famous pugilists and thought best to lose no time i take it you are now ready to acquit me of the charge of hoaxing you if you had told me i replied profoundly awed that a thousand years instead of a hundred had elapsed since i last looked on this city i should now believe you only a century has passed he answered but many a millennium in the world's history has seen changes less extraordinary and now he added extending his hand with an air of irresistible cordiality let me give you a hearty welcome to the boston of the twentieth century and to this house my name is leete dr leete they call me my name i said as i shook his hand is julian west i am most happy in making your acquaintance mr west he responded seeing that this house is built on the site of your own i hope you will find it easy to make yourself at home in it after my refreshment dr leete offered me a bath and a change of clothing of which i gladly availed myself it did not appear that any very startling revolution in men's attire had been among the great changes my host had spoken of for barring a few details my new habiliments did not puzzle me at all physically i was now myself again but mentally how was it with me the reader will doubtless wonder what were my intellectual sensations he may wish to know on finding myself so suddenly dropped as it were into a new world in reply let me ask him to suppose himself suddenly in the twinkling of an eye transported from earth say to paradise or hades what does he fancy would be his own experience would his thoughts return at once to the earth he had just left or would he after the first shock wellnigh forget his former life for a while albeit to be remembered later in the interest excited by his new surroundings all i can say is that if his experience were at all like mine in the transition i am describing the latter hypothesis would prove the correct one the impressions of amazement and curiosity which my new surroundings produced occupied my mind after the first shock to the exclusion of all other thoughts for the time the memory of my former life was as it were in abeyance no sooner did i find myself physically rehabilitated through the kind offices of my host than i became eager to return to the house top and presently we were comfortably established there in easy chairs with the city beneath and around us after dr leete had responded to numerous questions on my part as to the ancient landmarks i missed and the new ones which had replaced them he asked me what point of the contrast between the new and the old city struck me most forcibly to speak of small things before great i responded i really think that the complete absence of chimneys and their smoke is the detail that first impressed me ah ejaculated my companion with an air of much interest i had forgotten the chimneys it is so long since they went out of use it is nearly a century since the crude method of combustion on which you depended for heat became obsolete in general i said what impresses me most about the city is the material prosperity on the part of the people which its magnificence implies i would give a great deal for just one glimpse of the boston of your day replied dr leete no doubt as you imply the cities of that period were rather shabby affairs if you had the taste to make them splendid which i would not be so rude as to question the general poverty resulting from your extraordinary industrial system would not have given you the means moreover the excessive individualism which then prevailed was inconsistent with much public spirit what little wealth you had seems almost wholly to have been lavished in private luxury nowadays on the contrary there is no destination of the surplus wealth so popular as the adornment of the city which all enjoy in equal degree the sun had been setting as we returned to the house top and as we talked night descended upon the city it is growing dark said dr leete let us descend into the house i want to introduce my wife and daughter to you his words recalled to me the feminine voices which i had heard whispering about me as i was coming back to conscious life and most curious to learn what the ladies of the year 2000 were like i assented with alacrity to the proposition the apartment in which we found the wife and daughter of my host as well as the entire interior of the house was filled with a mellow light which i knew must be artificial although i could not discover the source from which it was diffused mrs leete was an exceptionally fine looking and well preserved woman of about her husband's age while the daughter who was in the first blush of womanhood was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen her face was as bewitching as deep blue eyes delicately tinted complexion and perfect features could make it but even had her countenance lacked special charms the faultless luxuriance of her figure would have given her place as a beauty among the women of the nineteenth century feminine softness and delicacy were in this lovely creature deliciously combined with an appearance of health and abounding physical vitality too often lacking in the maidens with whom alone i could compare her it was a coincidence trifling in comparison with the general strangeness of the situation but still striking that her name should be edith the evening that followed was certainly unique in the history of social intercourse but to suppose that our conversation was peculiarly strained or difficult would be a great mistake i believe indeed that it is under what may be called unnatural in the sense of extraordinary circumstances that people behave most naturally for the reason no doubt that such circumstances banish artificiality i know at any rate that my intercourse that evening with these representatives of another age and world was marked by an ingenuous sincerity and frankness such as but rarely crown long acquaintance no doubt the exquisite tact of my entertainers had much to do with this of course there was nothing we could talk of but the strange experience by virtue of which i was there but they talked of it with an interest so naive and direct in its expression as to relieve the subject to a great degree of the element of the weird and the uncanny which might so easily have been overpowering one would have supposed that they were quite in the habit of entertaining waifs from another century so perfect was their tact for my own part never do i remember the operations of my mind to have been more alert and acute than that evening or my intellectual sensibilities more keen of course i do not mean that the consciousness of my amazing situation was for a moment out of mind but its chief effect thus far was to produce a feverish elation a sort of mental intoxication 1 edith leete took little part in the conversation but when several times the magnetism of her beauty drew my glance to her face i found her eyes fixed on me with an absorbed intensity almost like fascination it was evident that i had excited her interest to an extraordinary degree as was not astonishing supposing her to be a girl of imagination though i supposed curiosity was the chief motive of her interest it could but affect me as it would not have done had she been less beautiful dr leete as well as the ladies seemed greatly interested in my account of the circumstances under which i had gone to sleep in the underground chamber all had suggestions to offer to account for my having been forgotten there and the theory which we finally agreed on offers at least a plausible explanation although whether it be in its details the true one nobody of course will ever know the layer of ashes found above the chamber indicated that the house had been burned down let it be supposed that the conflagration had taken place the night i fell asleep it only remains to assume that sawyer lost his life in the fire or by some accident connected with it and the rest follows naturally enough no one but he and dr pillsbury either knew of the existence of the chamber or that i was in it and dr pillsbury who had gone that night to new orleans had probably never heard of the fire at all the conclusion of my friends and of the public must have been that i had perished in the flames an excavation of the ruins unless thorough would not have disclosed the recess in the foundation walls connecting with my chamber to be sure if the site had been again built upon at least immediately such an excavation would have been necessary but the troublous times and the undesirable character of the locality might well have prevented rebuilding the size of the trees in the garden now occupying the site indicated dr leete said that for more than half a century at least it had been open ground 1 in accounting for this state of mind it must be remembered that except for the topic of our conversations there was in my surroundings next to nothing to suggest what had befallen me within a block of my home in the old boston i could have found social circles vastly more foreign to me the speech of the bostonians of the twentieth century differs even less from that of their cultured ancestors of the nineteenth than did that of the latter from the language of washington and franklin while the differences between the style of dress and furniture of the two epochs are not more marked than i have known fashion to make in the time of one generation chapter 5 when in the course"
