the long hours dragged and the storm increased in fury cameron and warren wet scarfs with water from their canteens and bound them round their faces and then covered their heads the steady hollow bellow of flying sand went on it flew so thickly that enough sifted down under the shelving rock to weight the blankets and almost bury the men they were frequently compelled to shake off the sand to keep from being borne to the ground and it was necessary to keep digging out the packs the floor of their shelter gradually rose higher and higher they tried to eat and seemed to be grinding only sand between their teeth they lost the count of time they dared not sleep for that would have meant being buried alive the could only crouch close to the leaning rock shake off the sand blindly dig out their packs and every moment gasp and cough and choke to fight suffocation the storm finally blew itself out it left the prospectors heavy and stupid for want of sleep their burros had wandered away or had been buried in the sand far as eye could reach the desert had marvelously changed it was now a rippling sea of sand dunes away to the north rose the peak that was their only guiding mark they headed toward it carrying a shovel and part of their packs at noon the peak vanished in the shimmering glare of the desert the prospectors pushed on guided by the sun in every wash they tried for water with the forked peach branch in his hands warren always succeeded in locating water they dug but it lay too deep at length spent and sore they fell and slept through that night and part of the next day then they succeeded in getting water and quenched their thirst and filled the canteens and cooked a meal the burning day found them in an interminably wide plain where there was no shelter from the fierce sun the men were exceedingly careful with their water though there was absolute necessity of drinking a little every hour late in the afternoon they came to a canyon that they believed was the lower end of the one in which they had last found water for hours they traveled toward its head and long after night had set found what they sought yielding to exhaustion they slept and next day were loath to leave the waterhole cool night spurred them on with canteens full and renewed strength morning told cameron that they had turned back miles into the desert and it was desert new to him the red sun the increasing heat and especially the variety and large size of the cactus plants warned cameron that he had descended to a lower level mountain peaks loomed on all sides some near others distant and one a blue spur splitting the glaring sky far to the north cameron thought he recognized as a landmark the ascent toward it was heartbreaking not in steepness but in its league and league long monotonous rise cameron knew there was only one hope to make the water hold out and never stop to rest warren began to weaken often he had to halt the burning white day passed and likewise the night with its white stars shining so pitilessly cold and bright cameron measured the water in his canteen by its weight evaporation by heat consumed as much as he drank during one of the rests when he had wetted his parched mouth and throat he found opportunity to pour a little water from his canteen into warren's at first cameron had curbed his restless activity to accommodate the pace of his elder comrade but now he felt that he was losing something of his instinctive and passionate zeal to get out of the desert the thought of water came to occupy his mind he began to imagine that his last little store of water did not appreciably diminish he knew he was not quite right in his mind regarding water nevertheless he felt this to be more of fact than fancy and he began to ponder when next they rested he pretended to be in a kind of stupor but he covertly watched warren the man appeared far gone yet he had cunning he cautiously took up cameron's canteen and poured water into it from his own this troubled cameron the old irritation at not being able to thwart warren returned to him cameron reflected and concluded that he had been unwise not to expect this very thing then as his comrade dropped into weary rest he lifted both canteens if there were any water in warren's it was only very little both men had been enduring the terrible desert thirst concealing it each giving his water to the other and the sacrifice had been useless instead of ministering to the parched throats of one or both the water had evaporated when cameron made sure of this he took one more drink the last and poured the little water left into warren's canteen he threw his own away soon afterward warren discovered the loss where's your canteen he asked the heat was getting my water so i drank what was left my son said warren the day opened for them in a red and green hell of rock and cactus like a flame the sun scorched and peeled their faces warren went blind from the glare and cameron had to lead him at last warren plunged down exhausted in the shade of a ledge cameron rested and waited hopeless with hot weary eyes gazing down from the height where he sat the ledge was the top step of a ragged gigantic stairway below stretched a sad austere and lonely valley a dim wide streak lighter than the bordering gray wound down the valley floor once a river had flowed there leaving only a forlorn trace down the winding floor of this forlorn valley movement on the part of warren attracted cameron's attention evidently the old prospector had recovered his sight and some of his strength for he had arisen and now began to walk along the arroyo bed with his forked peach branch held before him he had clung to the precious bit of wood cameron considered the prospect for water hopeless because he saw that the arroyo had once been a canyon and had been filled with sands by desert winds warren however stopped in a deep pit and cutting his canteen in half began to use one side of it as a scoop he scooped out a wide hollow so wide that cameron was certain he had gone crazy cameron gently urged him to stop and then forcibly tried to make him but these efforts were futile warren worked with slow ceaseless methodical movement he toiled for what seemed hours cameron seeing the darkening dampening sand realized a wonderful possibility of water and he plunged into the pit with the other half of the canteen then both men toiled round and round the wide hole down deeper and deeper the sand grew moist then wet at the bottom of the deep pit the sand coarsened gave place to gravel finally water welled in a stronger volume than cameron ever remembered finding on the desert it would soon fill the hole and run over he marveled at the circumstance the time was near the end of the dry season perhaps an underground stream flowed from the range behind down to the valley floor and at this point came near to the surface cameron had heard of such desert miracles the finding of water revived cameron's flagging hopes but they were short lived warren had spend himself utterly i'm done don't linger he whispered my son go go then he fell cameron dragged him out of the sand pit to a sheltered place under the ledge while sitting beside the failing man cameron discovered painted images on the wall often in the desert he had found these evidences of a prehistoric people then from long habit he picked up a piece of rock and examined it its weight made him closely scrutinize it the color was a peculiar black he scraped through the black rust to find a piece of gold around him lay scattered heaps of black pebbles and bits of black weathered rock and pieces of broken ledge and they showed gold warren look see it feel it gold but warren had never cared and now he was too blind to see go go he whispered cameron gazed down the gray reaches of the forlorn valley and something within him that was neither intelligence nor emotion something inscrutably strange impelled him to promise then cameron built up stone monuments to mark his gold strike that done he tarried beside the unconscious warren moments passed grew into hours cameron still had strength left to make an effort to get out of the desert but that same inscrutable something which had ordered his strange involuntary promise to warren held him beside his fallen comrade he watched the white sun turn to gold and then to red and sink behind mountains in the west twilight stole into the arroyo it lingered slowly turning to gloom the vault of blue black lightened to the blinking of stars then fell the serene silent luminous desert night cameron kept his vigil as the long hours wore on he felt creep over him the comforting sense that he need not forever fight sleep a wan glow flared behind the dark uneven horizon and a melancholy misshapen moon rose to make the white night one of shadows absolute silence claimed the desert it was mute then that inscrutable something breathed to him telling him when he was alone he need not have looked at the dark still face beside him another face haunted cameron's a woman's face it was there in the white moonlit shadows it drifted in the darkness beyond it softened changed to that of a young girl sweet with the same dark haunting eyes of her mother cameron prayed to that nameless thing within him the spirit of something deep and mystical as life he prayed to that nameless thing outside of which the rocks and the sand the spiked cactus and the ragged lava the endless waste with its vast star fired mantle were but atoms he prayed for mercy to a woman for happiness to her child both mother and daughter were close to him then time and distance were annihilated he had faith he saw into the future the fateful threads of the past so inextricably woven with his error wound out their tragic length here in this forlorn desert cameron then took a little tin box from his pocket and opening it removed a folded certificate he had kept a pen and now he wrote something upon the paper and in lieu of ink he wrote with blood the moon afforded him enough light to see and having replaced the paper he laid the little box upon a shelf of rock it would remain there unaffected by dust moisture heat time how long had those painted images been there clear and sharp on the dry stone walls there were no trails in that desert and always there were incalculable changes cameron saw this mutable mood of nature the sands would fly and seep and carve and bury the floods would dig and cut the ledges would weather in the heat and rain the avalanches would slide the cactus seeds would roll in the wind to catch in a niche and split the soil with thirsty roots years would pass cameron seemed to see them too and likewise destiny leading a child down into this forlorn waste where she would find love and fortune and the grave of her father cameron covered the dark still face of his comrade from the light of the waning moon that action was the severing of his hold on realities they fell away from him in final separation vaguely dreamily he seemed to behold his soul night merged into gray day and night came again weird and dark then up out of the vast void of the desert from the silence and illimitableness trooped his phantoms of peace majestically they formed around him marshalling and mustering in ceremonious state and moved to lay upon him their passionless serenity i old friends richard gale reflected that his sojourn in the west had been what his disgusted father had predicted idling here and there with no objective point or purpose it was reflection such as this only more serious and perhaps somewhat desperate that had brought gale down to the border for some time the newspapers had been printing news of mexican revolution guerrilla warfare united states cavalry patrolling the international line american cowboys fighting with the rebels and wild stories of bold raiders and bandits but as opportunity and adventure too had apparently given him a wide berth in montana wyoming colorado he had struck southwest for the arizona border where he hoped to see some stirring life he did not care very much what happened months of futile wandering in the hope of finding a place where he fitted had inclined richard to his father's opinion it was after dark one evening in early october when richard arrived in casita he was surprised to find that it was evidently a town of importance there was a jostling jabbering sombreroed crowd of mexicans around the railroad station he felt as if he were in a foreign country after a while he saw several men of his nationality one of whom he engaged to carry his luggage to a hotel they walked up a wide well lighted street lined with buildings in which were bright windows of the many people encountered by gale most were mexicans his guide explained that the smaller half of casita lay in arizona the other half in mexico and of several thousand inhabitants the majority belonged on the southern side of the street which was the boundary line he also said that rebels had entered the town that day causing a good deal of excitement gale was almost at the end of his financial resources which fact occasioned him to turn away from a pretentious hotel and to ask his guide for a cheaper lodging house when this was found a sight of the loungers in the office and also a desire for comfort persuaded gale to change his traveling clothes for rough outing garb and boots well i'm almost broke he soliloquized thoughtfully the governor said i wouldn't make any money he's right so far and he said i'd be coming home beaten there he's wrong i've got a hunch that something ll happen to me in this greaser town he went out into a wide whitewashed high ceiled corridor and from that into an immense room which but for pool tables bar benches would have been like a courtyard the floor was cobblestoned the walls were of adobe and the large windows opened like doors a blue cloud of smoke filled the place gale heard the click of pool balls and the clink of glasses along the crowded bar bare legged sandal footed mexicans in white rubbed shoulders with mexicans mantled in black and red there were others in tight fitting blue uniforms with gold fringe or tassels at the shoulders these men wore belts with heavy bone handled guns and evidently were the rurales or native policemen there were black bearded coarse visaged americans some gambling round the little tables others drinking the pool tables were the center of a noisy crowd of younger men several of whom were unsteady on their feet there were khaki clad cavalrymen strutting in and out at one end of the room somewhat apart from the general meelee was a group of six men round a little table four of whom were seated the other two standing these last two drew a second glance from gale the sharp featured bronzed faces and piercing eyes the tall slender loosely jointed bodies the quiet easy reckless air that seemed to be a part of the men these things would plainly have stamped them as cowboys without the buckled sombreros the colored scarfs the high topped high heeled boots with great silver roweled spurs gale did not fail to note also that these cowboys wore guns and this fact was rather a shock to his idea of the modern west it caused him to give some credence to the rumors of fighting along the border and he felt a thrill he satisfied his hunger in a restaurant adjoining and as he stepped back into the saloon a man wearing a military cape jostled him apologies from both were instant gale was moving on when the other stopped short as if startled and leaning forward exclaimed dick gale you've got me replied gale in surprise but i don't know you he could not see the stranger's face because it was wholly shaded by a wide brimmed hat pulled well down by jove it's dick if this isn't great don't you know me i've heard your voice somewhere replied gale maybe i'll recognize you if you come out from under that bonnet for answer the man suddenly manifesting thought of himself hurriedly drew gale into the restaurant where he thrust back his hat to disclose a handsome sunburned face george thorne so help me s s ssh you needn't yell interrupted the other as he met gale's outstretched hand there was a close hard straining grip i must not be recognized here there are reasons i'll explain in a minute say but it's fine to see you five years dick five years since i saw you run down university field and spread eagle the whole wisconsin football team don't recollect that replied dick laughing george i'll bet you i'm gladder to see you than you are to see me it seems so long you went into the army didn't you i did i'm here now with the ninth cavalry but never mind me what're you doing way down here say i just noticed your togs dick you can't be going in for mining or ranching not in this god forsaken desert on the square george i don't know any more why i'm here than than you know well that beats me ejaculated thorne sitting back in his chair amaze and concern in his expression what the devil's wrong your old man's got too much money for you ever to be up against it dick you couldn't have gone to the bad a tide of emotion surged over gale how good it was to meet a friend some one to whom to talk he had never appreciated his loneliness until that moment george how i ever drifted down here i don't know i didn't exactly quarrel with the governor but damn it dad hurt me shamed me and i dug out for the west it was this way after leaving college i tried to please him by tackling one thing after another that he set me to do on the square i had no head for business i made a mess of everything the governor got sore he kept ramming the harpoon into me till i just couldn't stand it what little ability i possessed deserted me when i got my back up and there you are dad and i had a rather uncomfortable half hour when i quit when i told him straight out that i was going west to fare for myself why it wouldn't have been so tough if he hadn't laughed at me he called me a rich man's son an idle easy going spineless swell he said i didn't even have character enough to be out and out bad he said i didn't have sense enough to marry one of the nice girls in my sister's crowd he said i couldn't get back home unless i sent to him for money he said he didn't believe i could fight could really make a fight for anything under the sun oh he he shot it into me all right dick dropped his head upon his hands somewhat ashamed of the smarting dimness in his eyes he had not meant to say so much yet what a relief to let out that long congested burden fight cried thorne hotly what's ailing him didn't they call you biff gale in college dick you were one of the best men stagg ever developed i heard him say so that you were the fastest one hundred and seventy five pound man he'd ever trained the hardest to stop the governor didn't count football said dick he didn't mean that kind of fight when i left home i don't think i had an idea what was wrong with me but george i think i know now i was a rich man's son spoiled dependent absolutely ignorant of the value of money i haven't yet discovered any earning capacity in me i seem to be unable to do anything with my hands that's the trouble but i'm at the end of my tether now and i'm going to punch cattle or be a miner or do some real stunt like joining the rebels aha i thought you'd spring that last one on me declared thorne wagging his head well you just forget it say old boy there's something doing in mexico the united states in general doesn't realize it but across that line there are crazy revolutionists ill paid soldiers guerrilla leaders raiders robbers outlaws bandits galore starving peons by the thousand girls and women in terror mexico is like some of her volcanoes ready to erupt fire and hell don't make the awful mistake of joining rebel forces americans are hated by mexicans of the lower class the fighting class both rebel and federal half the time these crazy greasers are on one side then on the other if you didn't starve or get shot in ambush or die of thirst some greaser would knife you in the back for you belt buckle or boots there are a good many americans with the rebels eastward toward agua prieta and juarez orozco is operating in chihuahua and i guess he has some idea of warfare but this is sonora a mountainous desert the home of the slave and the yaqui there's unorganized revolt everywhere the american miners and ranchers those who could get away have fled across into the states leaving property those who couldn't or wouldn't come must fight for their lives are fighting now that's bad said gale it's news to me why doesn't the government take action do something afraid of international complications don't want to offend the maderists or be criticized by jealous foreign nations it's a delicate situation dick the washington officials know the gravity of it you can bet but the united states in general is in the dark and the army well you ought to hear the inside talk back at san antonio we're patrolling the boundary line we're making a grand bluff i could tell you of a dozen instances where cavalry should have pursued raiders on the other side of the line but we won't do it the officers are a grouchy lot these days you see of course what significance would attach to united states cavalry going into mexican territory there would simply be hell my own colonel is the sorest man on the job we're all sore it's like sitting on a powder magazine we can't keep the rebels and raiders from crossing the line yet we don't fight my commission expires soon i'll be discharged in three months you can bet i'm glad for more reasons than i've mentioned thorne was evidently laboring under strong suppressed excitement his face showed pale under the tan and his eyes gleamed with a dark fire occasionally his delight at meeting talking with gale dominated the other emotions but not for long he had seated himself at a table near one of the doorlike windows leading into the street and every little while he would glance sharply out also he kept consulting his watch these details gradually grew upon gale as thorne talked george it strikes me that you're upset said dick presently i seem to remember you as a cool headed fellow whom nothing could disturb has the army changed you thorne laughed it was a laugh with a strange high note it was reckless it hinted of exaltation he rose abruptly he gave the waiter money to go for drinks he looked into the saloon and then into the street on this side of the house there was a porch opening on a plaza with trees and shrubbery and branches thorne peered out one window then another his actions were rapid returning to the table he put his hands upon it and leaned over to look closely into gale's face i'm away from camp without leave he said isn't that a serious offense asked dick serious for me if i'm discovered it means ruin there are rebels in town any moment we might have trouble i ought to be ready for duty within call if i'm discovered it means arrest that means delay the failure of my plans ruin gale was silenced by his friend's intensity thorne bent over closer with his dark eyes searching bright we were old pals once surely replied dick what would you say dick gale if i told you that you're the one man i'd rather have had come along than any other at this crisis of my life the earnest gaze the passionate voice with its deep tremor drew dick upright thrilling and eager conscious of strange unfamiliar impetuosity thorne i should say i was glad to be the fellow replied dick their hands locked for a moment and they sat down again with heads close over the table listen began thorne in low swift whisper a few days a week ago it seems like a year i was of some assistance to refugees fleeing from mexico into the states they were all women and one of them was dressed as a nun quite by accident i saw her face it was that of a beautiful girl i observed she kept aloof from the others i suspected a disguise and when opportunity afforded spoke to her offered my services she replied to my poor efforts at spanish in fluent english she had fled in terror from her home some place down in sinaloa rebels are active there her father was captured and held for ransom when the ransom was paid the rebels killed him the leader of these rebels was a bandit named rojas long before the revolution began he had been feared by people of class loved by the peons bandits are worshiped by the peons all of the famous bandits have robbed the rich and given to the poor rojas saw the daughter made off with her but she contrived to bribe her guards and escaped almost immediately before any harm befell her she hid among friends rojas nearly tore down the town in his efforts to find her then she disguised herself and traveled by horseback stage and train to casita her story fascinated me and that one fleeting glimpse i had of her face i couldn't forget she had no friends here no money she knew rojas was trailing her this talk i had with her was at the railroad station where all was bustle and confusion no one noticed us so i thought i advised her to remove the disguise of a nun before she left the waiting room and i got a boy to guide her but he fetched her to his house i had promised to come in the evening to talk over the situation with her i found her dick and when i saw her i went stark staring raving mad over her she is the most beautiful wonderful girl i ever saw her name is mercedes castaneda and she belongs to one of the old wealthy spanish families she has lived abroad and in havana she speaks french as well as english she is but i must be brief dick think think with mercedes also it was love at first sight my plan is to marry her and get her farther to the interior away from the border it may not be easy she's watched so am i it was impossible to see her without the women of this house knowing at first perhaps they had only curiosity an itch to gossip but the last two days there has been a change since last night there's some powerful influence at work oh these mexicans are subtle mysterious after all they are spaniards they work in secret in the dark they are dominated first by religion then by gold then by passion for a woman rojas must have got word to his friends here yesterday his gang of cutthroat rebels arrived and to day he came when i learned that i took my chance and left camp i hunted up a priest he promised to come here it's time he's due but i'm afraid he'll be stopped thorne why don't you take the girl and get married without waiting without running these risks said dick i fear it's too late now i should have done that last night you see we're over the line are we in mexican territory now queried gale sharply"
