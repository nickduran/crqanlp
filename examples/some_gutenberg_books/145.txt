"1" "casaubon was the most interesting man she had ever seen not excepting even monsieur liret the vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the waldenses to reconstruct a past world doubtless with a view to the highest purposes of truth what a work to be in any way present at to assist in though only as a lamp holder this elevating thought lifted her above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of political economy that never explained science which was thrust as an extinguisher over all her lights but you are fond of riding miss brooke sir james presently took an opportunity of saying i should have thought you would enter a little into the pleasures of hunting i wish you would let me send over a chestnut horse for you to try it has been trained for a lady i saw you on saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you my groom shall bring corydon for you every day if you will only mention the time thank you you are very good i mean to give up riding i shall not ride any more said dorothea urged to this brusque resolution by a little annoyance that sir james would be soliciting her attention when she wanted to give it all to mr casaubon no that is too hard said sir james in a tone of reproach that showed strong interest your sister is given to self mortification is she not he continued turning to celia who sat at his right hand i think she is said celia feeling afraid lest she should say something that would not please her sister and blushing as prettily as possible above her necklace she likes giving up if that were true celia my giving up would be self indulgence not self mortification but there may be good reasons for choosing not to do what is very agreeable said dorothea mr brooke was speaking at the same time but it was evident that mr casaubon was observing dorothea and she was aware of it exactly said sir james you give up from some high generous motive no indeed not exactly i did not say that of myself answered dorothea reddening unlike celia she rarely blushed and only from high delight or anger at this moment she felt angry with the perverse sir james why did he not pay attention to celia and leave her to listen to mr casaubon if that learned man would only talk instead of allowing himself to be talked to by mr brooke who was just then informing him that the reformation either meant something or it did not that he himself was a protestant to the core but that catholicism was a fact and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a romanist chapel all men needed the bridle of religion which properly speaking was the dread of a hereafter i made a great study of theology at one time said mr brooke as if to explain the insight just manifested i know something of all schools i knew wilberforce in his best days do you know wilberforce mr casaubon said no well wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker but if i went into parliament as i have been asked to do i should sit on the independent bench as wilberforce did and work at philanthropy mr casaubon bowed and observed that it was a wide field yes said mr brooke with an easy smile but i have documents i began a long while ago to collect documents they want arranging but when a question has struck me i have written to somebody and got an answer i have documents at my back but now how do you arrange your documents in pigeon holes partly said mr casaubon with rather a startled air of effort ah pigeon holes will not do i have tried pigeon holes but everything gets mixed in pigeon holes i never know whether a paper is in a or z i wish you would let me sort your papers for you uncle said dorothea i would letter them all and then make a list of subjects under each letter mr casaubon gravely smiled approval and said to mr brooke you have an excellent secretary at hand you perceive no no said mr brooke shaking his head i cannot let young ladies meddle with my documents young ladies are too flighty dorothea felt hurt mr casaubon would think that her uncle had some special reason for delivering this opinion whereas the remark lay in his mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other fragments there and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_ when the two girls were in the drawing room alone celia said how very ugly mr casaubon is celia he is one of the most distinguished looking men i ever saw he is remarkably like the portrait of locke he has the same deep eye sockets had locke those two white moles with hairs on them oh i dare say when people of a certain sort looked at him said dorothea walking away a little mr casaubon is so sallow all the better i suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a cochon de lait dodo exclaimed celia looking after her in surprise i never heard you make such a comparison before why should i make it before the occasion came it is a good comparison the match is perfect miss brooke was clearly forgetting herself and celia thought so i wonder you show temper dorothea it is so painful in you celia that you will look at human beings as if they were merely animals with a toilet and never see the great soul in a man's face has mr casaubon a great soul celia was not without a touch of naive malice yes i believe he has said dorothea with the full voice of decision everything i see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on biblical cosmology he talks very little said celia there is no one for him to talk to celia thought privately dorothea quite despises sir james chettam i believe she would not accept him celia felt that this was a pity she had never been deceived as to the object of the baronet's interest sometimes indeed she had reflected that dodo would perhaps not make a husband happy who had not her way of looking at things and stifled in the depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too religious for family comfort notions and scruples were like spilt needles making one afraid of treading or sitting down or even eating when miss brooke was at the tea table sir james came to sit down by her not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive why should he he thought it probable that miss brooke liked him and manners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted by preconceptions either confident or distrustful she was thoroughly charming to him but of course he theorized a little about his attachment he was made of excellent human dough and had the rare merit of knowing that his talents even if let loose would not set the smallest stream in the county on fire hence he liked the prospect of a wife to whom he could say what shall we do about this or that who could help her husband out with reasons and would also have the property qualification for doing so as to the excessive religiousness alleged against miss brooke he had a very indefinite notion of what it consisted in and thought that it would die out with marriage in short he felt himself to be in love in the right place and was ready to endure a great deal of predominance which after all a man could always put down when he liked sir james had no idea that he should ever like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl in whose cleverness he delighted why not a man's mind what there is of it has always the advantage of being masculine as the smallest birch tree is of a higher kind than the most soaring palm and even his ignorance is of a sounder quality sir james might not have originated this estimate but a kind providence furnishes the limpest personality with a little gum or starch in the form of tradition let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse miss brooke said the persevering admirer i assure you riding is the most healthy of exercises i am aware of it said dorothea coldly i think it would do celia good if she would take to it but you are such a perfect horsewoman excuse me i have had very little practice and i should be easily thrown then that is a reason for more practice every lady ought to be a perfect horsewoman that she may accompany her husband you see how widely we differ sir james i have made up my mind that i ought not to be a perfect horsewoman and so i should never correspond to your pattern of a lady dorothea looked straight before her and spoke with cold brusquerie very much with the air of a handsome boy in amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer i should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution it is not possible that you should think horsemanship wrong it is quite possible that i should think it wrong for me oh why said sir james in a tender tone of remonstrance mr casaubon had come up to the table teacup in hand and was listening we must not inquire too curiously into motives he interposed in his measured way miss brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in the utterance the aroma is mixed with the grosser air we must keep the germinating grain away from the light dorothea colored with pleasure and looked up gratefully to the speaker here was a man who could understand the higher inward life and with whom there could be some spiritual communion nay who could illuminate principle with the widest knowledge a man whose learning almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed dorothea's inferences may seem large but really life could never have gone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions which has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization has any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of pre matrimonial acquaintanceship certainly said good sir james miss brooke shall not be urged to tell reasons she would rather be silent upon i am sure her reasons would do her honor he was not in the least jealous of the interest with which dorothea had looked up at mr casaubon it never occurred to him that a girl to whom he was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm towards fifty except indeed in a religious sort of way as for a clergyman of some distinction however since miss brooke had become engaged in a conversation with mr casaubon about the vaudois clergy sir james betook himself to celia and talked to her about her sister spoke of a house in town and asked whether miss brooke disliked london away from her sister celia talked quite easily and sir james said to himself that the second miss brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty though not as some people pretended more clever and sensible than the elder sister he felt that he had chosen the one who was in all respects the superior and a man naturally likes to look forward to having the best he would be the very mawworm of bachelors who pretended not to expect it chapter iii say goddess what ensued when raphael the affable archangel eve the story heard attentive and was filled with admiration and deep muse to hear of things so high and strange paradise lost b vii if it had really occurred to mr casaubon to think of miss brooke as a suitable wife for him the reasons that might induce her to accept him were already planted in her mind and by the evening of the next day the reasons had budded and bloomed for they had had a long conversation in the morning while celia who did not like the company of mr casaubon's moles and sallowness had escaped to the vicarage to play with the curate's ill shod but merry children dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of mr casaubon's mind seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine extension every quality she herself brought had opened much of her own experience to him and had understood from him the scope of his great work also of attractively labyrinthine extent for he had been as instructive as milton's affable archangel and with something of the archangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show what indeed had been attempted before but not with that thoroughness justice of comparison and effectiveness of arrangement at which mr casaubon aimed that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally revealed having once mastered the true position and taken a firm footing there the vast field of mythical constructions became intelligible nay luminous with the reflected light of correspondences but to gather in this great harvest of truth was no light or speedy work his notes already made a formidable range of volumes but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous still accumulating results and bring them like the earlier vintage of hippocratic books to fit a little shelf in explaining this to dorothea mr casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done to a fellow student for he had not two styles of talking at command it is true that when he used a greek or latin phrase he always gave the english with scrupulous care but he would probably have done this in any case a learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his acquaintances as of lords knyghtes and other noble and worthi men that conne latyn but lytille dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this conception here was something beyond the shallows of ladies school literature here was a living bossuet whose work would reconcile complete knowledge with devoted piety here was a modern augustine who united the glories of doctor and saint the sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning for when dorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she could speak of to no one whom she had before seen at tipton especially on the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of belief compared with that spiritual religion that submergence of self in communion with divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed in the best christian books of widely distant ages she found in mr casaubon a listener who understood her at once who could assure her of his own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise conformity and could mention historical examples before unknown to her he thinks with me said dorothea to herself or rather he thinks a whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror and his feelings too his whole experience what a lake compared with my little pool miss brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly than other young ladies of her age signs are small measurable things but interpretations are illimitable and in girls of sweet ardent nature every sign is apt to conjure up wonder hope belief vast as a sky and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of knowledge they are not always too grossly deceived for sinbad himself may have fallen by good luck on a true description and wrong reasoning sometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions starting a long way off the true point and proceeding by loops and zigzags we now and then arrive just where we ought to be because miss brooke was hasty in her trust it is not therefore clear that mr casaubon was unworthy of it he stayed a little longer than he had intended on a slight pressure of invitation from mr brooke who offered no bait except his own documents on machine breaking and rick burning mr casaubon was called into the library to look at these in a heap while his host picked up first one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and uncertain way passing from one unfinished passage to another with a yes now but here and finally pushing them all aside to open the journal of his youthful continental travels look here here is all about greece rhamnus the ruins of rhamnus you are a great grecian now i don't know whether you have given much study to the topography i spent no end of time in making out these things helicon now here now we started the next morning for parnassus the double peaked parnassus all this volume is about greece you know mr brooke wound up rubbing his thumb transversely along the edges of the leaves as he held the book forward mr casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience bowed in the right place and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as possible without showing disregard or impatience mindful that this desultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country and that the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an amiable host but a landholder and custos rotulorum was his endurance aided also by the reflection that mr brooke was the uncle of dorothea certainly he seemed more and more bent on making her talk to him on drawing her out as celia remarked to herself and in looking at her his face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine before he left the next morning while taking a pleasant walk with miss brooke along the gravelled terrace he had mentioned to her that he felt the disadvantage of loneliness the need of that cheerful companionship with which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils of maturity and he delivered this statement with as much careful precision as if he had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be attended with results indeed mr casaubon was not used to expect that he should have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or personal kind the inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the 2d of october he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of that date judging by the standard of his own memory which was a volume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions and not the ordinary long used blotting book which only tells of forgotten writing but in this case mr casaubon's confidence was not likely to be falsified for dorothea heard and retained what he said with the eager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in experience is an epoch it was three o'clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when mr casaubon drove off to his rectory at lowick only five miles from tipton and dorothea who had on her bonnet and shawl hurried along the shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of monk the great st bernard dog who always took care of the young ladies in their walks there had risen before her the girl's vision of a possible future for herself to which she looked forward with trembling hope and she wanted to wander on in that visionary future without interruption she walked briskly in the brisk air the color rose in her cheeks and her straw bonnet which our contemporaries might look at with conjectural curiosity as at an obsolete form of basket fell a little backward she would perhaps be hardly characterized enough if it were omitted that she wore her brown hair flatly braided and coiled behind so as to expose the outline of her head in a daring manner at a time when public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be dissimulated by tall barricades of frizzed curls and bows never surpassed by any great race except the feejeean this was a trait of miss brooke's asceticism but there was nothing of an ascetic's expression in her bright full eyes as she looked before her not consciously seeing but absorbing into the intensity of her mood the solemn glory of the afternoon with its long swathes of light between the far off rows of limes whose shadows touched each other all people young or old that is all people in those ante reform times would have thought her an interesting object if they had referred the glow in her eyes and cheeks to the newly awakened ordinary images of young love the illusions of chloe about strephon have been sufficiently consecrated in poetry as the pathetic loveliness of all spontaneous trust ought to be miss pippin adoring young pumpkin and dreaming along endless vistas of unwearying companionship was a little drama which never tired our fathers and mothers and had been put into all costumes let but pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the disadvantages of the shortwaisted swallow tail and everybody felt it not only natural but necessary to the perfection of womanhood that a sweet girl should be at once convinced of his virtue his exceptional ability and above all his perfect sincerity but perhaps no persons then living certainly none in the neighborhood of tipton would have had a sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions about marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm about the ends of life an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own fire and included neither the niceties of the trousseau the pattern of plate nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron it had now entered dorothea's mind that mr casaubon might wish to make her his wife and the idea that he would do so touched her with a sort of reverential gratitude how good of him nay it would be almost as if a winged messenger had suddenly stood beside her path and held out his hand towards her for a long while she had been oppressed by the indefiniteness which hung in her mind like a thick summer haze over all her desire to make her life greatly effective what could she do what ought she to do she hardly more than a budding woman but yet with an active conscience and a great mental need not to be satisfied by a girlish instruction comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a discursive mouse with some endowment of stupidity and conceit she might have thought that a christian young lady of fortune should find her ideal of life in village charities patronage of the humbler clergy the perusal of female scripture characters unfolding the private experience of sara under the old dispensation and dorcas under the new and the care of her soul over her embroidery in her own boudoir with a background of prospective marriage to a man who if less strict than herself as being involved in affairs religiously inexplicable might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted from such contentment poor dorothea was shut out the intensity of her religious disposition the coercion it exercised over her life was but one aspect of a nature altogether ardent theoretic and intellectually consequent and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow teaching hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a labyrinth of petty courses a walled in maze of small paths that led no whither the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration and inconsistency the thing which seemed to her best she wanted to justify by the completest knowledge and not to live in a pretended admission of rules which were never acted on into this soul hunger as yet all her youthful passion was poured the union which attracted her was one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own ignorance and give her the freedom of voluntary submission to a guide who would take her along the grandest path i should learn everything then she said to herself still walking quickly along the bridle road through the wood it would be my duty to study that i might help him the better in his great works there would be nothing trivial about our lives every day things with us would mean the greatest things it would be like marrying pascal i should learn to see the truth by the same light as great men have seen it by and then i should know what to do when i got older i should see how it was possible to lead a grand life here now in england i don't feel sure about doing good in any way now everything seems like going on a mission to a people whose language i don't know unless it were building good cottages there can be no doubt about that oh i hope i should be able to get the people well housed in lowick i will draw plenty of plans while i have time dorothea checked herself suddenly with self rebuke for the presumptuous way in which she was reckoning on uncertain events but she was spared any inward effort to change the direction of her thoughts by the appearance of a cantering horseman round a turning of the road the well groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful setters could leave no doubt that the rider was sir james chettam he discerned dorothea jumped off his horse at once and having delivered it to his groom advanced towards her with something white on his arm at which the two setters were barking in an excited manner how delightful to meet you miss brooke he said raising his hat and showing his sleekly waving blond hair it has hastened the pleasure i was looking forward to miss brooke was annoyed at the interruption this amiable baronet really a suitable husband for celia exaggerated the necessity of making himself agreeable to the elder sister even a prospective brother in law may be an oppression if he will always be presupposing too good an understanding with you and agreeing with you even when you contradict him the thought that he had made the mistake of paying his addresses to herself could not take shape all her mental activity was used up in persuasions of another kind but he was positively obtrusive at this moment and his dimpled hands were quite disagreeable her roused temper made her color deeply as she returned his greeting with some haughtiness sir james interpreted the heightened color in the way most gratifying to himself and thought he never saw miss brooke looking so handsome i have brought a little petitioner he said or rather i have brought him to see if he will be approved before his petition is offered he showed the white object under his arm which was a tiny maltese puppy one of nature's most naive toys it is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely as pets said dorothea whose opinion was forming itself that very moment as opinions will under the heat of irritation oh why said sir james as they walked forward i believe all the petting that is given them does not make them happy they are too helpless their lives are too frail a weasel or a mouse that gets its own living is more interesting i like to think that the animals about us have souls something like our own and either carry on their own little affairs or can be companions to us like monk here those creatures are parasitic i am so glad i know that you do not like them said good sir james i should never keep them for myself but ladies usually are fond of these maltese dogs here john take this dog will you the objectionable puppy whose nose and eyes were equally black and expressive was thus got rid of since miss brooke decided that it had better not have been born but she felt it necessary to explain you must not judge of celia's feeling from mine i think she likes these small pets she had a tiny terrier once which she was very fond of it made me unhappy because i was afraid of treading on it i am rather short sighted you have your own opinion about everything miss brooke and it is always a good opinion what answer was possible to such stupid complimenting do you know i envy you that sir james said as they continued walking at the rather brisk pace set by dorothea i don't quite understand what you mean your power of forming an opinion i can form an opinion of persons i know when i like people but about other matters do you know i have often a difficulty in deciding one hears very sensible things said on opposite sides or that seem sensible perhaps we don't always discriminate between sense and nonsense dorothea felt that she was rather rude exactly said sir james but you seem to have the power of discrimination on the contrary i am often unable"
