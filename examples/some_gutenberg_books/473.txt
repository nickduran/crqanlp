"1" "and with much good reading aloud by the teacher they will go far toward setting a standard and developing good habit but their provinces must not be confused or overestimated i trust i may be pardoned for offering a caution or two to the enthusiastic advocate of these methods cautions the need of which has been forced upon me in experience with schools a teacher who uses the oral story as an english feature with little children must never lose sight of the fact that it is an aid in unconscious development not a factor in studied conscious improvement this truth cannot be too strongly realized other exercises in sufficiency give the opportunity for regulated effort for definite results but the story is one of the play forces its use in english teaching is most valuable when the teacher has a keen appreciation of the natural order of growth in the art of expression that art requires as the old rhetorics used often to put it a natural facility succeeded by an acquired difficulty in other words the power of expression depends first on something more fundamental than the art element the basis of it is something to say accompanied by an urgent desire to say it and yielded to with freedom only after this stage is reached can the art phase be of any use the why and how the analytical and constructive phases have no natural place in this first vital epoch precisely here however does the dramatizing of stories and the paper cutting etc become useful a fine and thoughtful principal of a great school asked me recently with real concern about the growing use of such devices he said paper cutting is good but what has it to do with english and then he added the children use abominable language when they play the stories can that directly aid them to speak good english his observation was close and correct and his conservatism more valuable than the enthusiasm of some of his colleagues who have advocated sweeping use of the supplementary work but his point of view ignored the basis of expression which is to my mind so important paper cutting is external to english of course its only connection is in its power to correlate different forms of expression and to react on speech expression through sense stimulus but playing the story is a closer relative to english than this it helps amazingly in giving the something to say the urgent desire to say it and the freedom in trying never mind the crudities at least at the time work only for joyous freedom inventiveness and natural forms of reproduction of the ideas given look for very gradual changes in speech through the permeating power of imitation but do not forget that this is the stage of expression which inevitably precedes art all this will mean that no corrections are made except in flagrant cases of slang or grammar though all bad slips are mentally noted for introduction at a more favorable time it will mean that the teacher will respect the continuity of thought and interest as completely as she would wish an audience to respect her occasional prosy periods if she were reading a report she will remember of course that she is not training actors for amateur theatricals however tempting her show material may be she is simply letting the children play with expression just as a gymnasium teacher introduces muscular play for power through relaxation when the time comes that the actors lose their unconsciousness it is the end of the story play drilled work the beginning of the art is then the necessity i have indicated that the children may be left undisturbed in their crudities and occasional absurdities the teacher on the other hand must avoid with great judgment certain absurdities which can easily be initiated by her the first direful possibility is in the choice of material it is very desirable that children should not be allowed to dramatize stories of a kind so poetic so delicate or so potentially valuable that the material is in danger of losing future beauty to the pupils through its present crude handling mother goose is a hardy old lady and will not suffer from the grasp of the seven year old and the familiar fables and tales of the goldilocks variety have a firmness of surface which does not let the glamour rub off but stories in which there is a hint of the beauty just beyond the palpable or of a dignity suggestive of developed literature are sorely hurt in their metamorphosis and should be protected from it they are for telling only another point on which it is necessary to exercise reserve is in the degree to which any story can be acted in the justifiable desire to bring a large number of children into the action one must not lose sight of the sanity and propriety of the presentation for example one must not make a ridiculous caricature where a picture however crude is the intention personally represent only such things as are definitely and dramatically personified in the story if a natural force the wind for example is represented as talking and acting like a human being in the story it can be imaged by a person in the play but if it remains a part of the picture in the story performing only its natural motions it is a caricature to enact it as a role the most powerful instance of a mistake of this kind which i have ever seen will doubtless make my meaning clear in playing a pretty story about animals and children some children in a primary school were made by the teacher to take the part of the sea in the story the sea was said to beat upon the shore as a sea would without doubt in the play the children were allowed to thump the floor lustily as a presentation of their watery functions it was unconscionably funny fancy presenting even the crudest image of the mighty sea surging up on the shore by a row of infants squatted on the floor and pounding with their fists such pitfalls can be avoided by the simple rule of personifying only characters that actually behave like human beings a caution which directly concerns the art of story telling itself must be added here there is a definite distinction between the arts of narration and dramatization which must never be overlooked do not yourself half tell and half act the story and do not let the children do it it is done in very good schools sometimes because an enthusiasm for realistic and lively presentation momentarily obscures the faculty of discrimination a much loved and respected teacher whom i recently listened to and who will laugh if she recognizes her blunder here offers a good bad example in this particular she said to an attentive audience of students that she had at last with much difficulty brought herself to the point where she could forget herself in her story where she could for instance hop like the fox when she told the story of the sour grapes she said it was hard at first but now it is a matter of course and the children do it too when they tell the story that was the pity i saw the illustration myself a little later the child who played fox began with a story he said once there was an old fox and he saw some grapes then the child walked to the other side of the room and looked up at an imaginary vine and said he wanted some he thought they would taste good so he jumped for them at this point the child did jump like his role then he continued with his story but he couldn't get them and so he proceeded with a constant alternation of narrative and dramatization which was enough to make one dizzy the trouble in such work is plainly a lack of discriminating analysis telling a story necessarily implies non identification of the teller with the event he relates what occurs or occurred outside of his circle of consciousness acting a play necessarily implies identification of the actor with the event he presents to you a picture of the thing in himself it is a difference wide and clear and the least failure to recognize it confuses the audience and injures both arts in the preceding instances of secondary uses of story telling i have come some distance from the great point the fundamental point of the power of imitation in breeding good habit this power is less noticeably active in the dramatizing than in simple re telling in the listening and the re telling it is dominant for good the child imitates what he hears you say and sees you do and the way you say and do it far more closely in the story hour than in any lesson period he is in a more absorbent state as it were because there is no preoccupation of effort here is the great opportunity of the cultured teacher here is the appalling opportunity of the careless or ignorant teacher for the implications of the oral theory of teaching english are evident concerning the immense importance of the teacher's habit this is what it all comes to ultimately the teacher of young children must be a person who can speak english as it should be spoken purely clearly pleasantly and with force it is a hard ideal to live up to but it is a valuable ideal to try to live up to and one of the best chances to work toward attainment is in telling stories for there you have definite material which you can work into shape and practice on in private that practice ought to include conscious thought as to one's general manner in the schoolroom and intelligent effort to understand and improve one's own voice i hope i shall not seem to assume the dignity of an authority which no personal taste can claim if i beg a hearing for the following elements of manner and voice which appeal to me as essential they will probably appear self evident to my readers yet they are often found wanting in the public school teacher it is so much easier to say what were good to do than to do it three elements of manner seem to me an essential adjunct to the personality of a teacher of little children courtesy repose vitality repose and vitality explain themselves by courtesy i specifically do not mean the habit of mind which contents itself with drilling children in good mornings and in hat liftings i mean the attitude of mind which recognizes in the youngest commonest child the potential dignity majesty and mystery of the developed human soul genuine reverence for the humanity of the other fellow marks a definite degree of courtesy in the intercourse of adults does it not and the same quality of respect tempered by the demands of a wise control is exactly what is needed among children again and again in dealing with young minds the teacher who respects personality as sacred no matter how embryonic it be wins the victories which count for true education yet all too often we forget the claims of this reverence in the presence of the annoyances and the needed corrections as for voice work in schoolrooms brings two opposing mistakes constantly before me one is the repressed voice and the other the forced the best way to avoid either extreme is to keep in mind that the ideal is development of one's own natural voice along its own natural lines a quiet gentle voice is conscientiously aimed at by many young teachers with so great zeal that the tone becomes painfully repressed breathy and timid this is quite as unpleasant as a loud voice which is in turn a frequent result of early admonitions to speak up neither is natural it is wise to determine the natural volume and pitch of one's speaking voice by a number of tests made when one is thoroughly rested at ease and alone find out where your voice lies when it is left to itself under favorable conditions by reading something aloud or by listening to yourself as you talk to an intimate friend then practise keeping it in that general range unless it prove to have a distinct fault such as a nervous sharpness or hoarseness a quiet voice is good a hushed voice is abnormal a clear tone is restful but a loud one is wearying perhaps the common sense way of setting a standard for one's own voice is to remember that the purpose of a speaking voice is to communicate with others their ears and minds are the receivers of our tones for this purpose evidently a voice should be first of all easy to hear next pleasant to hear next susceptible of sufficient variation to express a wide range of meaning and finally indicative of personality is it too quixotic to urge teachers who tell stories to little children to bear these thoughts and better ones of their own in mind not i think if it be fully accepted that the story hour as a play hour is a time peculiarly open to influences affecting the imitative faculty that this faculty is especially valuable in forming fine habits of speech and that an increasingly high and general standard of english speech is one of our greatest needs and our most instant opportunities in the american schools of to day and now we come to the stories stories to tell to children two little riddles in rhyme 1 1 these riddles were taken from the gaelic and are charming examples of the naive beauty of the old irish and of dr hyde's accurate and sympathetic modern rendering from beside the fire david nutt london there's a garden that i ken full of little gentlemen little caps of blue they wear and green ribbons very fair flax from house to house he goes a messenger small and slight and whether it rains or snows he sleeps outside in the night the path the little pink rose once there was a little pink rosebud and she lived down in a little dark house under the ground one day she was sitting there all by herself and it was very still suddenly she heard a little tap tap tap at the door who is that she said it's the rain and i want to come in said a soft sad little voice no you can't come in the little rosebud said by and by she heard another little tap tap tap on the window pane who is there she said the same soft little voice answered it's the rain and i want to come in no you can't come in said the little rosebud then it was very still for a long time at last there came a little rustling whispering sound all round the window rustle whisper whisper who is there said the little rosebud it's the sunshine said a little soft cheery voice and i want to come in n no said the little pink rose you can't come in and she sat still again pretty soon she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the key hole who is there she said it's the sunshine said the cheery little voice and i want to come in i want to come in no no said the little pink rose you cannot come in by and by as she sat so still she heard tap tap tap and rustle whisper rustle all up and down the window pane and on the door and at the key hole who is there she said it's the rain and the sun the rain and the sun said two little voices together and we want to come in we want to come in we want to come in dear dear said the little rosebud if there are two of you i s'pose i shall have to let you in so she opened the door a little wee crack and in they came and one took one of her little hands and the other took her other little hand and they ran ran ran with her right up to the top of the ground then they said poke your head through so she poked her head through and she was in the midst of a beautiful garden it was springtime and all the other flowers had their heads poked through and she was the prettiest little pink rose in the whole garden the cock a doo dle doo 1 1 from the ignominy of being grown up by dr samuel m crothers in the atlantic monthly for july 1906 a very little boy made this story up out of his head and told it to his papa i think you littlest ones will like it i do once upon a time there was a little boy and he wanted to be a cock a doo dle doo so he was a cock a doo dle doo and he wanted to fly up into the sky so he did fly up into the sky and he wanted to get wings and a tail so he did get some wings and a tail the cloud 2 2 adapted from the german of robert reinick's maarchen lieder und geschichtenbuch velhagen und klasing bielefeld and leipsic one hot summer morning a little cloud rose out of the sea and floated lightly and happily across the blue sky far below lay the earth brown dry and desolate from drouth the little cloud could see the poor people of the earth working and suffering in the hot fields while she herself floated on the morning breeze hither and thither without a care oh if i could only help the poor people down there she thought if i could but make their work easier or give the hungry ones food or the thirsty a drink and as the day passed and the cloud became larger this wish to do something for the people of earth was ever greater in her heart on earth it grew hotter and hotter the sun burned down so fiercely that the people were fainting in its rays it seemed as if they must die of heat and yet they were obliged to go on with their work for they were very poor sometimes they stood and looked up at the cloud as if they were praying and saying ah if you could help us i will help you i will said the cloud and she began to sink softly down toward the earth but suddenly as she floated down she remembered something which had been told her when she was a tiny cloud child in the lap of mother ocean it had been whispered that if the clouds go too near the earth they die when she remembered this she held herself from sinking and swayed here and there on the breeze thinking thinking but at last she stood quite still and spoke boldly and proudly she said men of earth i will help you come what may the thought made her suddenly marvelously big and strong and powerful never had she dreamed that she could be so big like a mighty angel of blessing she stood above the earth and lifted her head and spread her wings far over the fields and woods she was so great so majestic that men and animals were awe struck at the sight the trees and the grasses bowed before her yet all the earth creatures felt that she meant them well yes i will help you cried the cloud once more take me to yourselves i will give my life for you as she said the words a wonderful light glowed from her heart the sound of thunder rolled through the sky and a love greater than words can tell filled the cloud down down close to the earth she swept and gave up her life in a blessed healing shower of rain that rain was the cloud's great deed it was her death too but it was also her glory over the whole country side as far as the rain fell a lovely rainbow sprang its arch and all the brightest rays of heaven made its colors it was the last greeting of a love so great that it sacrificed itself soon that too was gone but long long afterward the men and animals who were saved by the cloud kept her blessing in their hearts the little red hen the little red hen was in the farmyard with her chickens when she found a grain of wheat who will plant this wheat she said not i said the goose not i said the duck i will then said the little red hen and she planted the grain of wheat when the wheat was ripe she said who will take this wheat to the mill not i said the goose not i said the duck i will then said the little red hen and she took the wheat to the mill when she brought the flour home she said who will make some bread with this flour not i said the goose not i said the duck i will then said the little red hen when the bread was baked she said who will eat this bread i will said the goose i will said the duck no you won't said the little red hen i shall eat it myself cluck cluck and she called her chickens to help her the gingerbread man 1 1 i have tried to give this story in the most familiar form it varies a good deal in the hands of different story tellers but this is substantially the version i was brought up on the form of the ending was suggested to me by the story in carolyn bailey's for the children's hour milton bradley co once upon a time there was a little old woman and a little old man and they lived all alone in a little old house they hadn't any little girls or any little boys at all so one day the little old woman made a boy out of gingerbread she made him a chocolate jacket and put cinnamon seeds in it for buttons his eyes were made of fine fat currants his mouth was made of rose colored sugar and he had a gay little cap of orange sugar candy when the little old woman had rolled him out and dressed him up and pinched his gingerbread shoes into shape she put him in a pan then she put the pan in the oven and shut the door and she thought now i shall have a little boy of my own when it was time for the gingerbread boy to be done she opened the oven door and pulled out the pan out jumped the little gingerbread boy on to the floor and away he ran out of the door and down the street the little old woman and the little old man ran after him as fast as they could but he just laughed and shouted run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and they couldn't catch him the little gingerbread boy ran on and on until he came to a cow by the roadside stop little gingerbread boy said the cow i want to eat you the little gingerbread boy laughed and said i have run away from a little old woman and a little old man and i can run away from you i can and as the cow chased him he looked over his shoulder and cried run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and the cow couldn't catch him the little gingerbread boy ran on and on and on till he came to a horse in the pasture please stop little gingerbread boy said the horse you look very good to eat but the little gingerbread boy laughed out loud oho oho he said i have run away from a little old woman a little old man a cow and i can run away from you i can and as the horse chased him he looked over his shoulder and cried run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and the horse couldn't catch him by and by the little gingerbread boy came to a barn full of threshers when the threshers smelled the gingerbread boy they tried to pick him up and said don't run so fast little gingerbread boy you look very good to eat but the little gingerbread boy ran harder than ever and as he ran he cried out i have run away from a little old woman a little old man a cow a horse and i can run away from you i can and when he found that he was ahead of the threshers he turned and shouted back to them run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and the threshers couldn't catch him then the little gingerbread boy ran faster than ever he ran and ran until he came to a field full of mowers when the mowers saw how fine he looked they ran after him calling out wait a bit wait a bit little gingerbread boy we wish to eat you but the little gingerbread boy laughed harder than ever and ran like the wind oho oho he said i have run away from a little old woman a little old man a cow a horse a barn full of threshers and i can run away from you i can and when he found that he was ahead of the mowers he turned and shouted back to them run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man and the mowers couldn't catch him by this time the little gingerbread boy was so proud that he didn't think anybody could catch him pretty soon he saw a fox coming across a field the fox looked at him and began to run but the little gingerbread boy shouted across to him you can't catch me the fox began to run faster and the little gingerbread boy ran faster and as he ran he chuckled i have run away from a little old woman a little old man a cow a horse a barn full of threshers a field full of mowers and i can run away from you i can run run as fast as you can you can't catch me i'm the gingerbread man why said the fox i would not catch you if i could i would not think of disturbing you just then the little gingerbread boy came to a river he could not swim across and he wanted to keep running away from the cow and the horse and the people jump on my tail and i will take you across said the fox so the little gingerbread boy jumped on the fox's tail and the fox swam into the river when he was a little way from shore he turned his head and said you are too heavy on my tail little gingerbread boy i fear i shall let you get wet jump on my back the little gingerbread boy jumped on his back a little farther out the fox said i am afraid the water will cover you there jump on my shoulder the little gingerbread boy jumped on his shoulder in the middle of the stream the fox said oh dear little gingerbread boy my shoulder is sinking jump on my nose and i can hold you out of water so the little gingerbread boy jumped on his nose the minute the fox got on shore he threw back his head and gave a snap dear me said the little gingerbread boy i am a quarter gone the next minute he said why i am half gone the next minute he said my goodness gracious i am three quarters gone and after that the little gingerbread boy never said anything more at all the little jackals and the lion 1 1 the four stories of the little jackal in this book are adapted from stories in old deccan days a collection of orally transmitted hindu folk tales which every teacher would gain by knowing in the hindu animal legends the jackal seems to play the role assigned in germanic lore to reynard the fox and to bre'r rabbit in the stories of our southern negroes he is the clever and humorous trickster who comes out of every encounter with a whole skin and turns the laugh on every enemy however mighty once there was a great big jungle and in the jungle there was a great big lion and the lion was king of the jungle whenever he wanted anything to eat all he had to do was to come up out of his cave in the stones and earth and roar when he had roared a few times all the little people of the jungle were so frightened that they came out of their holes and hiding places and ran this way and that to get away then of course the lion could see where they were and he pounced on them killed them and gobbled them up he did this so often that at last there was not a single thing left alive in the jungle besides the lion except two little jackals"
