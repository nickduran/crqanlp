"1" "thousand to see we'll sure hump you if you all come in daylight warned him it's an almighty good hunch kearns said adding his slip for two thousand to the growing heap i can feel her crawlin up and down my back i ain't got a hunch but i got a tolerable likeable hand campbell announced as he slid in his slip but it's not a raising hand mine is daylight paused and wrote i see that thousand and raise her the same old thousand the virgin standing behind him then did what a man's best friend was not privileged to do reaching over daylight's shoulder she picked up his hand and read it at the same time shielding the faces of the five cards close to his chest what she saw were three queens and a pair of eights but nobody guessed what she saw every player's eyes were on her face as she scanned the cards but no sign did she give her features might have been carved from ice for her expression was precisely the same before during and after not a muscle quivered nor was there the slightest dilation of a nostril nor the slightest increase of light in the eyes she laid the hand face down again on the table and slowly the lingering eyes withdrew from her having learned nothing macdonald smiled benevolently i see you daylight and i hump this time for two thousand how's that hunch jack still a crawling mac you got me now but that hunch is a rip snorter persuadin sort of a critter and it's my plain duty to ride it i call for three thousand and i got another hunch daylight's going to call too he sure is daylight agreed after campbell had thrown up his hand he knows when he's up against it and he plays accordin i see that two thousand and then i'll see the draw in a dead silence save for the low voices of the three players the draw was made thirty four thousand dollars were already in the pot and the play possibly not half over to the virgin's amazement daylight held up his three queens discarding his eights and calling for two cards and this time not even she dared look at what he had drawn she knew her limit of control nor did he look the two new cards lay face down on the table where they had been dealt to him cards kearns asked of macdonald got enough was the reply you can draw if you want to you know kearns warned him nope this'll do me kearns himself drew two cards but did not look at them still harnish let his cards lie i never bet in the teeth of a pat hand he said slowly looking at the saloon keeper you all start her rolling mac macdonald counted his cards carefully to make double sure it was not a foul hand wrote a sum on a paper slip and slid it into the pot with the simple utterance five thousand kearns with every eye upon him looked at his two card draw counted the other three to dispel any doubt of holding more than five cards and wrote on a betting slip i see you mac he said and i raise her a little thousand just so as not to keep daylight out the concentrated gaze shifted to daylight he likewise examined his draw and counted his five cards i see that six thousand and i raise her five thousand just to try and keep you out jack and i raise you five thousand just to lend a hand at keeping jack out macdonald said in turn his voice was slightly husky and strained and a nervous twitch in the corner of his mouth followed speech kearns was pale and those who looked on noted that his hand trembled as he wrote his slip but his voice was unchanged i lift her along for five thousand he said daylight was now the centre the kerosene lamps above flung high lights from the rash of sweat on his forehead the bronze of his cheeks was darkened by the accession of blood his black eyes glittered and his nostrils were distended and eager they were large nostrils tokening his descent from savage ancestors who had survived by virtue of deep lungs and generous air passages yet unlike macdonald his voice was firm and customary and unlike kearns his hand did not tremble when he wrote i call for ten thousand he said not that i'm afraid of you all mac it's that hunch of jack's i hump his hunch for five thousand just the same said macdonald i had the best hand before the draw and i still guess i got it mebbe this is a case where a hunch after the draw is better'n the hunch before kearns remarked wherefore duty says lift her jack lift her and so i lift her another five thousand daylight leaned back in his chair and gazed up at the kerosene lamps while he computed aloud i was in nine thousand before the draw and i saw and raised eleven thousand that makes thirty i'm only good for ten more he leaned forward and looked at kearns so i call that ten thousand you can raise if you want kearns answered your dogs are good for five thousand in this game nary dawg you all can win my dust and dirt but nary one of my dawgs i just call macdonald considered for a long time no one moved or whispered not a muscle was relaxed on the part of the onlookers not the weight of a body shifted from one leg to the other it was a sacred silence only could be heard the roaring draft of the huge stove and from without muffled by the log walls the howling of dogs it was not every night that high stakes were played on the yukon and for that matter this was the highest in the history of the country the saloon keeper finally spoke if anybody else wins they'll have to take a mortgage on the tivoli the two other players nodded so i call too macdonald added his slip for five thousand not one of them claimed the pot and not one of them called the size of his hand simultaneously and in silence they faced their cards on the table while a general tiptoeing and craning of necks took place among the onlookers daylight showed four queens and an ace macdonald four jacks and an ace and kearns four kings and a trey kearns reached forward with an encircling movement of his arm and drew the pot in to him his arm shaking as he did so daylight picked the ace from his hand and tossed it over alongside macdonald's ace saying that's what cheered me along mac i knowed it was only kings that could beat me and he had them what did you all have he asked all interest turning to campbell straight flush of four open at both ends a good drawing hand you bet you could a made a straight a straight flush or a flush out of it that's what i thought campbell said sadly it cost me six thousand before i quit i wisht you all'd drawn daylight laughed then i wouldn't a caught that fourth queen now i've got to take billy rawlins mail contract and mush for dyea what's the size of the killing jack kearns attempted to count the pot but was too excited daylight drew it across to him with firm fingers separating and stacking the markers and i.o.u s and with clear brain adding the sum one hundred and twenty seven thousand he announced you all can sell out now jack and head for home the winner smiled and nodded but seemed incapable of speech i'd shout the drinks macdonald said only the house don't belong to me any more yes it does kearns replied first wetting his lips with his tongue your note's good for any length of time but the drinks are on me name your snake juice you all the winner pays daylight called out loudly to all about him at the same time rising from his chair and catching the virgin by the arm come on for a reel you all dancers the night's young yet and it's helen breakfast and the mail contract for me in the morning here you all rawlins you i hereby do take over that same contract and i start for salt water at nine a.m savvee come on you all where's that fiddler chapter iii it was daylight's night he was the centre and the head of the revel unquenchably joyous a contagion of fun he multiplied himself and in so doing multiplied the excitement no prank he suggested was too wild for his followers and all followed save those that developed into singing imbeciles and fell warbling by the wayside yet never did trouble intrude it was known on the yukon that when burning daylight made a night of it wrath and evil were forbidden on his nights men dared not quarrel in the younger days such things had happened and then men had known what real wrath was and been man handled as only burning daylight could man handle on his nights men must laugh and be happy or go home daylight was inexhaustible in between dances he paid over to kearns the twenty thousand in dust and transferred to him his moosehide claim likewise he arranged the taking over of billy rawlins mail contract and made his preparations for the start he despatched a messenger to rout out kama his dog driver a tananaw indian far wandered from his tribal home in the service of the invading whites kama entered the tivoli tall lean muscular and fur clad the pick of his barbaric race and barbaric still unshaken and unabashed by the revellers that rioted about him while daylight gave his orders um said kama tabling his instructions on his fingers get um letters from rawlins load um on sled grub for selkirk you think um plenty dog grub stop selkirk plenty dog grub kama um bring sled this place nine um clock bring um snowshoes no bring um tent mebbe bring um fly um little fly no fly daylight answered decisively um much cold we travel light savvee we carry plenty letters out plenty letters back you are strong man plenty cold plenty travel all right sure all right kama muttered with resignation much cold no care a damn um ready nine um clock he turned on his moccasined heel and walked out imperturbable sphinx like neither giving nor receiving greetings nor looking to right or left the virgin led daylight away into a corner look here daylight she said in a low voice you're busted higher'n a kite i've eight thousand in mac's safe she began but daylight interrupted the apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt it don't matter he said busted i came into the world busted i go out and i've been busted most of the time since i arrived come on let's waltz but listen she urged my money's doing nothing i could lend it to you a grub stake she added hurriedly at sight of the alarm in his face nobody grub stakes me was the answer i stake myself and when i make a killing it's sure all mine no thank you old girl much obliged i'll get my stake by running the mail out and in daylight she murmured in tender protest but with a sudden well assumed ebullition of spirits he drew her toward the dancing floor and as they swung around and around in a waltz she pondered on the iron heart of the man who held her in his arms and resisted all her wiles at six the next morning scorching with whiskey yet ever himself he stood at the bar putting every man's hand down the way of it was that two men faced each other across a corner their right elbows resting on the bar their right hands gripped together while each strove to press the other's hand down man after man came against him but no man put his hand down even olaf henderson and french louis failing despite their hugeness when they contended it was a trick a trained muscular knack he challenged them to another test look here you all he cried i'm going to do two things first weigh my sack and second bet it that after you all have lifted clean from the floor all the sacks of flour you all are able i'll put on two more sacks and lift the whole caboodle clean by gar ah take dat french louis rumbled above the cheers hold on olaf henderson cried i ban yust as good as you louis i yump half that bet put on the scales daylight's sack was found to balance an even four hundred dollars and louis and olaf divided the bet between them fifty pound sacks of flour were brought in from macdonald's cache other men tested their strength first they straddled on two chairs the flour sacks beneath them on the floor and held together by rope lashings many of the men were able in this manner to lift four or five hundred pounds while some succeeded with as high as six hundred then the two giants took a hand tying at seven hundred french louis then added another sack and swung seven hundred and fifty clear olaf duplicated the performance whereupon both failed to clear eight hundred again and again they strove their foreheads beaded with sweat their frames crackling with the effort both were able to shift the weight and to bump it but clear the floor with it they could not by gar daylight dis tam you mek one beeg meestake french louis said straightening up and stepping down from the chairs only one damn iron man can do dat one hundred pun more my frien not ten poun more the sacks were unlashed but when two sacks were added kearns interfered only one sack more two some one cried two was the bet they didn't lift that last sack kearns protested they only lifted seven hundred and fifty but daylight grandly brushed aside the confusion what's the good of you all botherin around that way what's one more sack if i can't lift three more i sure can't lift two put em in he stood upon the chairs squatted and bent his shoulders down till his hands closed on the rope he shifted his feet slightly tautened his muscles with a tentative pull then relaxed again questing for a perfect adjustment of all the levers of his body french louis looking on sceptically cried out pool lak hell daylight pool lak hell daylight's muscles tautened a second time and this time in earnest until steadily all the energy of his splendid body was applied and quite imperceptibly without jerk or strain the bulky nine hundred pounds rose from the door and swung back and forth pendulum like between his legs olaf henderson sighed a vast audible sigh the virgin who had tensed unconsciously till her muscles hurt her relaxed while french louis murmured reverently m'sieu daylight salut ay am one beeg baby you are one beeg man daylight dropped his burden leaped to the floor and headed for the bar weigh in he cried tossing his sack to the weigher who transferred to it four hundred dollars from the sacks of the two losers surge up everybody daylight went on name your snake juice the winner pays this is my night he was shouting ten minutes later i'm the lone he wolf and i've seen thirty winters this is my birthday my one day in the year and i can put any man on his back come on you all i'm going to put you all in the snow come on you chechaquos 1 and sourdoughs 2 and get your baptism the rout streamed out of doors all save the barkeepers and the singing bacchuses some fleeting thought of saving his own dignity entered macdonald's head for he approached daylight with outstretched hand what you first daylight laughed clasping the other's hand as if in greeting no no the other hurriedly disclaimed just congratulations on your birthday of course you can put me in the snow what chance have i against a man that lifts nine hundred pounds macdonald weighed one hundred and eighty pounds and daylight had him gripped solely by his hand yet by a sheer abrupt jerk he took the saloon keeper off his feet and flung him face downward in the snow in quick succession seizing the men nearest him he threw half a dozen more resistance was useless they flew helter skelter out of his grips landing in all manner of attitudes grotesquely and harmlessly in the soft snow it soon became difficult in the dim starlight to distinguish between those thrown and those waiting their turn and he began feeling their backs and shoulders determining their status by whether or not he found them powdered with snow baptized yet became his stereotyped question as he reached out his terrible hands several score lay down in the snow in a long row while many others knelt in mock humility scooping snow upon their heads and claiming the rite accomplished but a group of five stood upright backwoodsmen and frontiersmen they eager to contest any man's birthday graduates of the hardest of man handling schools veterans of multitudes of rough and tumble battles men of blood and sweat and endurance they nevertheless lacked one thing that daylight possessed in high degree namely an almost perfect brain and muscular coordination it was simple in its way and no virtue of his he had been born with this endowment his nerves carried messages more quickly than theirs his mental processes culminating in acts of will were quicker than theirs his muscles themselves by some immediacy of chemistry obeyed the messages of his will quicker than theirs he was so made his muscles were high power explosives the levers of his body snapped into play like the jaws of steel traps and in addition to all this his was that super strength that is the dower of but one human in millions a strength depending not on size but on degree a supreme organic excellence residing in the stuff of the muscles themselves thus so swiftly could he apply a stress that before an opponent could become aware and resist the aim of the stress had been accomplished in turn so swiftly did he become aware of a stress applied to him that he saved himself by resistance or by delivering a lightning counter stress it ain't no use you all standing there daylight addressed the waiting group you all might as well get right down and take your baptizing you all might down me any other day in the year but on my birthday i want you all to know i'm the best man is that pat hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing come on pat pat hanrahan ex bare knuckle prize fighter and roughhouse expert stepped forth the two men came against each other in grips and almost before he had exerted himself the irishman found himself in the merciless vise of a half nelson that buried him head and shoulders in the snow joe hines ex lumber jack came down with an impact equal to a fall from a two story building his overthrow accomplished by a cross buttock delivered he claimed before he was ready there was nothing exhausting in all this to daylight he did not heave and strain through long minutes no time practically was occupied his body exploded abruptly and terrifically in one instant and on the next instant was relaxed thus doc watson the gray bearded iron bodied man without a past a fighting terror himself was overthrown in the fraction of a second preceding his own onslaught as he was in the act of gathering himself for a spring daylight was upon him and with such fearful suddenness as to crush him backward and down olaf henderson receiving his cue from this attempted to take daylight unaware rushing upon him from one side as he stooped with extended hand to help doc watson up daylight dropped on his hands and knees receiving in his side olaf's knees olaf's momentum carried him clear over the obstruction in a long flying fall before he could rise daylight had whirled him over on his back and was rubbing his face and ears with snow and shoving handfuls down his neck ay ban yust as good a man as you ban daylight olaf spluttered as he pulled himself to his feet but by yupiter i ban navver see a grip like that french louis was the last of the five and he had seen enough to make him cautious he circled and baffled for a full minute before coming to grips and for another full minute they strained and reeled without either winning the advantage and then just as the contest was becoming interesting daylight effected one of his lightning shifts changing all stresses and leverages and at the same time delivering one of his muscular explosions french louis resisted till his huge frame crackled and then slowly was forced over and under and downward the winner pays daylight cried as he sprang to his feet and led the way back into the tivoli surge along you all this way to the snake room they lined up against the long bar in places two or three deep stamping the frost from their moccasined feet for outside the temperature was sixty below bettles himself one of the gamest of the old timers in deeds and daring ceased from his drunken lay of the sassafras root and titubated over to congratulate daylight but in the midst of it he felt impelled to make a speech and raised his voice oratorically i tell you fellers i'm plum proud to call daylight my friend we've hit the trail together afore now and he's eighteen carat from his moccasins up damn his mangy old hide anyway he was a shaver when he first hit this country when you fellers was his age you wa'n't dry behind the ears yet he never was no kid he was born a full grown man an i tell you a man had to be a man in them days this wa'n't no effete civilization like it's come to be now bettles paused long enough to put his arm in a proper bear hug around daylight's neck when you an me mushed into the yukon in the good ole days it didn't rain soup and they wa'n't no free lunch joints our camp fires was lit where we killed our game and most of the time we lived on salmon tracks and rabbit bellies ain't i right but at the roar of laughter that greeted his inversion bettles released the bear hug and turned fiercely on them laugh you mangy short horns laugh but i tell you plain and simple the best of you ain't knee high fit to tie daylight's moccasin strings ain't i right campbell ain't i right mac daylight's one of the old guard one of the real sour doughs and in them days they wa'n't ary a steamboat or ary a trading post and we cusses had to live offen salmon bellies and rabbit tracks he gazed triumphantly around and in the applause that followed arose cries for a speech from daylight he signified his consent a chair was brought and he was helped to stand upon it he was no more sober than the crowd above which he now towered a wild crowd uncouthly garmented every foot moccasined or muc lucked 3 with mittens dangling from necks and with furry ear flaps raised so that they took on the seeming of the winged helmets of the norsemen daylight's black eyes were flashing and the flush of strong drink flooded darkly under the bronze of his cheeks he was greeted with round on round of affectionate cheers which brought a suspicious moisture to his eyes albeit many of the voices were inarticulate and inebriate and yet men have so behaved since the world began feasting fighting and carousing whether in the dark cave mouth or by the fire of the squatting place in the palaces of imperial rome and the rock strongholds of robber barons or in the sky aspiring hotels of modern times and in the boozing dens of sailor town just so were these men empire builders in the arctic light boastful and drunken and clamorous winning surcease for a few wild moments from the grim reality of their heroic toil modern heroes they and in nowise different from the heroes of old time well fellows i don't know what to say to you all daylight began lamely striving still to control his whirling brain i think i'll tell you all a story i had a pardner wunst down in juneau he come from north caroliney and he used to tell this same story to me it was down in the mountains in his country and it was a wedding there they was the family and all the friends the parson was just puttin on the last touches and he says they as the lord have joined let no man put asunder parson says the bridegroom i rises to question your grammar in that there sentence i want this weddin done right when the smoke clears away the bride she looks around and sees a dead parson a dead bridegroom a dead brother two dead uncles and five dead wedding guests so she heaves a mighty strong sigh and says them new fangled self cocking revolvers sure has played hell with my prospects and so i say to you all daylight added as the roar of laughter died down that them four kings of jack kearns sure has played hell with my prospects i'm busted higher'n a kite and i'm hittin the trail for dyea goin out some one called a spasm of anger wrought on his face for a flashing instant but in the next his good humor was back again i know you all are only pokin fun asking such a question he said with a smile of course i ain't going out take the oath again daylight the same voice cried i sure will i first come over chilcoot in 83 i went out over the pass in a fall blizzard with a rag of a shirt and a cup of raw flour i got my grub stake in juneau that winter and in the spring i went over the pass once more and once more the famine drew me out next spring i went in again and i swore then that i'd never come out till i made my stake well i ain't made it and here i am and i ain't going out now i get the mail and i come right back i won't stop the night at dyea i'll hit up chilcoot soon as i change the dogs and get the mail and grub and so i swear once more by the mill tails of hell and the head of john the baptist i'll never hit for the outside till i make my pile and i tell you all here and now it's got to be an almighty big pile how much might you call a pile bettles demanded from beneath his arms clutched lovingly around daylight's legs yes how much what do you call a pile others cried daylight steadied himself for a moment and debated four or five millions he said slowly and held up his hand for silence as his statement was received with derisive yells i'll be real conservative and put the bottom notch at a million and for not an ounce less'n that will i go out of the country again his statement was received with an outburst of derision not only had the total gold output of the yukon up to date been below five millions but no man had ever made a strike of a hundred thousand much less of a million you all listen to me you seen jack kearns get a hunch to night we had him sure beat before the draw his ornery three kings was no good but he just knew there was another king coming that was his hunch and he got it and i tell you all i got a hunch there's a big strike coming on the yukon and it's just about due i don't mean no ornery moosehide birch creek kind of a strike i mean a real rip snorter hair raiser i tell you all she's in the air and hell bent for election nothing can stop her and she'll come up river there's where you all track my moccasins in the near future if you all want to find me somewhere in the country around stewart river indian river and klondike river when i get back with the mail i'll head that way so fast you all won't see my trail for smoke she's a coming fellows gold from the grass roots down a hundred dollars to the pan and a stampede in from the outside fifty thousand strong you all'll think all hell's busted loose when that strike is made he raised his glass to his lips here's kindness and hoping you all will be in on it he drank and stepped down from the"
