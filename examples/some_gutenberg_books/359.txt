returned joyfully helen and the stepmother wondered at seeing the fruit where did you gather them asked the stepsister there are more on the mountain top answered marouckla then why did you not bring more said helen angrily you must have eaten them on your way back you wicked girl no dear sister i have not even tasted them said marouckla i shook the tree twice one apple fell each time some shepherds would not allow me to shake it again but told me to return home listen mother said helen give me my cloak i will fetch some more apples myself i shall be able to find the mountain and the tree the shepherds may cry stop but i will not leave go till i have shaken down all the apples in spite of her mother's advice she wrapped herself in her pelisse put on a warm hood and took the road to the mountain snow covered everything helen lost herself and wandered hither and thither after a while she saw a light above her and following in its direction reached the mountain top there was the flaming fire the twelve blocks of stone and the twelve months at first she was frightened and hesitated then she came nearer and warmed her hands she did not ask permission nor did she speak one polite word what hath brought thee here what dost thou seek said the great january severely i am not obliged to tell you old graybeard what business is it of yours she replied disdainfully turning her back on the fire and going toward the forest the great january frowned and waved his wand over his head instantly the sky became covered with clouds the fire went down snow fell in large flakes an icy wind howled round the mountain amid the fury of the storm helen stumbled about the pelisse failed to warm her benumbed limbs the mother kept on waiting for her she looked from the window she watched from the doorstep but her daughter came not the hours passed slowly but helen did not return can it be that the apples have charmed her from her home thought the mother then she clad herself in hood and pelisse and went in search of her daughter snow fell in huge masses it covered all things for long she wandered hither and thither the icy northeast wind whistled in the mountain but no voice answered her cries day after day marouckla worked and prayed and waited but neither stepmother nor sister returned they had been frozen to death on the mountain the inheritance of a small house a field and a cow fell to marouckla in course of time an honest farmer came to share them with her and their lives were happy and peaceful the mail coach passengers by hans christian andersen adapted it was bitterly cold the sky glittered with stars and not a breeze stirred bump an old pot was thrown at a neighbor's door and bang bang went the guns for they were greeting the new year it was new year's eve and the church clock was striking twelve tan ta ra ra tan ta ra ra sounded the horn and the mail coach came lumbering up the clumsy vehicle stopped at the gate of the town all the places had been taken for there were twelve passengers in the coach hurrah hurrah cried the people in the town for in every house the new year was being welcomed and as the clock struck they stood up the full glasses in their hands to drink success to the newcomer a happy new year was the cry a pretty wife plenty of money and no sorrow or care the wish passed round and the glasses clashed together till they rang again while before the town gate the mail coach stopped with the twelve strange passengers and who were these strangers each of them had his passport and his luggage with him they even brought presents for me and for you and for all the people in the town who were they what did they want and what did they bring with them good morning they cried to the sentry at the town gate good morning replied the sentry for the clock had struck twelve your name and profession asked the sentry of the one who alighted first from the carriage see for yourself in the passport he replied i am myself and a famous fellow he looked arrayed in bearskin and fur boots come to me to morrow and i will give you a new year's present i throw shillings and pence among the people i give balls every night no less than thirty one indeed that is the highest number i can spare for balls my ships are often frozen in but in my offices it is warm and comfortable my name is january i am a merchant and i generally bring my accounts with me then the second alighted he seemed a merry fellow he was a director of a theater a manager of masked balls and a leader of all the amusements we can imagine his luggage consisted of a great cask we'll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time said he i'll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too unfortunately i have not long to live the shortest time in fact of my whole family only twenty eight days sometimes they pop me in a day extra but i trouble myself very little about that hurrah you must not shout so said the sentry certainly i may shout retorted the man i'm prince carnival traveling under the name of february the third now got out he looked the personification of fasting but he carried his nose very high for he was a weather prophet in his buttonhole he wore a little bunch of violets but they were very small march march the fourth passenger called after him slapping him on the shoulder don't you smell something good make haste into the guard room they are feasting in there i can smell it already forward master march but it was not true the speaker only wanted to make an april fool of him for with that fun the fourth stranger generally began his career he looked very jovial and did little work if the world were only more settled said he but sometimes i'm obliged to be in a good humor and sometimes a bad one i can laugh or cry according to circumstances i have my summer wardrobe in this box here but it would be very foolish to put it on now after him a lady stepped out of the coach she called herself miss may she wore a summer dress and overshoes her dress was light green and there were anemones in her hair she was so scented with wild thyme that it made the sentry sneeze your health and god bless you was her greeting how pretty she was and such a singer not a theater singer nor a ballad singer no but a singer of the woods for she wandered through the gay green forest and had a concert there for her own amusement now comes the young lady said those in the coach and out stepped a young dame delicate proud and pretty it was mistress june in her service people become lazy and fond of sleeping for hours she gives a feast on the longest day of the year that there may be time for her guests to partake of the numerous dishes at her table indeed she keeps her own carriage but still she travels by the mail coach with the rest because she wishes to show that she is not proud but she was not without a protector her younger brother july was with her he was a plump young fellow clad in summer garments and wearing a straw hat he had very little luggage because it was so cumbersome in the great heat he had however swimming trousers with him which are nothing to carry then came the mother herself madame august a wholesale dealer in fruit proprietress of a large number of fish ponds and a land cultivator she was fat and warm yet she could use her hands well and would herself carry out food to the laborers in the field after work came the recreations dancing and playing in the greenwood and the harvest home she was a thorough housewife after her a man stepped out of the coach he is a painter a master of colors and is named september the forest on his arrival has to change its colors and how beautiful are those he chooses the woods glow with red and gold and brown this great master painter can whistle like a blackbird there he stood with his color pot in his hand and that was the whole of his luggage a landowner followed who in the month for sowing seed attends to his ploughing and is fond of field sports squire october brought his dog and his gun with him and had nuts in his game bag crack crack he had a great deal of luggage even a plough he spoke of farming but what he said could scarcely be heard for the coughing and sneezing of his neighbor it was november who coughed violently as he got out he had a cold but he said he thought it would leave him when he went out woodcutting for he had to supply wood to the whole parish he spent his evenings making skates for he knew he said that in a few weeks they would be needed at length the last passenger made her appearance old mother december the dame was very aged but her eyes glistened like two stars she carried on her arm a flower pot in which a little fir tree was growing this tree i shall guard and cherish she said that it may grow large by christmas eve and reach from the floor to the ceiling to be adorned with lighted candles golden apples and toys i shall sit by the fireplace and bring a story book out of my pocket and read aloud to all the little children then the toys on the tree will become alive and the little waxen angel at the top will spread out his wings of gold leaf and fly down from his green perch he will kiss every child in the room yes and all the little children who stand out in the street singing a carol about the star of bethlehem well now the coach may drive away said the sentry we will keep all the twelve months here with us first let the twelve come to me said the captain on duty one after another the passports i will keep here each of them for one month when that has passed i shall write the behavior of each stranger on his passport mr january have the goodness to come here and mr january stepped forward when a year has passed i think i shall be able to tell you what the twelve passengers have brought to you to me and to all of us just now i do not know and probably even they do not know themselves for we live in strange times lincoln's birthday february 12 he rescues the birds by noah brooks adapted once while riding through the country with some other lawyers lincoln was missed from the party and was seen loitering near a thicket of wild plum trees where the men had stopped a short time before to water their horses where is lincoln asked one of the lawyers when i saw him last answered another he had caught two young birds that the wind had blown out of their nest and was hunting for the nest to put them back again as lincoln joined them the lawyers rallied him on his tender heartedness and he said i could not have slept unless i had restored those little birds to their mother lincoln and the little girl by charles w moores in the old days when lincoln was one of the leading lawyers of the state he noticed a little girl of ten who stood beside a trunk in front of her home crying bitterly he stopped to learn what was wrong and was told that she was about to miss a long promised visit to decatur because the wagon had not come for her you needn't let that trouble you was his cheering reply just come along with me and we shall make it all right lifting the trunk upon his shoulder and taking the little girl by the hand he went through the streets of springfield a half mile to the railway station put her and her trunk on the train and sent her away with a happiness in her heart that is still there training for the presidency by orison swett marden i meant to take good care of your book mr crawford said the boy but i've damaged it a good deal without intending to and now i want to make it right with you what shall i do to make it good why what happened to it abe asked the rich farmer as he took the copy of weems's life of washington which he had lent young lincoln and looked at the stained leaves and warped binding it looks as if it had been out through all last night's storm how came you to forget and leave it out to soak it was this way mr crawford replied abe i sat up late to read it and when i went to bed i put it away carefully in my bookcase as i call it a little opening between two logs in the wall of our cabin i dreamed about general washington all night when i woke up i took it out to read a page or two before i did the chores and you can't imagine how i felt when i found it in this shape it seems that the mud daubing had got out of the weather side of that crack and the rain must have dripped on it three or four hours before i took it out i'm sorry mr crawford and want to fix it up with you if you can tell me how for i have not got money to pay for it well said mr crawford come and shuck corn three days and the book s yours had mr crawford told young abraham lincoln that he had fallen heir to a fortune the boy could hardly have felt more elated shuck corn only three days and earn the book that told all about his greatest hero i don't intend to shuck corn split rails and the like always he told mrs crawford after he had read the volume i'm going to fit myself for a profession why what do you want to be now asked mrs crawford in surprise oh i'll be president said abe with a smile you'd make a pretty president with all your tricks and jokes now wouldn't you said the farmer's wife oh i'll study and get ready replied the boy and then maybe the chance will come why lincoln was called honest abe by noah brooks in managing the country store as in everything that he undertook for others lincoln did his very best he was honest civil ready to do anything that should encourage customers to come to the place full of pleasantries patient and alert on one occasion finding late at night when he counted over his cash that he had taken a few cents from a customer more than was due he closed the store and walked a long distance to make good the deficiency at another time discovering on the scales in the morning a weight with which he had weighed out a package of tea for a woman the night before he saw that he had given her too little for her money he weighed out what was due and carried it to her much to the surprise of the woman who had not known that she was short in the amount of her purchase innumerable incidents of this sort are related of lincoln and we should not have space to tell of the alertness with which he sprang to protect defenseless women from insult or feeble children from tyranny for in the rude community in which he lived the rights of the defenseless were not always respected as they should have been there were bullies then as now a stranger at five points adapted one afternoon in february 1860 when the sunday school of the five point house of industry in new york was assembled the teacher saw a most remarkable man enter the room and take his place among the others this stranger was tall his frame was gaunt and sinewy his head powerful with determined features overcast by a gentle melancholy he listened with fixed attention to the exercises his face expressed such genuine interest that the teacher approaching him suggested that he might have something to say to the children the stranger accepted the invitation with evident pleasure coming forward he began to speak and at once fascinated every child in the room his language was beautiful yet simple his tones were musical and he spoke with deep feeling the faces of the boys and girls drooped sadly as he uttered warnings and then brightened with joy as he spoke cheerful words of promise once or twice he tried to close his remarks but the children shouted go on oh do go on and he was forced to continue at last he finished his talk and was leaving the room quietly when the teacher begged to know his name abra'm lincoln of illinois was the modest response a solomon come to judgment by charles w moores lincoln's practical sense and his understanding of human nature enabled him to save the life of the son of his old clary's grove friend jack armstrong who was on trial for murder lincoln learning of it went to the old mother who had been kind to him in the days of his boyhood poverty and promised her that he would get her boy free the witnesses were sure that armstrong was guilty and one of them declared that he had seen the fatal blow struck it was late at night he said and the light of the full moon had made it possible for him to see the crime committed lincoln on cross examination asked him only questions enough to make the jury see that it was the full moon that made it possible for the witness to see what occurred got him to say two or three times that he was sure of it and seemed to give up any further effort to save the boy but when the evidence was finished and lincoln's time came to make his argument he called for an almanac which the clerk of the court had ready for him and handed it to the jury they saw at once that on the night of the murder there was no moon at all they were satisfied that the witness had told what was not true lincoln's case was won george pickett's friend by charles w moores george pickett who had known lincoln in illinois years before joined the southern army and by his conspicuous bravery and ability had become one of the great generals of the confederacy toward the close of the war when a large part of virginia had fallen into the possession of the union army the president called at general pickett's virginia home the general's wife with her baby on her arm met him at the door she herself has told the story for us is this george pickett's home he asked with all the courage and dignity i could muster i replied yes and i am his wife and this is his baby i am abraham lincoln the president i gasped i had never seen him but i knew the intense love and reverence with which my soldier always spoke of him the stranger shook his head and replied no abraham lincoln george's old friend the baby pushed away from me and reached out his hands to mr lincoln who took him in his arms as he did so an expression of rapt almost divine tenderness and love lighted up the sad face it was a look that i have never seen on any other face the baby opened his mouth wide and insisted upon giving his father's friend a dewy kiss as mr lincoln gave the little one back to me he said tell your father the rascal that i forgive him for the sake of your bright eyes lincoln the lawyer by z a mudge adapted he delighted to advocate the cases of those whom he knew to be wronged but he would not defend the cause of the guilty if he discovered in the course of a trial that he was on the wrong side he lost all interest and ceased to make any exertion once while engaged in a prosecution he discovered that his client's cause was not a good one and he refused to make the plea his associate who was less scrupulous made the plea and obtained a decision in their favor the fee was nine hundred dollars half of which was tendered to mr lincoln but he refused to accept a single cent of it his honesty was strongly illustrated by the way he kept his accounts with his law partner when he had taken a fee in the latter's absence he put one half of it into his own pocket and laid the other half carefully away labeling it billy the name by which he familiarly addressed his partner when asked why he did not make a record of the amount and for the time being use the whole mr lincoln answered because i promised my mother never to use money belonging to another person the courage of his convictions adapted mr lincoln made the great speech of his famous senatorial campaign at springfield illinois the convention before which he spoke consisted of a thousand delegates together with the crowd that had gathered with them his speech was carefully prepared every sentence was guarded and emphatic it has since become famous as the divided house speech before entering the hall where it was to be delivered he stepped into the office of his law partner mr herndon and locking the door so that their interview might be private took his manuscript from his pocket and read one of the opening sentences i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free mr herndon remarked that the sentiment was true but suggested that it might not be good policy to utter it at that time mr lincoln replied with great firmness no matter about the policy it is true and the nation is entitled to it the proposition has been true for six thousand years and i will deliver it as it is written mr lincoln and the bible by z a mudge adapted a visitor in washington once had an appointment to see mr lincoln at five o'clock in the morning the gentleman made a hasty toilet and presented himself at a quarter of five in the waiting room of the president he asked the usher if he could see mr lincoln no he replied but i have an engagement to meet him this morning answered the visitor at what hour asked the usher at five o'clock well sir he will see you at five the visitor waited patiently walking to and fro for a few minutes when he heard a voice as if in grave conversation who is talking in the next room he asked it is the president sir said the usher who then explained that it was mr lincoln's custom to spend every morning from four to five reading the scriptures and praying his springfield farewell address it was on the morning of february 11 1861 that the president elect together with his family and a small party of friends bade adieu to the city of springfield which alas he was never to see again a large throng of springfield citizens assembled at the railway station to see the departure and before the train left mr lincoln addressed them in the following words my friends no one not in my position can appreciate the sadness i feel at this parting to this people i owe all that i am here i have lived more than a quarter of a century here my children were born and here one of them lies buried i know not how soon i shall see you again a duty devolves upon me which is perhaps greater than that which has devolved upon any other man since the days of washington he never would have succeeded except by the aid of divine providence upon which he at all times relied i feel that i cannot succeed without the same divine aid which sustained him and on the same almighty being i place my reliance for support and i hope you my friends will all pray that i may receive that divine assistance without which i cannot succeed but with which success is certain again i bid you an affectionate farewell saint valentine's day february 14 saint valentine the good saint valentine was a priest at rome in the days of claudius ii he and saint marius aided the christian martyrs and for this kind deed saint valentine was apprehended and dragged before the prefect of rome who condemned him to be beaten to death with clubs and to have his head cut off he suffered martyrdom on the 14th day of february about the year 270 at that time it was the custom in rome a very ancient custom indeed to celebrate in the month of february the lupercalia feasts in honor of a heathen god on these occasions amidst a variety of pagan ceremonies the names of young women were placed in a box from which they were drawn by the men as chance directed the pastors of the early christian church in rome endeavored to do away with the pagan element in these feasts by substituting the names of saints for those of maidens and as the lupercalia began about the middle of february the pastors appear to have chosen saint valentine's day for the celebration of this new feast so it seems that the custom of young men choosing maidens for valentines or saints as patrons for the coming year arose in this wise a prisoner's valentine by millicent olmsted adapted charles duke of orleans who was taken prisoner at the battle of agincourt in 1415 and detained in england twenty five years was the author of the earliest known written valentines he left about sixty of them they were written during his confinement in the tower of london and are still to be seen among the royal papers in the british museum one of his valentines reads as follows wilt thou be mine dear love reply sweetly consent or else deny whisper softly none shall know wilt thou be mine love aye or no spite of fortune we may be happy by one word from thee life flies swiftly ere it go wilt thou be mine love aye or no a girl's valentine charm as told by herself from the connoisseur 1775 last friday was valentine's day and i'll tell you what i did the night before i got five bay leaves and pinned four of them to the four corners of my pillow and the fifth to the middle and then if i dreamt of my sweetheart betty said we would be married before the year was out but to make it more sure i boiled an egg hard and took out the yolk and filled it with salt and when i went to bed ate it shell and all without speaking or drinking after it we also wrote our lovers names upon bits of paper and rolled them up in clay and put them into water and the first that rose up was to be our valentine would you think it mr blossom was my man and i lay abed and shut my eyes all the morning till he came to our house for i would not have seen another man before him for all the world mr pepys his valentine as related by himself in 1666 adapted this morning came up to my wife's bedside i being up dressing myself little will mercer to be her valentine and brought her name writ upon blue paper in gold letters done by himself very pretty and we were both well pleased with it but i am also this year my wife's valentine and it will cost me five pounds but that i must have laid out if we had not been valentines i find also that mrs pierce's little girl is my valentine she having drawn me which i am not sorry for it easing me of something more that i must have given to others but here i do first observe the fashion of drawing of mottoes as well as names so that pierce who drew my wife did draw also a motto and this girl drew another for me what mine"
