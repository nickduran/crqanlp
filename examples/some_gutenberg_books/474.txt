"1" "the attention chained by crude force of interest the children begin to expect something interesting from the teacher and to wait for it and having been led step by step from one grade of a logical sequence to another their minds at first beguiled by the fascination of the steps glide into the habit of following any logical sequence my club formed its habit as far as i was concerned all in one session the ordinary demands of school procedure lengthen the process but the result is equally sure by the end of a week in which the children have listened happily to a story every day the habit of listening and deducing has been formed and the expectation of pleasantness is connected with the opening of the teacher's lips these two benefits are well worth the trouble they cost and for these two at least any teacher who tells a story well may confidently look the quick gaining of a confidential relation with the children and the gradual development of concentration and interested attention in them these are direct and somewhat clearly discernible results comfortably placed in a near future there are other aims reaching on into the far slow modes of psychological growth which must equally determine the choice of the story teller's material and inform the spirit of her work these other less immediately attainable ends i wish now to consider in relation to the different types of story by which they are severally best served first unbidden claimant of attention comes the fairy story no one can think of a child and a story without thinking of the fairy tale is this as some would have us believe a bad habit of an ignorant old world or can the fairy tale justify her popularity with truly edifying and educational results is she a proper person to introduce here and what are her titles to merit oh dear yes dame fairy tale comes bearing a magic wand in her wrinkled old fingers with one wave of which she summons up that very spirit of joy which it is our chief effort to invoke she raps smartly on the door and open sesames echo to every imagination her red heeled shoes twinkle down an endless lane of adventures and every real child's footsteps quicken after she is the natural own great grandmother of every child in the world and her pocketfuls of treasures are his by right of inheritance shut her out and you truly rob the children of something which is theirs something marking their constant kinship with the race children of the past and adapted to their needs as it was to those of the generation of long ago if there were no other criterion at all it would be enough that the children love the fairy tale we give them fairy stories first because they like them but that by no means lessens the importance of the fact that fairy tales are also good for them how good in various ways first perhaps in their supreme power of presenting truth through the guise of images this is the way the race child took toward wisdom and it is the way each child's individual instinct takes after him elemental truths of moral law and general types of human experience are presented in the fairy tale in the poetry of their images and although the child is aware only of the image at the time the truth enters with it and becomes a part of his individual experience to be recognised in its relations at a later stage every truth and type so given broadens and deepens the capacity of the child's inner life and adds an element to the store from which he draws his moral inferences the most familiar instance of a moral truth conveyed under a fairy story image is probably the story of the pure hearted and loving girl whose lips were touched with the wonderful power of dropping jewels with every spoken word while her stepsister whose heart was infested with malice and evil desires let ugly toads fall from her mouth whenever she spoke i mention the old tale because there is probably no one of my readers who has not heard it in childhood and because there are undoubtedly many to whose mind it has often recurred in later life as a sadly perfect presentment of the fact that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh that story has entered into the forming consciousness of many of us with its implications of the inevitable result of visible evil from evil in the heart and its revelation of the loathsomeness of evil itself and no less truly than this story has served to many as an embodiment of moral law has another household tale stood for a type of common experience how much the poorer should we be mentally without our early prophecy of the ugly ducklings we are to meet later in life those awkward offspring of our little human duckyard who are mostly well kicked and buffeted about for that very length of limb and breadth of back which needs must be to support swan's wings the story of the ugly duckling is much truer than many a bald statement of fact the english speaking world bears witness to its verity in constant use of the title as an identifying phrase it is the old story of the ugly duckling we say or he has turned out a real ugly duckling and we know that our hearers understand the whole situation the consideration of such familiar types and expressions as that of the ugly duckling suggests immediately another good reason for giving the child his due of fairy lore the reason is that to omit it is to deprive him of one important element in the full appreciation of mature literature if one thinks of it one sees that nearly all adult literature is made by people who in their beginnings were bred on the wonder tale whether he will or no the grown up author must incorporate into his work the tendencies memories kinds of feeling which were his in childhood the literature of maturity is naturally permeated by the influence of the literature of childhood sometimes it is apparent merely in the use of a name as suggestive of certain kinds of experience such are the recurrences of reference to the cinderella story sometimes it is an allusion which has its strength in long association of certain qualities with certain characters in fairydom like the slyness of brother fox and the cruelty of brother wolf sometimes the association of ideas lies below the surface drawing from the hidden wells of poetic illusion which are sunk in childhood the man or woman whose infancy was nourished exclusively on tales adapted from science made easy or from biographies of good men and great must remain blind to these beauties of literature he may look up the allusion or identify the reference but when that is done he is but richer by a fact or two there is no remembered thrill in it for him no savour in his memory no suggestion to his imagination and these are precisely the things which really count leaving out the fairy element is a loss to literary culture much as would be the omission of the bible or of shakespeare just as all adult literature is permeated by the influence of these familiar in youth so in less degree is it transfused with the subtle reminiscences of childhood's commerce with the wonder world to turn now from the inner to the outer aspects of the old time tale is to meet another cause of its value to children this is the value of its style simplicity directness and virility characterise the classic fairy tales and the most memorable relics of folklore and these are three of the very qualities which are most seriously lacking in much of the new writing for children and which are always necessary elements in the culture of taste fairy stories are not all well told but the best fairy stories are supremely well told and most folk tales have a movement a sweep and an unaffectedness which make them splendid foundations for taste in style for this and for poetic presentation of truths in easily assimilated form and because it gives joyous stimulus to the imagination and is necessary to full appreciation of adult literature we may freely use the wonder tale closely related to sometimes identical with the fairy tale is the old old source of children's love and laughter the nonsense tale under this head i wish to include all the merely funny tales of childhood embracing the cumulative stories like that of the old woman and the pig which would not go over the stile they all have a specific use and benefit and are worth the repetition children demand for them their value lies of course in the tonic and relaxing properties of humour nowhere is that property more welcome or needed than in the schoolroom it does us all good to laugh if there is no sneer nor smirch in the laugh fun sets the blood flowing more freely in the veins and loosens the strained cords of feeling and thought the delicious shock of surprise at every funny spot is a kind of electric treatment for the nerves but it especially does us good to laugh when we are children every little body is released from the conscious control school imposes on it and huddles into restful comfort or responds gaily to the joke more than this humour teaches children as it does their grown up brethren some of the facts and proportions of life what keener teacher is there than the kindly satire what more penetrating and suggestive than the humour of exaggerated statement of familiar tendency is there one of us who has not laughed himself out of some absurd complexity of over anxiety with a sudden recollection of clever alice and her fate in our household clever alice is an old _habituee_ and her timely arrival has saved many a situation which was twining itself about more ifs than it could comfortably support the wisdom which lies behind true humour is found in the nonsense tale of infancy as truly as in mature humour but in its own kind and degree just for fun is the first reason for the humorous story the wisdom in the fun is the second and now we come to the nature story no other type of fiction is more familiar to the teacher and probably no other kind is the source of so much uncertainty of feeling the nature story is much used as i have noticed above to illustrate or to teach the habits of animals and the laws of plant growth to stimulate scientific interest as well as to increase culture in scientific fact this is an entirely legitimate object in view of its present preponderance it is certainly a pity however that so few stories are available the accuracy of which from this point of view can be vouched for the carefully prepared book of to day is refuted and scoffed at to morrow the teacher who wishes to use story telling chiefly as an element in nature study must at least limit herself to a small amount of absolutely unquestioned material or else subject every new story to the judgment of an authority in the line dealt with this is not easy for the teacher at a distance from the great libraries and for those who have access to well equipped libraries it is a matter of time and thought it does not so greatly trouble the teacher who uses the nature story as a story rather than as a text book for she will not be so keenly attracted toward the books prepared with a didactic purpose she will find a good gift for the child in nature stories which are stories over and above any stimulus to his curiosity about fact that good gift is a certain possession of all good fiction one of the best things good fiction does for any of us is to broaden our comprehension of other lots than our own the average man or woman has little opportunity actually to live more than one kind of life the chances of birth occupation family ties determine for most of us a line of experience not very inclusive and but little varied and this is a natural barrier to our complete understanding of others whose life line is set at a different angle it is not possible wholly to sympathise with emotions engendered by experience which one has never had yet we all long to be broad in sympathy and inclusive in appreciation we long greatly to know the experience of others this yearning is probably one of the good but misconceived appetites so injudiciously fed by the gossip of the daily press there is a hope in the reader of getting for the moment into the lives of people who move in wholly different sets of circumstances but the relation of dry facts in newspapers however tinged with journalistic colour helps very little to enter such other life the entrance has to be by the door of the imagination and the journalist is rarely able to open it for us but there is a genius who can open it the author who can write fiction of the right sort can do it his is the gift of seeing inner realities and of showing them to those who cannot see them for themselves sharing the imaginative vision of the story writer we can truly follow out many other roads of life than our own the girl on a lone country farm is made to understand how a girl in a city sweating den feels and lives the london exquisite realises the life of a californian ranchman royalty and tenement dwellers become acquainted through the power of the imagination working on experience shown in the light of a human basis common to both fiction supplies an element of culture that of the sympathies which is invaluable and the beginnings of this culture this widening and clearing of the avenues of human sympathy are especially easily made with children in the nature story when you begin there was once a little furry rabbit 1 the child's curiosity is awakened by the very fact that the rabbit is not a child but something of a different species altogether now for something new and adventuresome says his expectation we are starting off into a foreign world he listens wide eyed while you say and he lived in a warm cosy nest down under the long grass with his mother how delightful to live in a place like that so different from little boys homes his name was raggylug and his mother's name was molly cottontail and every morning when molly cottontail went out to get their food she said to raggylug now raggylug remember you are only a baby rabbit and don't move from the nest no matter what you hear no matter what you see don't you move all this is different still yet it is familiar too it appears that rabbits are rather like folks so the tale proceeds and the little furry rabbit passes through experiences strange to little boys yet very like little boys adventures in some respects he is frightened by a snake comforted by his mammy and taken to a new house under the long grass a long way off these are all situations to which the child has a key there is just enough of strangeness to entice just enough of the familiar to relieve any strain when the child has lived through the day's happenings with raggylug the latter has begun to seem veritably a little brother of the grass to him and because he has entered imaginatively into the feelings and fate of a creature different from himself he has taken his first step out into the wide world of the lives of others footnote 1 see _raggylug_ page 135 it may be a recognition of this factor and its value which has led so many writers of nature stories into the error of over humanising their four footed or feathered heroes and heroines the exaggeration is unnecessary for there is enough community of lot suggested in the sternest scientific record to constitute a natural basis for sympathy on the part of the human animal without any falsity of presentation whatever the nature story may be counted on as a help in the beginnings of culture of the sympathies it is not of course a help confined to the powers of the nature story all types of story share in some degree the powers of each but each has some especial virtue in dominant degree and the nature story is on this ground identified with the thought given the nature story shares its influence especially with the historical story as the one widens the circle of connection with other kinds of life the other deepens the sense of relation to past lives it gives the sense of background of the close and endless connection of generation with generation a good historical story vitalises the conception of past events and brings their characters into relation with the present this is especially true of stories of things and persons in the history of our own race they foster race consciousness the feeling of kinship and community of blood it is this property which makes the historical story so good an agent for furthering a proper national pride in children genuine patriotism neither arrogant nor melodramatic is so generally recognised as having its roots in early training that i need not dwell on this possibility further than to note its connection with the instinct of hero worship which is quick in the healthy child let us feed that hunger for the heroic which gnaws at the imagination of every boy and of more girls than is generally admitted there have been heroes in plenty in the world's records heroes of action of endurance of decision of faith biographical history is full of them and the deeds of these heroes are every one a story we tell these stories both to bring the great past into its due relation with the living present and to arouse that generous admiration and desire for emulation which is the source of so much inspiration in childhood when these stories are tales of the doings and happenings of our own heroes the strong men and women whose lives are a part of our own country's history they serve the double demands of hero worship and patriotism stories of wise and honest statesmanship of struggle with primitive conditions of generous love and sacrifice and in some measure of physical courage form a subtle and powerful influence for pride in one's people the intimate sense of kinship with one's own nation and the desire to serve it in one's own time it is not particularly useful to tell batches of unrelated anecdote it is much more profitable to take up the story of a period and connect it with a group of interesting persons whose lives affected it or were affected by it telling the stories of their lives or of the events in which they were concerned as true stories these biographical stories must usually be adapted for use but besides these there is a certain number of pure stories works of art which already exist for us and which illuminate facts and epochs almost without need of sidelights such may stand by themselves or be used with only enough explanation to give background probably the best story of this kind known to lovers of modern literature is daudet's famous _la derniere classe_ 1 footnote 1 see _the last lesson_ page 238 the historical story to recapitulate gives a sense of the reality and humanness of past events is a valuable aid in patriotic training and stirs the desire of emulating goodness and wisdom chapter ii selection of stories to tell there is one picture which i can always review in my own collection of past scenes though many a more highly coloured one has been irrevocably curtained by the folds of forgetfulness it is the picture of a little girl standing by an old fashioned marble topped dressing table in a pink sunny room i can never see the little girl's face because somehow i am always looking down at her short skirts or twisting my head round against the hand which patiently combs her stubborn curls but i can see the brushes and combs on the marble table quite plainly and the pinker streaks of sun on the pink walls and i can hear i can hear a low wonder working voice which goes smoothly on and on as the fingers run up the little girl's locks or stroke the hair into place on her forehead the voice says and little goldilocks came to a little bit of a house and she opened the door and went in it was the house where three bears lived there was a great bear a little bear and a middle sized bear and they had gone out for a walk goldilocks went in and she saw the little girl is very still she would not disturb that story by so much as a loud breath but presently the comb comes to a tangle pulls and the little girl begins to squirm instantly the voice becomes impressive mysterious she went up to the table and there were _three plates of porridge_ she tasted the first one the little girl swallows the breath she was going to whimper with and waits and it was too hot she tasted the next one and _that_ was too hot then she tasted the little bit of a plate and that was just right how i remember the delightful sense of achievement which stole into the little girl's veins when the voice behind her said just right i think she always chuckled a little and hugged her stomach so the story progressed and the little girl got through her toilet without crying owing to the wonder working voice and its marvellous adaptation of climaxes to emergencies nine times out of ten it was the story of _the three bears_ she demanded when with the appearance of brush and comb the voice asked which story shall mother tell it was a memory of the little girl in the pink room which made it easy for me to understand some other children's preferences when i recently had occasion to inquire about them by asking many individual children which story of all they had heard they liked best by taking votes on the best story of a series after telling it and by getting some obliging teachers to put similar questions to their pupils i found three prime favourites common to a great many children of about the kindergarten age they were _the three bears_ _three little pigs_ and _the little pig that wouldn't go over the stile_ some of the teachers were genuinely disturbed because the few stories they had introduced merely for amusement had taken so pre eminent a place in the children's affection over those which had been given seriously it was of no use however to suggest substitutes the children knew definitely what they liked and though they accepted the recapitulation of scientific and moral stories with polite approbation they returned to the original answer at a repetition of the question inasmuch as the slightest of the things we hope to do for children by means of stories is quite impossible unless the children enjoy the stories it may be worth our while to consider seriously these three which they surely do enjoy to see what common qualities are in them explanatory of their popularity by which we may test the probable success of other stories we wish to tell here they are three prime favourites of proved standing the story of the three little pigs 1 footnote 1 adapted from joseph jacobs's _english fairy tales_ david nutt 57 59 long acre w.c 6s once upon a time there were three little pigs who went from home to seek their fortune the first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw and said to him good man give me that straw to build me a house the man gave the straw and the little pig built his house with it presently came along a wolf and knocked at the door and said little pig little pig let me come in but the pig answered no no by the hair of my chiny chin chin so the wolf said then i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house in so he huffed and he puffed and he blew his house in and ate up the little pig the second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze and said good man give me that furze to build me a house the man gave the furze and the pig built his house then once more came the wolf and said little pig little pig let me come in no no by the hair of my chiny chin chin then i'll puff and i'll huff and i'll blow your house in so he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and he huffed and at last he blew the house in and ate up the little pig the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks and said good man give me those bricks to build me a house with the man gave the bricks and he built his house with them again the wolf came and said little pig little pig let me come in no no by the hair of my chiny chin chin then i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house in so he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and huffed but he could not get the house down finding that he could not with all his huffing and puffing blow the house down he said little pig i know where there is a nice field of turnips where said the little pig oh in mr smith's field and if you will be ready to morrow morning we will go together and get some for dinner very well said the little pig what time do you mean to go oh at six o'clock so the little pig got up at five and got the turnips before the wolf came crying little pig are you ready the little pig said ready i have been and come back again and got a nice potful for dinner the wolf felt very angry at this but thought that he would be a match for the little pig somehow or other so he said little pig i know where there is a nice apple tree where said the pig down at merry garden replied the wolf and if you will not deceive me i will come for you at five o'clock to morrow and get some apples the little pig got up next morning at four o'clock and went off for the apples hoping to get back before the wolf came but it took long to climb the tree and just as he was coming down from it he saw the wolf coming when the wolf came up he said little pig what are you here before me are they nice apples yes very said the little pig i will throw you down one and he threw it so far that while the wolf was gone to pick it up the little pig jumped down and ran home the next day the wolf came again and said to the little pig little pig there is a fair in town this afternoon will you go oh yes said the pig i will go what time at three said the wolf as usual the little pig went off before the time and got to the fair and bought a butter churn which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming so he got into the churn to hide and in so doing turned it round and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair he went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill then the little pig said ha ha i frightened you then then the wolf was very angry indeed and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig when the little pig saw what he was about he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire and just as the wolf was coming down he took off the cover and in fell the wolf quickly the little pig clapped on the cover and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper the story of the three bears 1 footnote 1 adapted from joseph jacobs's _english fairy tales_ david nutt 57 59 long acre w.c 6s once upon a time there were three bears who lived together in a house of their own in a wood one of them was a little small wee bear and one was a middle sized bear and the other was a great huge bear they had
