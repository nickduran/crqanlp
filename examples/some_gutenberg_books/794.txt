"1" "be good i am not sure whether we kept this resolution or not oswald thinks now that perhaps we made a mistake in trying so very hard to be good all at once you should do everything by degrees p.s it turned out daisy was not really dead at all it was only fainting so like a girl n.b pincher was found on the drawing room sofa appendix i have not told you half the things we did for the jungle for instance about the elephants tusks and the horse hair sofa cushions and uncle's fishing boots chapter 2 the wouldbegoods when we were sent down into the country to learn to be good we felt it was rather good business because we knew our being sent there was really only to get us out of the way for a little while and we knew right enough that it wasn't a punishment though mrs blake said it was because we had been punished thoroughly for taking the stuffed animals out and making a jungle on the lawn with them and the garden hose and you cannot be punished twice for the same offence this is the english law at least i think so and at any rate no one would punish you three times and we had had the malacca cane and the solitary confinement and the uncle had kindly explained to us that all ill feeling between him and us was wiped out entirely by the bread and water we had endured and what with the bread and water and being prisoners and not being able to tame any mice in our prisons i quite feel that we had suffered it up thoroughly and now we could start fair i think myself that descriptions of places are generally dull but i have sometimes thought that was because the authors do not tell you what you truly want to know however dull or not here goes because you won't understand anything unless i tell you what the place was like the moat house was the one we went to stay at there has been a house there since saxon times it is a manor and a manor goes on having a house on it whatever happens the moat house was burnt down once or twice in ancient centuries i don't remember which but they always built a new one and cromwell's soldiers smashed it about but it was patched up again it is a very odd house the front door opens straight into the dining room and there are red curtains and a black and white marble floor like a chess board and there is a secret staircase only it is not secret now only rather rickety it is not very big but there is a watery moat all round it with a brick bridge that leads to the front door then on the other side of the moat there is the farm with barns and oast houses and stables or things like that and the other way the garden lawn goes on till it comes to the churchyard the churchyard is not divided from the garden at all except by a little grass bank in the front of the house there is more garden and the big fruit garden is at the back the man the house belongs to likes new houses so he built a big one with conservatories and a stable with a clock in a turret on the top and he left the moat house and albert's uncle took it and my father was to come down sometimes from saturday to monday and albert's uncle was to live with us all the time and he would be writing a book and we were not to bother him but he would give an eye to us i hope all this is plain i have said it as short as i can we got down rather late but there was still light enough to see the big bell hanging at the top of the house the rope belonging to it went right down the house through our bedroom to the dining room h o saw the rope and pulled it while he was washing his hands for supper and dicky and i let him and the bell tolled solemnly father shouted to him not to and we went down to supper but presently there were many feet trampling on the gravel and father went out to see when he came back he said the whole village or half of it has come up to see why the bell rang it's only rung for fire or burglars why can't you kids let things alone albert's uncle said bed follows supper as the fruit follows the flower they'll do no more mischief to night sir to morrow i will point out a few of the things to be avoided in this bucolic retreat so it was bed directly after supper and that was why we did not see much that night but in the morning we were all up rather early and we seemed to have awakened in a new world rich in surprises beyond the dreams of anybody as it says in the quotation we went everywhere we could in the time but when it was breakfast time we felt we had not seen half or a quarter the room we had breakfast in was exactly like in a story black oak panels and china in corner cupboards with glass doors these doors were locked there were green curtains and honeycomb for breakfast after brekker my father went back to town and albert's uncle went too to see publishers we saw them to the station and father gave us a long list of what we weren't to do it began with don't pull ropes unless you're quite sure what will happen at the other end and it finished with for goodness sake try to keep out of mischief till i come down on saturday there were lots of other things in between we all promised we would and we saw them off and waved till the train was quite out of sight then we started to walk home daisy was tired so oswald carried her home on his back when we got home she said i do like you oswald she is not a bad little kid and oswald felt it was his duty to be nice to her because she was a visitor then we looked all over everything it was a glorious place you did not know where to begin we were all a little tired before we found the hayloft but we pulled ourselves together to make a fort with the trusses of hay great square things and we were having a jolly good time all of us when suddenly a trap door opened and a head bobbed up with a straw in its mouth we knew nothing about the country then and the head really did scare us rather though of course we found out directly that the feet belonging to it were standing on the bar of the loose box underneath the head said don't you let the governor catch you a spoiling of that there hay that's all and it spoke thickly because of the straw it is strange to think how ignorant you were in the past we can hardly believe now that once we really did not know that it spoiled hay to mess about with it horses don't like to eat it afterwards always remember this when the head had explained a little more it went away and we turned the handle of the chaff cutting machine and nobody got hurt though the head had said we should cut our fingers off if we touched it and then we sat down on the floor which is dirty with the nice clean dirt that is more than half chopped hay and those there was room for hung their legs down out of the top door and we looked down at the farmyard which is very slushy when you get down into it but most interesting then alice said now we're all here and the boys are tired enough to sit still for a minute i want to have a council we said what about and she said i'll tell you h o don't wriggle so sit on my frock if the straws tickle your legs you see he wears socks and so he can never be quite as comfortable as anyone else promise not to laugh alice said getting very red and looking at dora who got red too we did and then she said dora and i have talked this over and daisy too and we have written it down because it is easier than saying it shall i read it or will you dora dora said it didn't matter alice might so alice read it and though she gabbled a bit we all heard it i copied it afterwards this is what she read new society for being good in i dora bastable and alice bastable my sister being of sound mind and body when we were shut up with bread and water on that jungle day we thought a great deal about our naughty sins and we made our minds up to be good for ever after and we talked to daisy about it and she had an idea so we want to start a society for being good in it is daisy's idea but we think so too you know dora interrupted when people want to do good things they always make a society there are thousands there's the missionary society yes alice said and the society for the prevention of something or other and the young men's mutual improvement society and the s.p.g what's s.p.g oswald asked society for the propagation of the jews of course said noel who cannot always spell no it isn't but do let me go on alice did go on we propose to get up a society with a chairman and a treasurer and secretary and keep a journal book saying what we've done if that doesn't make us good it won't be my fault the aim of the society is nobleness and goodness and great and unselfish deeds we wish not to be such a nuisance to grown up people and to perform prodigies of real goodness we wish to spread our wings here alice read very fast she told me afterwards daisy had helped her with that part and she thought when she came to the wings they sounded rather silly to spread our wings and rise above the kind of interesting things that you ought not to do but to do kindnesses to all however low and mean denny was listening carefully now he nodded three or four times little words of kindness he said little deeds of love make this earth an eagle like the one above this did not sound right but we let it pass because an eagle does have wings and we wanted to hear the rest of what the girls had written but there was no rest that's all said alice and daisy said don't you think it's a good idea that depends oswald answered who is president and what you mean by being good oswald did not care very much for the idea himself because being good is not the sort of thing he thinks it is proper to talk about especially before strangers but the girls and denny seemed to like it so oswald did not say exactly what he thought especially as it was daisy's idea this was true politeness i think it would be nice noel said if we made it a sort of play let's do the pilgrim's progress we talked about that for some time but it did not come to anything because we all wanted to be mr greatheart except h o who wanted to be the lions and you could not have lions in a society for goodness dicky said he did not wish to play if it meant reading books about children who die he really felt just as oswald did about it he told me afterwards but the girls were looking as if they were in sunday school and we did not wish to be unkind at last oswald said well let's draw up the rules of the society and choose the president and settle the name dora said oswald should be president and he modestly consented she was secretary and denny treasurer if we ever had any money making the rules took us all the afternoon they were these rules 1 every member is to be as good as possible 2 there is to be no more jaw than necessary about being good oswald and dicky put that rule in 3 no day must pass without our doing some kind action to a suffering fellow creature 4 we are to meet every day or as often as we like 5 we are to do good to people we don't like as often as we can 6 no one is to leave the society without the consent of all the rest of us 7 the society is to be kept a profound secret from all the world except us 8 the name of our society is and when we got as far as that we all began to talk at once dora wanted it called the society for humane improvement denny said the society for reformed outcast children but dicky said no we really were not so bad as all that then h o said call it the good society or the society for being good in said daisy or the society of goods said noel that's priggish said oswald besides we don't know whether we shall be so very you see alice explained we only said if we could we would be good well then dicky said getting up and beginning to dust the chopped hay off himself call it the society of the wouldbegoods and have done with it oswald thinks dicky was getting sick of it and wanted to make himself a little disagreeable if so he was doomed to disappointment for everyone else clapped hands and called out that's the very thing then the girls went off to write out the rules and took h o with them and noel went to write some poetry to put in the minute book that's what you call the book that a society's secretary writes what it does in denny went with him to help he knows a lot of poetry i think he went to a lady's school where they taught nothing but that he was rather shy of us but he took to noel i can't think why dicky and oswald walked round the garden and told each other what they thought of the new society i'm not sure we oughtn't to have put our foot down at the beginning dicky said i don't see much in it anyhow it pleases the girls oswald said for he is a kind brother but we're not going to stand jaw and words in season and loving sisterly warnings i tell you what it is oswald we'll have to run this thing our way or it'll be jolly beastly for everybody oswald saw this plainly we must do something dicky said it's very very hard though still there must be some interesting things that are not wrong i suppose so oswald said but being good is so much like being a muff generally anyhow i'm not going to smooth the pillows of the sick or read to the aged poor or any rot out of ministering children no more am i dicky said he was chewing a straw like the head had in its mouth but i suppose we must play the game fair let's begin by looking out for something useful to do something like mending things or cleaning them not just showing off the boys in books chop kindling wood and save their pennies to buy tea and tracts little beasts said dick i say let's talk about something else and oswald was glad to for he was beginning to feel jolly uncomfortable we were all rather quiet at tea and afterwards oswald played draughts with daisy and the others yawned i don't know when we've had such a gloomy evening and everyone was horribly polite and said please and thank you far more than requisite albert's uncle came home after tea he was jolly and told us stories but he noticed us being a little dull and asked what blight had fallen on our young lives oswald could have answered and said it is the society of the wouldbegoods that is the blight but of course he didn't and albert's uncle said no more but he went up and kissed the girls when they were in bed and asked them if there was anything wrong and they told him no on their honour the next morning oswald awoke early the refreshing beams of the morning sun shone on his narrow white bed and on the sleeping forms of his dear little brothers and denny who had got the pillow on top of his head and was snoring like a kettle when it sings oswald could not remember at first what was the matter with him and then he remembered the wouldbegoods and wished he hadn't he felt at first as if there was nothing you could do and even hesitated to buzz a pillow at denny's head but he soon saw that this could not be so he chucked his boot and caught denny right in the waistcoat part and thus the day began more brightly than he had expected oswald had not done anything out of the way good the night before except that when no one was looking he polished the brass candlestick in the girls bedroom with one of his socks and he might just as well have let it alone for the servants cleaned it again with the other things in the morning and he could never find the sock afterwards there were two servants one of them had to be called mrs pettigrew instead of jane and eliza like others she was cook and managed things after breakfast albert's uncle said i now seek the retirement of my study at your peril violate my privacy before 1.30 sharp nothing short of bloodshed will warrant the intrusion and nothing short of man or rather boy slaughter shall avenge it so we knew he wanted to be quiet and the girls decided that we ought to play out of doors so as not to disturb him we should have played out of doors anyhow on a jolly fine day like that but as we were going out dicky said to oswald i say come along here a minute will you so oswald came along and dicky took him into the other parlour and shut the door and oswald said well spit it out what is it he knows that is vulgar and he would not have said it to anyone but his own brother dicky said it's a pretty fair nuisance i told you how it would be and oswald was patient with him and said what is don't be all day about it dicky fidgeted about a bit and then he said well i did as i said i looked about for something useful to do and you know that dairy window that wouldn't open only a little bit like that well i mended the catch with wire and whip cord and it opened wide and i suppose they didn't want it mended said oswald he knew but too well that grown up people sometimes like to keep things far different from what we would and you catch it if you try to do otherwise i shouldn't have minded that dicky said because i could easily have taken it all off again if they'd only said so but the sillies went and propped up a milk pan against the window they never took the trouble to notice i had mended it so the wretched thing pushed the window open all by itself directly they propped it up and it tumbled through into the moat and they are most awfully waxy all the men are out in the fields and they haven't any spare milk pans if i were a farmer i must say i wouldn't stick at an extra milk pan or two accidents must happen sometimes i call it mean dicky spoke in savage tones but oswald was not so unhappy first because it wasn't his fault and next because he is a far seeing boy never mind he said kindly keep your tail up we'll get the beastly milk pan out all right come on he rushed hastily to the garden and gave a low signifying whistle which the others know well enough to mean something extra being up and when they were all gathered round him he spoke fellow countrymen he said we're going to have a rousing good time it's nothing naughty is it daisy asked like the last time you had that was rousingly good alice said shish and oswald pretended not to hear a precious treasure he said has inadvertently been laid low in the moat by one of us the rotten thing tumbled in by itself dicky said oswald waved his hand and said anyhow it's there it's our duty to restore it to its sorrowing owners i say look here we're going to drag the moat everyone brightened up at this it was our duty and it was interesting too this is very uncommon so we went out to where the orchard is at the other side of the moat there were gooseberries and things on the bushes but we did not take any till we had asked if we might alice went and asked mrs pettigrew said law i suppose so you'd eat em anyhow leave or no leave she little knows the honourable nature of the house of bastable but she has much to learn the orchard slopes gently down to the dark waters of the moat we sat there in the sun and talked about dragging the moat till denny said how do you drag moats and we were speechless because though we had read many times about a moat being dragged for missing heirs and lost wills we really had never thought about exactly how it was done grappling irons are right i believe denny said but i don't suppose they'd have any at the farm and we asked and found they had never even heard of them i think myself he meant some other word but he was quite positive so then we got a sheet off oswald's bed and we all took our shoes and stockings off and we tried to see if the sheet would drag the bottom of the moat which is shallow at that end but it would keep floating on the top of the water and when we tried sewing stones into one end of it it stuck on something in the bottom and when we got it up it was torn we were very sorry and the sheet was in an awful mess but the girls said they were sure they could wash it in the basin in their room and we thought as we had torn it anyway we might as well go on that washing never came off no human being noel said knows half the treasures hidden in this dark tarn and we decided we would drag a bit more at that end and work gradually round to under the dairy window where the milk pan was we could not see that part very well because of the bushes that grow between the cracks of the stones where the house goes down into the moat and opposite the dairy window the barn goes straight down into the moat too it is like pictures of venice but you cannot get opposite the dairy window anyhow we got the sheet down again when we had tied the torn parts together in a bunch with string and oswald was just saying now then my hearties pull together pull with a will one two three when suddenly dora dropped her bit of the sheet with a piercing shriek and cried out oh it's all wormy at the bottom i felt them wriggle and she was out of the water almost before the words were out of her mouth the other girls all scuttled out too and they let the sheet go in such a hurry that we had no time to steady ourselves and one of us went right in and the rest got wet up to our waistbands the one who went right in was only h o but dora made an awful fuss and said it was our fault we told her what we thought and it ended in the girls going in with h o to change his things we had some more gooseberries while they were gone dora was in an awful wax when she went away but she is not of a sullen disposition though sometimes hasty and when they all came back we saw it was all right so we said what shall we do now alice said i don't think we need drag any more it is wormy i felt it when dora did and besides the milk pan is sticking a bit of itself out of the water i saw it through the dairy window couldn't we get it up with fish hooks noel said but alice explained that the dairy was now locked up and the key taken out so then oswald said look here we'll make a raft we should have to do it some time and we might as well do it now i saw an old door in that corner stable that they don't use you know the one where they chop the wood we got the door we had never made a raft any of us but the way to make rafts is better described in books so we knew what to do we found some nice little tubs stuck up on the fence of the farm garden and nobody seemed to want them for anything just then so we took them denny had a box of tools someone had given him for his last birthday they were rather rotten little things but the gimlet worked all right so we managed to make holes in the edges of the tubs and fasten them with string under the four corners of the old door this took us a long time albert's uncle asked us at dinner what we had been playing at and we said it was a secret and it was nothing wrong you see we wished to atone for dicky's mistake before anything more was said the house has no windows in the side that faces the orchard the rays of the afternoon sun were beaming along the orchard grass when at last we launched the raft she floated out beyond reach with the last shove of the launching but oswald waded out and towed her back he is not afraid of worms yet if he had known of the other things that were in the bottom of that moat he would have kept his boots on so would the others especially dora as you will see at last the gallant craft rode upon the waves we manned her though not up to our full strength because if more than four got on the water came up too near our knees and we feared she might founder if over manned daisy and denny did not want to go on the raft white mice that they were so that was all right and as h o had been wet through once he was not very keen alice promised noel her best paint brush if he'd give up and not go because we knew well that the voyage was fraught with deep dangers though the exact danger that lay in wait for us under the dairy window we never even thought of so we four elder ones got on the raft very carefully and even then every time we moved the water swished up over the raft and hid our feet but i must say it was a jolly decent raft dicky was captain because it was his adventure we had hop poles from the hop garden beyond the orchard to punt with we made the girls stand together in the middle and hold on to each other to keep steady then we christened our gallant vessel we called it the richard after dicky and also after the splendid admiral who used to eat wine glasses and died after the battle of the revenge in tennyson's poetry then those on shore waved a fond adieu as well as they could with the dampness of their handkerchiefs which we had had to use to dry our legs and feet when we put on our stockings for dinner and slowly and stately the good ship moved away from shore riding on the waves as though they were her native element we kept her going with the hop poles and we kept her steady in the same way but we could not always keep her steady enough and we could not always keep her in the wind's eye that is to say she went where we did not want and once she bumped her corner against the barn wall and all the crew had to sit down suddenly to avoid"
