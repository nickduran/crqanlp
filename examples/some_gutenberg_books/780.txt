"1" "he said there isn't a big power in europe or asia or america or africa that hasn't got at least one or two flying machines hidden up its sleeve at the present time not one real workable flying machines and the spying the spying and manoeuvring to find out what the others have got i tell you sir a foreigner or for the matter of that an unaccredited native can't get within four miles of lydd nowadays not to mention our little circus at aldershot and the experimental camp in galway no well said bert i'd like to see one of them anyhow jest to help believing i'll believe when i see that i'll promise you you'll see em fast enough said the soldier and led his machine out into the road he left bert on his wall grave and pensive with his cap on the back of his head and a cigarette smouldering in the corner of his mouth if what he says is true said bert me and grubb we been wasting our blessed old time besides incurring expense with that green ouse 5 it was while this mysterious talk with the soldier still stirred in bert smallways imagination that the most astounding incident in the whole of that dramatic chapter of human history the coming of flying occurred people talk glibly enough of epoch making events this was an epoch making event it was the unanticipated and entirely successful flight of mr alfred butteridge from the crystal palace to glasgow and back in a small businesslike looking machine heavier than air an entirely manageable and controllable machine that could fly as well as a pigeon it wasn't one felt a fresh step forward in the matter so much as a giant stride a leap mr butteridge remained in the air altogether for about nine hours and during that time he flew with the ease and assurance of a bird his machine was however neither bird like nor butterfly like nor had it the wide lateral expansion of the ordinary aeroplane the effect upon the observer was rather something in the nature of a bee or wasp parts of the apparatus were spinning very rapidly and gave one a hazy effect of transparent wings but parts including two peculiarly curved wing cases if one may borrow a figure from the flying beetles remained expanded stiffly in the middle was a long rounded body like the body of a moth and on this mr butteridge could be seen sitting astride much as a man bestrides a horse the wasp like resemblance was increased by the fact that the apparatus flew with a deep booming hum exactly the sound made by a wasp at a windowpane mr butteridge took the world by surprise he was one of those gentlemen from nowhere fate still succeeds in producing for the stimulation of mankind he came it was variously said from australia and america and the south of france he was also described quite incorrectly as the son of a man who had amassed a comfortable fortune in the manufacture of gold nibs and the butteridge fountain pens but this was an entirely different strain of butteridges for some years in spite of a loud voice a large presence an aggressive swagger and an implacable manner he had been an undistinguished member of most of the existing aeronautical associations then one day he wrote to all the london papers to announce that he had made arrangements for an ascent from the crystal palace of a machine that would demonstrate satisfactorily that the outstanding difficulties in the way of flying were finally solved few of the papers printed his letter still fewer were the people who believed in his claim no one was excited even when a fracas on the steps of a leading hotel in piccadilly in which he tried to horse whip a prominent german musician upon some personal account delayed his promised ascent the quarrel was inadequately reported and his name spelt variously betteridge and betridge until his flight indeed he did not and could not contrive to exist in the public mind there were scarcely thirty people on the look out for him in spite of all his clamour when about six o'clock one summer morning the doors of the big shed in which he had been putting together his apparatus opened it was near the big model of a megatherium in the crystal palace grounds and his giant insect came droning out into a negligent and incredulous world but before he had made his second circuit of the crystal palace towers fame was lifting her trumpet she drew a deep breath as the startled tramps who sleep on the seats of trafalgar square were roused by his buzz and awoke to discover him circling the nelson column and by the time he had got to birmingham which place he crossed about half past ten her deafening blast was echoing throughout the country the despaired of thing was done a man was flying securely and well scotland was agape for his coming glasgow he reached by one o'clock and it is related that scarcely a ship yard or factory in that busy hive of industry resumed work before half past two the public mind was just sufficiently educated in the impossibility of flying to appreciate mr butteridge at his proper value he circled the university buildings and dropped to within shouting distance of the crowds in west end park and on the slope of gilmorehill the thing flew quite steadily at a pace of about three miles an hour in a wide circle making a deep hum that would have drowned his full rich voice completely had he not provided himself with a megaphone he avoided churches buildings and mono rail cables with consummate ease as he conversed me name's butteridge he shouted b u t t e r i d g e got it me mother was scotch and having assured himself that he had been understood he rose amidst cheers and shouting and patriotic cries and then flew up very swiftly and easily into the south eastern sky rising and falling with long easy undulations in an extraordinarily wasp like manner his return to london he visited and hovered over manchester and liverpool and oxford on his way and spelt his name out to each place was an occasion of unparalleled excitement every one was staring heavenward more people were run over in the streets upon that one day than in the previous three months and a county council steamboat the isaac walton collided with a pier of westminster bridge and narrowly escaped disaster by running ashore it was low water on the mud on the south side he returned to the crystal palace grounds that classic starting point of aeronautical adventure about sunset re entered his shed without disaster and had the doors locked immediately upon the photographers and journalists who been waiting his return look here you chaps he said as his assistant did so i'm tired to death and saddle sore i can't give you a word of talk i'm too done my name's butteridge b u t t e r i d g e get that right i'm an imperial englishman i'll talk to you all to morrow foggy snapshots still survive to record that incident his assistant struggles in a sea of aggressive young men carrying note books or upholding cameras and wearing bowler hats and enterprising ties he himself towers up in the doorway a big figure with a mouth an eloquent cavity beneath a vast black moustache distorted by his shout to these relentless agents of publicity he towers there the most famous man in the country almost symbolically he holds and gesticulates with a megaphone in his left hand 6 tom and bert smallways both saw that return they watched from the crest of bun hill from which they had so often surveyed the pyrotechnics of the crystal palace bert was excited tom kept calm and lumpish but neither of them realised how their own lives were to be invaded by the fruits of that beginning p'raps old grubb'll mind the shop a bit now he said and put his blessed model in the fire not that that can save us if we don't tide over with steinhart's account bert knew enough of things and the problem of aeronautics to realise that this gigantic imitation of a bee would to use his own idiom give the newspapers fits the next day it was clear the fits had been given even as he said their magazine pages were black with hasty photographs their prose was convulsive they foamed at the headline the next day they were worse before the week was out they were not so much published as carried screaming into the street the dominant fact in the uproar was the exceptional personality of mr butteridge and the extraordinary terms he demanded for the secret of his machine for it was a secret and he kept it secret in the most elaborate fashion he built his apparatus himself in the safe privacy of the great crystal palace sheds with the assistance of inattentive workmen and the day next following his flight he took it to pieces single handed packed certain portions and then secured unintelligent assistance in packing and dispersing the rest sealed packing cases went north and east and west to various pantechnicons and the engines were boxed with peculiar care it became evident these precautions were not inadvisable in view of the violent demand for any sort of photograph or impressions of his machine but mr butteridge having once made his demonstration intended to keep his secret safe from any further risk of leakage he faced the british public now with the question whether they wanted his secret or not he was he said perpetually an imperial englishman and his first wish and his last was to see his invention the privilege and monopoly of the empire only it was there the difficulty began mr butteridge it became evident was a man singularly free from any false modesty indeed from any modesty of any kind singularly willing to see interviewers answer questions upon any topic except aeronautics volunteer opinions criticisms and autobiography supply portraits and photographs of himself and generally spread his personality across the terrestrial sky the published portraits insisted primarily upon an immense black moustache and secondarily upon a fierceness behind the moustache the general impression upon the public was that butteridge was a small man no one big it was felt could have so virulently aggressive an expression though as a matter of fact butteridge had a height of six feet two inches and a weight altogether proportionate to that moreover he had a love affair of large and unusual dimensions and irregular circumstances and the still largely decorous british public learnt with reluctance and alarm that a sympathetic treatment of this affair was inseparable from the exclusive acquisition of the priceless secret of aerial stability by the british empire the exact particulars of the similarity never came to light but apparently the lady had in a fit of high minded inadvertence had gone through the ceremony of marriage with one quotes the unpublished discourse of mr butteridge a white livered skunk and this zoological aberration did in some legal and vexatious manner mar her social happiness he wanted to talk about the business to show the splendour of her nature in the light of its complications it was really most embarrassing to a press that has always possessed a considerable turn for reticence that wanted things personal indeed in the modern fashion yet not too personal it was embarrassing i say to be inexorably confronted with mr butteridge's great heart to see it laid open in relentlesss self vivisection and its pulsating dissepiments adorned with emphatic flag labels confronted they were and there was no getting away from it he would make this appalling viscus beat and throb before the shrinking journalists no uncle with a big watch and a little baby ever harped upon it so relentlessly whatever evasion they attempted he set aside he gloried in his love he said and compelled them to write it down that's of course a private affair mr butteridge they would object the injustice sorr is public i do not care either i am up against institutions or individuals i do not care if i am up against the universal all i am pleading the cause of a woman a woman i lurve sorr a noble woman misunderstood i intend to vindicate her sorr to the four winds of heaven i lurve england he used to say lurve england but puritanism sorr i abhor it fills me with loathing it raises my gorge take my own case he insisted relentlessly upon his heart and upon seeing proofs of the interview if they had not done justice to his erotic bellowings and gesticulations he stuck in in a large inky scrawl all and more than they had omitted it was a strangely embarrassing thing for british journalism never was there a more obvious or uninteresting affair never had the world heard the story of erratic affection with less appetite or sympathy on the other hand it was extremely curious about mr butteridge's invention but when mr butteridge could be deflected for a moment from the cause of the lady he championed then he talked chiefly and usually with tears of tenderness in his voice about his mother and his childhood his mother who crowned a complete encyclopedia of maternal virtue by being largely scotch she was not quite neat but nearly so i owe everything in me to me mother he asserted everything eh and ask any man who's done anything you'll hear the same story all we have we owe to women they are the species sorr man is but a dream he comes and goes the woman's soul leadeth us upward and on he was always going on like that what in particular he wanted from the government for his secret did not appear nor what beyond a money payment could be expected from a modern state in such an affair the general effect upon judicious observers indeed was not that he was treating for anything but that he was using an unexampled opportunity to bellow and show off to an attentive world rumours of his real identity spread abroad it was said that he had been the landlord of an ambiguous hotel in cape town and had there given shelter to and witnessed the experiments and finally stolen the papers and plans of an extremely shy and friendless young inventor named palliser who had come to south africa from england in an advanced stage of consumption and died there this at any rate was the allegation of the more outspoken american press but the proof or disproof of that never reached the public mr butteridge also involved himself passionately in a tangle of disputes for the possession of a great number of valuable money prizes some of these had been offered so long ago as 1906 for successful mechanical flight by the time of mr butteridge's success a really very considerable number of newspapers tempted by the impunity of the pioneers in this direction had pledged themselves to pay in some cases quite overwhelming sums to the first person to fly from manchester to glasgow from london to manchester one hundred miles two hundred miles in england and the like most had hedged a little with ambiguous conditions and now offered resistance one or two paid at once and vehemently called attention to the fact and mr butteridge plunged into litigation with the more recalcitrant while at the same time sustaining a vigorous agitation and canvass to induce the government to purchase his invention one fact however remained permanent throughout all the developments of this affair behind butteridge's preposterous love interest his politics and personality and all his shouting and boasting and that was that so far as the mass of people knew he was in sole possession of the secret of the practicable aeroplane in which for all one could tell to the contrary the key of the future empire of the world resided and presently to the great consternation of innumerable people including among others mr bert smallways it became apparent that whatever negotiations were in progress for the acquisition of this precious secret by the british government were in danger of falling through the london daily requiem first voiced the universal alarm and published an interview under the terrific caption of mr butteridge speaks his mind therein the inventor if he was an inventor poured out his heart i came from the end of the earth he said which rather seemed to confirm the cape town story bringing me motherland the secret that would give her the empire of the world and what do i get he paused i am sniffed at by elderly mandarins and the woman i love is treated like a leper i am an imperial englishman he went on in a splendid outburst subsequently written into the interview by his own hand but there there are limits to the human heart there are younger nations living nations nations that do not snore and gurgle helplessly in paroxysms of plethora upon beds of formality and red tape there are nations that will not fling away the empire of earth in order to slight an unknown man and insult a noble woman whose boots they are not fitted to unlatch there are nations not blinded to science not given over hand and foot to effete snobocracies and degenerate decadents in short mark my words there are other nations this speech it was that particularly impressed bert smallways if them germans or them americans get hold of this he said impressively to his brother the british empire's done it's u p the union jack so to speak won't be worth the paper it's written on tom i suppose you couldn't lend us a hand this morning said jessica in his impressive pause everybody in bun hill seems wanting early potatoes at once tom can't carry half of them we're living on a volcano said bert disregarding the suggestion at any moment war may come such a war he shook his head portentously you'd better take this lot first tom said jessica she turned briskly on bert can you spare us a morning she asked i dessay i can said bert the shop's very quiet s'morning though all this danger to the empire worries me something frightful work'll take it off your mind said jessica and presently he too was going out into a world of change and wonder bowed beneath a load of potatoes and patriotic insecurity that merged at last into a very definite irritation at the weight and want of style of the potatoes and a very clear conception of the entire detestableness of jessica chapter ii how bert smallways got into difficulties it did not occur to either tom or bert smallways that this remarkable aerial performance of mr butteridge was likely to affect either of their lives in any special manner that it would in any way single them out from the millions about them and when they had witnessed it from the crest of bun hill and seen the fly like mechanism its rotating planes a golden haze in the sunset sink humming to the harbour of its shed again they turned back towards the sunken green grocery beneath the great iron standard of the london to brighton mono rail and their minds reverted to the discussion that had engaged them before mr butteridge's triumph had come in sight out of the london haze it was a difficult and unsuccessful discussions they had to carry it on in shouts because of the moaning and roaring of the gyroscopic motor cars that traversed the high street and in its nature it was contentious and private the grubb business was in difficulties and grubb in a moment of financial eloquence had given a half share in it to bert whose relations with his employer had been for some time unsalaried and pallish and informal bert was trying to impress tom with the idea that the reconstructed grubb smallways offered unprecedented and unparalleled opportunities to the judicious small investor it was coming home to bert as though it were an entirely new fact that tom was singularly impervious to ideas in the end he put the financial issues on one side and making the thing entirely a matter of fraternal affection succeeded in borrowing a sovereign on the security of his word of honour the firm of grubb smallways formerly grubb had indeed been singularly unlucky in the last year or so for many years the business had struggled along with a flavour of romantic insecurity in a small dissolute looking shop in the high street adorned with brilliantly coloured advertisements of cycles a display of bells trouser clips oil cans pump clips frame cases wallets and other accessories and the announcement of bicycles on hire repairs free inflation petrol and similar attractions they were agents for several obscure makes of bicycle two samples constituted the stock and occasionally they effected a sale they also repaired punctures and did their best though luck was not always on their side with any other repairing that was brought to them they handled a line of cheap gramophones and did a little with musical boxes the staple of their business was however the letting of bicycles on hire it was a singular trade obeying no known commercial or economic principles indeed no principles there was a stock of ladies and gentlemen's bicycles in a state of disrepair that passes description and these the hiring stock were let to unexacting and reckless people inexpert in the things of this world at a nominal rate of one shilling for the first hour and sixpence per hour afterwards but really there were no fixed prices and insistent boys could get bicycles and the thrill of danger for an hour for so low a sum as threepence provided they could convince grubb that that was all they had the saddle and handle bar were then sketchily adjusted by grubb a deposit exacted except in the case of familiar boys the machine lubricated and the adventurer started upon his career usually he or she came back but at times when the accident was serious bert or grubb had to go out and fetch the machine home hire was always charged up to the hour of return to the shop and deducted from the deposit it was rare that a bicycle started out from their hands in a state of pedantic efficiency romantic possibilities of accident lurked in the worn thread of the screw that adjusted the saddle in the precarious pedals in the loose knit chain in the handle bars above all in the brakes and tyres tappings and clankings and strange rhythmic creakings awoke as the intrepid hirer pedalled out into the country then perhaps the bell would jam or a brake fail to act on a hill or the seat pillar would get loose and the saddle drop three or four inches with a disconcerting bump or the loose and rattling chain would jump the cogs of the chain wheel as the machine ran downhill and so bring the mechanism to an abrupt and disastrous stop without at the same time arresting the forward momentum of the rider or a tyre would bang or sigh quietly and give up the struggle for efficiency when the hirer returned a heated pedestrian grubb would ignore all verbal complaints and examine the machine gravely this ain't ad fair usage he used to begin he became a mild embodiment of the spirit of reason you can't expect a bicycle to take you up in its arms and carry you he used to say you got to show intelligence after all it's machinery sometimes the process of liquidating the consequent claims bordered on violence it was always a very rhetorical and often a trying affair but in these progressive times you have to make a noise to get a living it was often hard work but nevertheless this hiring was a fairly steady source of profit until one day all the panes in the window and door were broken and the stock on sale in the window greatly damaged and disordered by two over critical hirers with no sense of rhetorical irrelevance they were big coarse stokers from gravesend one was annoyed because his left pedal had come off and the other because his tyre had become deflated small and indeed negligible accidents by bun hill standards due entirely to the ungentle handling of the delicate machines entrusted to them and they failed to see clearly how they put themselves in the wrong by this method of argument it is a poor way of convincing a man that he has let you a defective machine to throw his foot pump about his shop and take his stock of gongs outside in order to return them through the window panes it carried no real conviction to the minds of either grubb or bert it only irritated and vexed them one quarrel makes many and this unpleasantness led to a violent dispute between grubb and the landlord upon the moral aspects of and legal responsibility for the consequent re glazing in the end grubb and smallways were put to the expense of a strategic nocturnal removal to another position it was a position they had long considered it was a small shed like shop with a plate glass window and one room behind just at the sharp bend in the road at the bottom of bun hill and here they struggled along bravely in spite of persistent annoyance from their former landlord hoping for certain eventualities the peculiar situation of the shop seemed to promise here too they were doomed to disappointment the high road from london to brighton that ran through bun hill was like the british empire or the british constitution a thing that had grown to its present importance unlike any other roads in europe the british high roads have never been subjected to any organised attempts to grade or straighten them out and to that no doubt their peculiar picturesqueness is to be ascribed the old bun hill high street drops at its end for perhaps eighty or a hundred feet of descent at an angle of one in five turns at right angles to the left runs in a curve for about thirty yards to a brick bridge over the dry ditch that had once been the otterbourne and then bends sharply to the right again round a dense clump of trees and goes on a simple straightforward peaceful high road there had been one or two horse and van and bicycle accidents in the place before the shop bert and grubb took was built and to be frank it was the probability of others that attracted them to it its possibilities had come to them first with a humorous flavour here's one of the places where a chap might get a living by keeping hens said grubb you can't get a living by keeping hens said bert you'd keep the hen and have it spatch cocked said grubb the motor chaps would pay for it when they really came to take the place they remembered this conversation hens however were out of the question there was no place for a run unless they had it in the shop it would have been obviously out of place there the shop was much more modern than their former one and had a plate glass front sooner or later said bert we shall get a motor car through this that's all right said grubb compensation i don't mind when that motor car comes along i don't mind even if it gives me a shock to the system and meanwhile said bert with great artfulness i'm going to buy myself a dog he did he bought three in succession he surprised the people at the dogs home in battersea by demanding a deaf retriever and rejecting every candidate that pricked up its ears i want a good deaf slow moving dog he said a dog that doesn't put himself out for things they displayed inconvenient curiosity they declared a great scarcity of deaf dogs you see they said dogs aren't deaf mine's got to be said bert i've had dogs that aren't deaf all i want it's like this you see i sell gramophones naturally i got to make em talk and tootle a bit to show em orf well a dog that isn't deaf doesn't like it gets excited smells round barks growls that upsets the customer see then a dog that has his hearing fancies things makes burglars out of passing tramps wants to fight every motor that makes a whizz all very well if you want livening up but our place is lively enough i don't want a dog of that sort i want a quiet dog in the end he got three in succession but none of them turned out well the first strayed off into the infinite heeding no appeals the second was killed in the night by a fruit motor waggon which fled before grubb could get down the third got itself entangled in the front wheel of a passing cyclist who came through the plate glass and proved to be an actor out of work and an undischarged bankrupt he demanded compensation for some fancied injury would hear nothing of the valuable dog he had killed or the window he had broken obliged"
