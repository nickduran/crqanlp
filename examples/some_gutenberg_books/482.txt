light from which cast a moving thorn pattern of shade on marty's face its rays soon fell upon a man whose clothes were roughly thrown on standing in advance of the speaker he was a thin slightly stooping figure with a small nervous mouth and a face cleanly shaven and he walked along the path with his eyes bent on the ground in the pair marty south recognized her employer melbury and his wife she was the second mrs melbury the first having died shortly after the birth of the timber merchant's only child tis no use to stay in bed he said as soon as she came up to where he was pacing restlessly about i can't sleep i keep thinking of things and worrying about the girl till i'm quite in a fever of anxiety he went on to say that he could not think why she marty knew he was speaking of his daughter did not answer his letter she must be ill she must certainly he said no no tis all right george said his wife and she assured him that such things always did appear so gloomy in the night time if people allowed their minds to run on them that when morning came it was seen that such fears were nothing but shadows grace is as well as you or i she declared but he persisted that she did not see all that she did not see as much as he his daughter's not writing was only one part of his worry on account of her he was anxious concerning money affairs which he would never alarm his mind about otherwise the reason he gave was that as she had nobody to depend upon for a provision but himself he wished her when he was gone to be securely out of risk of poverty to this mrs melbury replied that grace would be sure to marry well and that hence a hundred pounds more or less from him would not make much difference her husband said that that was what she mrs melbury naturally thought but there she was wrong and in that lay the source of his trouble i have a plan in my head about her he said and according to my plan she won't marry a rich man a plan for her not to marry well said his wife surprised well in one sense it is that replied melbury it is a plan for her to marry a particular person and as he has not so much money as she might expect it might be called as you call it i may not be able to carry it out and even if i do it may not be a good thing for her i want her to marry giles winterborne his companion repeated the name well it is all right she said presently he adores the very ground she walks on only he's close and won't show it much marty south appeared startled and could not tear herself away yes the timber merchant asserted he knew that well enough winterborne had been interested in his daughter for years that was what had led him into the notion of their union and he knew that she used to have no objection to him but it was not any difficulty about that which embarrassed him it was that since he had educated her so well and so long and so far above the level of daughters thereabout it was wasting her to give her to a man of no higher standing than the young man in question that's what i have been thinking said mrs melbury well then lucy now you've hit it answered the timber merchant with feeling there lies my trouble i vowed to let her marry him and to make her as valuable as i could to him by schooling her as many years and as thoroughly as possible i mean to keep my vow i made it because i did his father a terrible wrong and it was a weight on my conscience ever since that time till this scheme of making amends occurred to me through seeing that giles liked her wronged his father asked mrs melbury yes grievously wronged him said her husband well don't think of it to night she urged come indoors no no the air cools my head i shall not stay long he was silent a while then he told her as nearly as marty could gather that his first wife his daughter grace's mother was first the sweetheart of winterborne's father who loved her tenderly till he the speaker won her away from him by a trick because he wanted to marry her himself he sadly went on to say that the other man's happiness was ruined by it that though he married winterborne's mother it was but a half hearted business with him melbury added that he was afterwards very miserable at what he had done but that as time went on and the children grew up and seemed to be attached to each other he determined to do all he could to right the wrong by letting his daughter marry the lad not only that but to give her the best education he could afford so as to make the gift as valuable a one as it lay in his power to bestow i still mean to do it said melbury then do said she but all these things trouble me said he for i feel i am sacrificing her for my own sin and i think of her and often come down here and look at this look at what asked his wife he took the candle from her hand held it to the ground and removed a tile which lay in the garden path tis the track of her shoe that she made when she ran down here the day before she went away all those months ago i covered it up when she was gone and when i come here and look at it i ask myself again why should she be sacrificed to a poor man it is not altogether a sacrifice said the woman he is in love with her and he's honest and upright if she encourages him what can you wish for more i wish for nothing definite but there's a lot of things possible for her why mrs charmond is wanting some refined young lady i hear to go abroad with her as companion or something of the kind she'd jump at grace that's all uncertain better stick to what's sure true true said melbury and i hope it will be for the best yes let me get em married up as soon as i can so as to have it over and done with he continued looking at the imprint while he added suppose she should be dying and never make a track on this path any more she'll write soon depend upon't come tis wrong to stay here and brood so he admitted it but said he could not help it whether she write or no i shall fetch her in a few days and thus speaking he covered the track and preceded his wife indoors melbury perhaps was an unlucky man in having within him the sentiment which could indulge in this foolish fondness about the imprint of a daughter's footstep nature does not carry on her government with a view to such feelings and when advancing years render the open hearts of those who possess them less dexterous than formerly in shutting against the blast they must suffer buffeting at will by rain and storm no less than little celandines but her own existence and not mr melbury's was the centre of marty's consciousness and it was in relation to this that the matter struck her as she slowly withdrew that then is the secret of it all she said and giles winterborne is not for me and the less i think of him the better she returned to her cottage the sovereigns were staring at her from the looking glass as she had left them with a preoccupied countenance and with tears in her eyes she got a pair of scissors and began mercilessly cutting off the long locks of her hair arranging and tying them with their points all one way as the barber had directed upon the pale scrubbed deal of the coffin stool table they stretched like waving and ropy weeds over the washed gravel bed of a clear stream she would not turn again to the little looking glass out of humanity to herself knowing what a deflowered visage would look back at her and almost break her heart she dreaded it as much as did her own ancestral goddess sif the reflection in the pool after the rape of her locks by loke the malicious she steadily stuck to business wrapped the hair in a parcel and sealed it up after which she raked out the fire and went to bed having first set up an alarum made of a candle and piece of thread with a stone attached but such a reminder was unnecessary to night having tossed till about five o'clock marty heard the sparrows walking down their long holes in the thatch above her sloping ceiling to their orifice at the eaves whereupon she also arose and descended to the ground floor again it was still dark but she began moving about the house in those automatic initiatory acts and touches which represent among housewives the installation of another day while thus engaged she heard the rumbling of mr melbury's wagons and knew that there too the day's toil had begun an armful of gads thrown on the still hot embers caused them to blaze up cheerfully and bring her diminished head gear into sudden prominence as a shadow at this a step approached the door are folk astir here yet inquired a voice she knew well yes mr winterborne said marty throwing on a tilt bonnet which completely hid the recent ravages of the scissors come in the door was flung back and there stepped in upon the mat a man not particularly young for a lover nor particularly mature for a person of affairs there was reserve in his glance and restraint upon his mouth he carried a horn lantern which hung upon a swivel and wheeling as it dangled marked grotesque shapes upon the shadier part of the walls he said that he had looked in on his way down to tell her that they did not expect her father to make up his contract if he was not well mr melbury would give him another week and they would go their journey with a short load that day they are done said marty and lying in the cart house done he repeated your father has not been too ill to work after all then she made some evasive reply i'll show you where they be if you are going down she added they went out and walked together the pattern of the air holes in the top of the lantern being thrown upon the mist overhead where they appeared of giant size as if reaching the tent shaped sky they had no remarks to make to each other and they uttered none hardly anything could be more isolated or more self contained than the lives of these two walking here in the lonely antelucan hour when gray shades material and mental are so very gray and yet looked at in a certain way their lonely courses formed no detached design at all but were part of the pattern in the great web of human doings then weaving in both hemispheres from the white sea to cape horn the shed was reached and she pointed out the spars winterborne regarded them silently then looked at her now marty i believe he said and shook his head what that you've done the work yourself don't you tell anybody will you mr winterborne she pleaded by way of answer because i am afraid mr melbury may refuse my work if he knows it is mine but how could you learn to do it tis a trade trade said she i'd be bound to learn it in two hours oh no you wouldn't mrs marty winterborne held down his lantern and examined the cleanly split hazels as they lay marty he said with dry admiration your father with his forty years of practice never made a spar better than that they are too good for the thatching of houses they are good enough for the furniture but i won't tell let me look at your hands your poor hands he had a kindly manner of a quietly severe tone and when she seemed reluctant to show her hands he took hold of one and examined it as if it were his own her fingers were blistered they'll get harder in time she said for if father continues ill i shall have to go on wi it now i'll help put em up in wagon winterborne without speaking set down his lantern lifted her as she was about to stoop over the bundles placed her behind him and began throwing up the bundles himself rather than you should do it i will he said but the men will be here directly why marty whatever has happened to your head lord it has shrunk to nothing it looks an apple upon a gate post her heart swelled and she could not speak at length she managed to groan looking on the ground i've made myself ugly and hateful that's what i've done no no he answered you've only cut your hair i see now then why must you needs say that about apples and gate posts let me see no no she ran off into the gloom of the sluggish dawn he did not attempt to follow her when she reached her father's door she stood on the step and looked back mr melbury's men had arrived and were loading up the spars and their lanterns appeared from the distance at which she stood to have wan circles round them like eyes weary with watching she observed them for a few seconds as they set about harnessing the horses and then went indoors chapter iv there was now a distinct manifestation of morning in the air and presently the bleared white visage of a sunless winter day emerged like a dead born child the villagers everywhere had already bestirred themselves rising at this time of the year at the far less dreary hour of absolute darkness it had been above an hour earlier before a single bird had untucked his head that twenty lights were struck in as many bedrooms twenty pairs of shutters opened and twenty pairs of eyes stretched to the sky to forecast the weather for the day owls that had been catching mice in the out houses rabbits that had been eating the wintergreens in the gardens and stoats that had been sucking the blood of the rabbits discerning that their human neighbors were on the move discreetly withdrew from publicity and were seen and heard no more that day the daylight revealed the whole of mr melbury's homestead of which the wagon sheds had been an outlying erection it formed three sides of an open quadrangle and consisted of all sorts of buildings the largest and central one being the dwelling itself the fourth side of the quadrangle was the public road it was a dwelling house of respectable roomy almost dignified aspect which taken with the fact that there were the remains of other such buildings thereabout indicated that little hintock had at some time or other been of greater importance than now as its old name of hintock st osmond also testified the house was of no marked antiquity yet of well advanced age older than a stale novelty but no canonized antique faded not hoary looking at you from the still distinct middle distance of the early georgian time and awakening on that account the instincts of reminiscence more decidedly than the remoter and far grander memorials which have to speak from the misty reaches of mediaevalism the faces dress passions gratitudes and revenues of the great great grandfathers and grandmothers who had been the first to gaze from those rectangular windows and had stood under that key stoned doorway could be divined and measured by homely standards of to day it was a house in whose reverberations queer old personal tales were yet audible if properly listened for and not as with those of the castle and cloister silent beyond the possibility of echo the garden front remained much as it had always been and there was a porch and entrance that way but the principal house door opened on the square yard or quadrangle towards the road formerly a regular carriage entrance though the middle of the area was now made use of for stacking timber fagots bundles and other products of the wood it was divided from the lane by a lichen coated wall in which hung a pair of gates flanked by piers out of the perpendicular with a round white ball on the top of each the building on the left of the enclosure was a long backed erection now used for spar making sawing crib framing and copse ware manufacture in general opposite were the wagon sheds where marty had deposited her spars here winterborne had remained after the girl's abrupt departure to see that the wagon loads were properly made up winterborne was connected with the melbury family in various ways in addition to the sentimental relationship which arose from his father having been the first mrs melbury's lover winterborne's aunt had married and emigrated with the brother of the timber merchant many years before an alliance that was sufficient to place winterborne though the poorer on a footing of social intimacy with the melburys as in most villages so secluded as this intermarriages were of hapsburgian frequency among the inhabitants and there were hardly two houses in little hintock unrelated by some matrimonial tie or other for this reason a curious kind of partnership existed between melbury and the younger man a partnership based upon an unwritten code by which each acted in the way he thought fair towards the other on a give and take principle melbury with his timber and copse ware business found that the weight of his labor came in winter and spring winterborne was in the apple and cider trade and his requirements in cartage and other work came in the autumn of each year hence horses wagons and in some degree men were handed over to him when the apples began to fall he in return lending his assistance to melbury in the busiest wood cutting season as now before he had left the shed a boy came from the house to ask him to remain till mr melbury had seen him winterborne thereupon crossed over to the spar house where two or three men were already at work two of them being travelling spar makers from white hart lane who when this kind of work began made their appearance regularly and when it was over disappeared in silence till the season came again firewood was the one thing abundant in little hintock and a blaze of gad cuds made the outhouse gay with its light which vied with that of the day as yet in the hollow shades of the roof could be seen dangling etiolated arms of ivy which had crept through the joints of the tiles and were groping in vain for some support their leaves being dwarfed and sickly for want of sunlight others were pushing in with such force at the eaves as to lift from their supports the shelves that were fixed there besides the itinerant journey workers there were also present john upjohn engaged in the hollow turnery trade who lived hard by old timothy tangs and young timothy tangs top and bottom sawyers at work in mr melbury's pit outside farmer bawtree who kept the cider house and robert creedle an old man who worked for winterborne and stood warming his hands these latter being enticed in by the ruddy blaze though they had no particular business there none of them call for any remark except perhaps creedle to have completely described him it would have been necessary to write a military memoir for he wore under his smock frock a cast off soldier's jacket that had seen hot service its collar showing just above the flap of the frock also a hunting memoir to include the top boots that he had picked up by chance also chronicles of voyaging and shipwreck for his pocket knife had been given him by a weather beaten sailor but creedle carried about with him on his uneventful rounds these silent testimonies of war sport and adventure and thought nothing of their associations or their stories copse work as it was called being an occupation which the secondary intelligence of the hands and arms could carry on without requiring the sovereign attention of the head the minds of its professors wandered considerably from the objects before them hence the tales chronicles and ramifications of family history which were recounted here were of a very exhaustive kind and sometimes so interminable as to defy description winterborne seeing that melbury had not arrived stepped back again outside the door and the conversation interrupted by his momentary presence flowed anew reaching his ears as an accompaniment to the regular dripping of the fog from the plantation boughs around the topic at present handled was a highly popular and frequent one the personal character of mrs charmond the owner of the surrounding woods and groves my brother in law told me and i have no reason to doubt it said creedle that she'd sit down to her dinner with a frock hardly higher than her elbows oh you wicked woman he said to himself when he first see her you go to your church and sit and kneel as if your knee jints were greased with very saint's anointment and tell off your hear us good lords like a business man counting money and yet you can eat your victuals such a figure as that whether she's a reformed character by this time i can't say but i don't care who the man is that's how she went on when my brother in law lived there did she do it in her husband's time that i don't know hardly i should think considering his temper ah here creedle threw grieved remembrance into physical form by slowly resigning his head to obliquity and letting his eyes water that man not if the angels of heaven come down creedle he said shall you do another day's work for me yes he'd say anything anything and would as soon take a winged creature's name in vain as yours or mine well now i must get these spars home along and to morrow thank god i must see about using em an old woman now entered upon the scene she was mr melbury's servant and passed a great part of her time in crossing the yard between the house door and the spar shed whither she had come now for fuel she had two facial aspects one of a soft and flexible kind she used indoors when assisting about the parlor or upstairs the other with stiff lines and corners when she was bustling among the men in the spar house or out of doors ah grammer oliver said john upjohn it do do my heart good to see a old woman like you so dapper and stirring when i bear in mind that after fifty one year counts as two did afore but your smoke didn't rise this morning till twenty minutes past seven by my beater and that's late grammer oliver if you was a full sized man john people might take notice of your scornful meanings but your growing up was such a scrimped and scanty business that really a woman couldn't feel hurt if you were to spit fire and brimstone itself at her here she added holding out a spar gad to one of the workmen from which dangled a long black pudding here's something for thy breakfast and if you want tea you must fetch it from in doors mr melbury is late this morning said the bottom sawyer yes twas a dark dawn said mrs oliver even when i opened the door so late as i was you couldn't have told poor men from gentlemen or john from a reasonable sized object and i don't think maister's slept at all well to night he's anxious about his daughter and i know what that is for i've cried bucketfuls for my own when the old woman had gone creedle said he'll fret his gizzard green if he don't soon hear from that maid of his well learning is better than houses and lands but to keep a maid at school till she is taller out of pattens than her mother was in em tis tempting providence it seems no time ago that she was a little playward girl said young timothy tangs i can mind her mother said the hollow turner always a teuny delicate piece her touch upon your hand was as soft and cool as wind she was inoculated for the small pox and had it beautifully fine just about the time that i was out of my apprenticeship ay and a long apprenticeship twas i served that master of mine six years and three hundred and fourteen days the hollow turner pronounced the days with emphasis as if considering their number they were a rather more remarkable fact than the years mr winterborne's father walked with her at one time said old timothy tangs but mr melbury won her she was a child of a woman and would cry like rain if so be he huffed her whenever she and her husband came to a puddle in their walks together he'd take her up like a half penny doll and put her over without dirting her a speck and if he keeps the daughter so long at boarding school he'll make her as nesh as her mother was but here he comes just before this moment winterborne had seen melbury crossing the court from his door he was carrying an open letter in his hand and came straight to winterborne his gloom of the preceding night had quite gone i'd no sooner made up my mind giles to go and see why grace didn't come or write than i get a letter from her clifton wednesday my dear father says she i'm coming home to morrow that's to day but i didn't think it worth while to write long beforehand the little rascal and didn't she now giles as you are going to sherton market to day with your apple trees why not join me and grace there and we'll drive home all together he made the proposal with cheerful energy he was hardly the same man as the man of the small dark hours ever it happens that even among the moodiest the tendency to be cheered is stronger than the tendency to be cast down and a soul's specific gravity stands permanently less than that of the sea of troubles into which it is thrown winterborne though not demonstrative replied to this suggestion with something like alacrity there was not much doubt that marty's grounds for cutting off her hair were substantial enough if ambrose's eyes had been a reason for keeping it on as for the timber merchant it was plain that his invitation had been given solely in pursuance of his scheme for uniting the pair he had made up his mind to the course as a duty and was strenuously bent upon following it out accompanied by winterborne he now turned towards the door of the spar house when his footsteps were heard by the men as aforesaid well john and lot he said nodding as he entered a rimy morning tis sir said creedle energetically for not having as yet been able to summon force sufficient to go away and begin work he felt the necessity of throwing some into his speech i don't care who the man is tis the rimiest morning we've had this fall i heard you wondering why i've kept my daughter so long at boarding school resumed mr melbury looking up from the letter which he was reading anew by the fire and turning to them with the suddenness that was a trait in him hey he asked with affected shrewdness but you did you know well now though it is my own business more than anybody else's i'll tell ye when i was a boy another boy the pa'son's son along with a lot of others asked me who dragged whom round the walls of what and i said sam barrett who dragged his wife in a chair round the tower corner when she went to be churched they laughed at me with such torrents of scorn that i went home ashamed and couldn't sleep for shame and i cried that night till my pillow was wet till at last i thought to myself there and then they may laugh at me for my ignorance but that was father's"
