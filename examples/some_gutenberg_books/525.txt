"1" "went eight knots everything cracked aloft and we tied our caps to our heads but mostly she strolled on at the rate of three miles an hour what could you expect she was tired that old ship her youth was where mine is where yours is you fellows who listen to this yarn and what friend would throw your years and your weariness in your face we didn't grumble at her to us aft at least it seemed as though we had been born in her reared in her had lived in her for ages had never known any other ship i would just as soon have abused the old village church at home for not being a cathedral and for me there was also my youth to make me patient there was all the east before me and all life and the thought that i had been tried in that ship and had come out pretty well and i thought of men of old who centuries ago went that road in ships that sailed no better to the land of palms and spices and yellow sands and of brown nations ruled by kings more cruel than nero the roman and more splendid than solomon the jew the old bark lumbered on heavy with her age and the burden of her cargo while i lived the life of youth in ignorance and hope she lumbered on through an interminable procession of days and the fresh gilding flashed back at the setting sun seemed to cry out over the darkening sea the words painted on her stern _judea_ london do or die then we entered the indian ocean and steered northerly for java head the winds were light weeks slipped by she crawled on do or die and people at home began to think of posting us as overdue one saturday evening i being off duty the men asked me to give them an extra bucket of water or so for washing clothes as i did not wish to screw on the fresh water pump so late i went forward whistling and with a key in my hand to unlock the forepeak scuttle intending to serve the water out of a spare tank we kept there the smell down below was as unexpected as it was frightful one would have thought hundreds of paraffin lamps had been flaring and smoking in that hole for days i was glad to get out the man with me coughed and said funny smell sir i answered negligently it's good for the health they say and walked aft the first thing i did was to put my head down the square of the midship ventilator as i lifted the lid a visible breath something like a thin fog a puff of faint haze rose from the opening the ascending air was hot and had a heavy sooty paraffiny smell i gave one sniff and put down the lid gently it was no use choking myself the cargo was on fire next day she began to smoke in earnest you see it was to be expected for though the coal was of a safe kind that cargo had been so handled so broken up with handling that it looked more like smithy coal than anything else then it had been wetted more than once it rained all the time we were taking it back from the hulk and now with this long passage it got heated and there was another case of spontaneous combustion the captain called us into the cabin he had a chart spread on the table and looked unhappy he said the coast of west australia is near but i mean to proceed to our destination it is the hurricane month too but we will just keep her head for bankok and fight the fire no more putting back anywhere if we all get roasted we will try first to stifle this ere damned combustion by want of air we tried we battened down everything and still she smoked the smoke kept coming out through imperceptible crevices it forced itself through bulkheads and covers it oozed here and there and everywhere in slender threads in an invisible film in an incomprehensible manner it made its way into the cabin into the forecastle it poisoned the sheltered places on the deck it could be sniffed as high as the main yard it was clear that if the smoke came out the air came in this was disheartening this combustion refused to be stifled we resolved to try water and took the hatches off enormous volumes of smoke whitish yellowish thick greasy misty choking ascended as high as the trucks all hands cleared out aft then the poisonous cloud blew away and we went back to work in a smoke that was no thicker now than that of an ordinary factory chimney we rigged the force pump got the hose along and by and by it burst well it was as old as the ship a prehistoric hose and past repair then we pumped with the feeble head pump drew water with buckets and in this way managed in time to pour lots of indian ocean into the main hatch the bright stream flashed in sunshine fell into a layer of white crawling smoke and vanished on the black surface of coal steam ascended mingling with the smoke we poured salt water as into a barrel without a bottom it was our fate to pump in that ship to pump out of her to pump into her and after keeping water out of her to save ourselves from being drowned we frantically poured water into her to save ourselves from being burnt and she crawled on do or die in the serene weather the sky was a miracle of purity a miracle of azure the sea was polished was blue was pellucid was sparkling like a precious stone extending on all sides all round to the horizon as if the whole terrestrial globe had been one jewel one colossal sapphire a single gem fashioned into a planet and on the luster of the great calm waters the _judea_ glided imperceptibly enveloped in languid and unclean vapours in a lazy cloud that drifted to leeward light and slow a pestiferous cloud defiling the splendour of sea and sky all this time of course we saw no fire the cargo smoldered at the bottom somewhere once mahon as we were working side by side said to me with a queer smile now if she only would spring a tidy leak like that time when we first left the channel it would put a stopper on this fire wouldn't it i remarked irrelevantly do you remember the rats we fought the fire and sailed the ship too as carefully as though nothing had been the matter the steward cooked and attended on us of the other twelve men eight worked while four rested everyone took his turn captain included there was equality and if not exactly fraternity then a deal of good feeling sometimes a man as he dashed a bucketful of water down the hatchway would yell out hurrah for bankok and the rest laughed but generally we were taciturn and serious and thirsty oh how thirsty and we had to be careful with the water strict allowance the ship smoked the sun blazed pass the bottle we tried everything we even made an attempt to dig down to the fire no good of course no man could remain more than a minute below mahon who went first fainted there and the man who went to fetch him out did likewise we lugged them out on deck then i leaped down to show how easily it could be done they had learned wisdom by that time and contented themselves by fishing for me with a chain hook tied to a broom handle i believe i did not offer to go and fetch up my shovel which was left down below things began to look bad we put the long boat into the water the second boat was ready to swing out we had also another a fourteen foot thing on davits aft where it was quite safe then behold the smoke suddenly decreased we re doubled our efforts to flood the bottom of the ship in two days there was no smoke at all everybody was on the broad grin this was on a friday on saturday no work but sailing the ship of course was done the men washed their clothes and their faces for the first time in a fortnight and had a special dinner given them they spoke of spontaneous combustion with contempt and implied _they_ were the boys to put out combustions somehow we all felt as though we each had inherited a large fortune but a beastly smell of burning hung about the ship captain beard had hollow eyes and sunken cheeks i had never noticed so much before how twisted and bowed he was he and mahon prowled soberly about hatches and ventilators sniffing it struck me suddenly poor mahon was a very very old chap as to me i was as pleased and proud as though i had helped to win a great naval battle o youth the night was fine in the morning a homeward bound ship passed us hull down the first we had seen for months but we were nearing the land at last java head being about 190 miles off and nearly due north next day it was my watch on deck from eight to twelve at breakfast the captain observed it's wonderful how that smell hangs about the cabin about ten the mate being on the poop i stepped down on the main deck for a moment the carpenter's bench stood abaft the mainmast i leaned against it sucking at my pipe and the carpenter a young chap came to talk to me he remarked i think we have done very well haven't we and then i perceived with annoyance the fool was trying to tilt the bench i said curtly don't chips and immediately became aware of a queer sensation of an absurd delusion i seemed somehow to be in the air i heard all round me like a pent up breath released as if a thousand giants simultaneously had said phoo and felt a dull concussion which made my ribs ache suddenly no doubt about it i was in the air and my body was describing a short parabola but short as it was i had the time to think several thoughts in as far as i can remember the following order this can't be the carpenter what is it some accident submarine volcano coals gas by jove we are being blown up everybody's dead i am falling into the after hatch i see fire in it the coal dust suspended in the air of the hold had glowed dull red at the moment of the explosion in the twinkling of an eye in an infinitesimal fraction of a second since the first tilt of the bench i was sprawling full length on the cargo i picked myself up and scrambled out it was quick like a rebound the deck was a wilderness of smashed timber lying crosswise like trees in a wood after a hurricane an immense curtain of soiled rags waved gently before me it was the mainsail blown to strips i thought the masts will be toppling over directly and to get out of the way bolted on all fours towards the poop ladder the first person i saw was mahon with eyes like saucers his mouth open and the long white hair standing straight on end round his head like a silver halo he was just about to go down when the sight of the main deck stirring heaving up and changing into splinters before his eyes petrified him on the top step i stared at him in unbelief and he stared at me with a queer kind of shocked curiosity i did not know that i had no hair no eyebrows no eyelashes that my young moustache was burnt off that my face was black one cheek laid open my nose cut and my chin bleeding i had lost my cap one of my slippers and my shirt was torn to rags of all this i was not aware i was amazed to see the ship still afloat the poop deck whole and most of all to see anybody alive also the peace of the sky and the serenity of the sea were distinctly surprising i suppose i expected to see them convulsed with horror pass the bottle there was a voice hailing the ship from somewhere in the air in the sky i couldn't tell presently i saw the captain and he was mad he asked me eagerly where's the cabin table and to hear such a question was a frightful shock i had just been blown up you understand and vibrated with that experience i wasn't quite sure whether i was alive mahon began to stamp with both feet and yelled at him good god don't you see the deck's blown out of her i found my voice and stammered out as if conscious of some gross neglect of duty i don't know where the cabin table is it was like an absurd dream do you know what he wanted next well he wanted to trim the yards very placidly and as if lost in thought he insisted on having the foreyard squared i don't know if there's anybody alive said mahon almost tearfully surely he said gently there will be enough left to square the foreyard the old chap it seems was in his own berth winding up the chronometers when the shock sent him spinning immediately it occurred to him as he said afterwards that the ship had struck something and he ran out into the cabin there he saw the cabin table had vanished somewhere the deck being blown up it had fallen down into the lazarette of course where we had our breakfast that morning he saw only a great hole in the floor this appeared to him so awfully mysterious and impressed him so immensely that what he saw and heard after he got on deck were mere trifles in comparison and mark he noticed directly the wheel deserted and his barque off her course and his only thought was to get that miserable stripped undecked smouldering shell of a ship back again with her head pointing at her port of destination bankok that's what he was after i tell you this quiet bowed bandy legged almost deformed little man was immense in the singleness of his idea and in his placid ignorance of our agitation he motioned us forward with a commanding gesture and went to take the wheel himself yes that was the first thing we did trim the yards of that wreck no one was killed or even disabled but everyone was more or less hurt you should have seen them some were in rags with black faces like coal heavers like sweeps and had bullet heads that seemed closely cropped but were in fact singed to the skin others of the watch below awakened by being shot out from their collapsing bunks shivered incessantly and kept on groaning even as we went about our work but they all worked that crew of liverpool hard cases had in them the right stuff it's my experience they always have it is the sea that gives it the vastness the loneliness surrounding their dark stolid souls ah well we stumbled we crept we fell we barked our shins on the wreckage we hauled the masts stood but we did not know how much they might be charred down below it was nearly calm but a long swell ran from the west and made her roll they might go at any moment we looked at them with apprehension one could not foresee which way they would fall then we retreated aft and looked about us the deck was a tangle of planks on edge of planks on end of splinters of ruined woodwork the masts rose from that chaos like big trees above a matted undergrowth the interstices of that mass of wreckage were full of something whitish sluggish stirring of something that was like a greasy fog the smoke of the invisible fire was coming up again was trailing like a poisonous thick mist in some valley choked with dead wood already lazy wisps were beginning to curl upwards amongst the mass of splinters here and there a piece of timber stuck upright resembled a post half of a fife rail had been shot through the foresail and the sky made a patch of glorious blue in the ignobly soiled canvas a portion of several boards holding together had fallen across the rail and one end protruded overboard like a gangway leading upon nothing like a gangway leading over the deep sea leading to death as if inviting us to walk the plank at once and be done with our ridiculous troubles and still the air the sky a ghost something invisible was hailing the ship someone had the sense to look over and there was the helmsman who had impulsively jumped overboard anxious to come back he yelled and swam lustily like a merman keeping up with the ship we threw him a rope and presently he stood amongst us streaming with water and very crestfallen the captain had surrendered the wheel and apart elbow on rail and chin in hand gazed at the sea wistfully we asked ourselves what next i thought now this is something like this is great i wonder what will happen o youth suddenly mahon sighted a steamer far astern captain beard said we may do something with her yet we hoisted two flags which said in the international language of the sea on fire want immediate assistance the steamer grew bigger rapidly and by and by spoke with two flags on her foremast i am coming to your assistance in half an hour she was abreast to windward within hail and rolling slightly with her engines stopped we lost our composure and yelled all together with excitement we've been blown up a man in a white helmet on the bridge cried yes all right all right and he nodded his head and smiled and made soothing motions with his hand as though at a lot of frightened children one of the boats dropped in the water and walked towards us upon the sea with her long oars four calashes pulled a swinging stroke this was my first sight of malay seamen i've known them since but what struck me then was their unconcern they came alongside and even the bowman standing up and holding to our main chains with the boat hook did not deign to lift his head for a glance i thought people who had been blown up deserved more attention a little man dry like a chip and agile like a monkey clambered up it was the mate of the steamer he gave one look and cried o boys you had better quit we were silent he talked apart with the captain for a time seemed to argue with him then they went away together to the steamer when our skipper came back we learned that the steamer was the _sommerville_ captain nash from west australia to singapore via batavia with mails and that the agreement was she should tow us to anjer or batavia if possible where we could extinguish the fire by scuttling and then proceed on our voyage to bankok the old man seemed excited we will do it yet he said to mahon fiercely he shook his fist at the sky nobody else said a word at noon the steamer began to tow she went ahead slim and high and what was left of the _judea_ followed at the end of seventy fathom of tow rope followed her swiftly like a cloud of smoke with mastheads protruding above we went aloft to furl the sails we coughed on the yards and were careful about the bunts do you see the lot of us there putting a neat furl on the sails of that ship doomed to arrive nowhere there was not a man who didn't think that at any moment the masts would topple over from aloft we could not see the ship for smoke and they worked carefully passing the gaskets with even turns harbour furl aloft there cried mahon from below you understand this i don't think one of those chaps expected to get down in the usual way when we did i heard them saying to each other well i thought we would come down overboard in a lump sticks and all blame me if i didn't that's what i was thinking to myself would answer wearily another battered and bandaged scarecrow and mind these were men without the drilled in habit of obedience to an onlooker they would be a lot of profane scallywags without a redeeming point what made them do it what made them obey me when i thinking consciously how fine it was made them drop the bunt of the foresail twice to try and do it better what they had no professional reputation no examples no praise it wasn't a sense of duty they all knew well enough how to shirk and laze and dodge when they had a mind to it and mostly they had was it the two pounds ten a month that sent them there they didn't think their pay half good enough no it was something in them something inborn and subtle and everlasting i don't say positively that the crew of a french or german merchantman wouldn't have done it but i doubt whether it would have been done in the same way there was a completeness in it something solid like a principle and masterful like an instinct a disclosure of something secret of that hidden something that gift of good or evil that makes racial difference that shapes the fate of nations it was that night at ten that for the first time since we had been fighting it we saw the fire the speed of the towing had fanned the smoldering destruction a blue gleam appeared forward shining below the wreck of the deck it wavered in patches it seemed to stir and creep like the light of a glowworm i saw it first and told mahon then the game's up he said we had better stop this towing or she will burst out suddenly fore and aft before we can clear out we set up a yell rang bells to attract their attention they towed on at last mahon and i had to crawl forward and cut the rope with an ax there was no time to cast off the lashings red tongues could be seen licking the wilderness of splinters under our feet as we made our way back to the poop of course they very soon found out in the steamer that the rope was gone she gave a loud blast of her whistle her lights were seen sweeping in a wide circle she came up ranging close alongside and stopped we were all in a tight group on the poop looking at her every man had saved a little bundle or a bag suddenly a conical flame with a twisted top shot up forward and threw upon the black sea a circle of light with the two vessels side by side and heaving gently in its center captain beard had been sitting on the gratings still and mute for hours but now he rose slowly and advanced in front of us to the mizzen shrouds captain nash hailed come along look sharp i have mail bags on board i will take you and your boats to singapore thank you no said our skipper we must see the last of the ship i can't stand by any longer shouted the other mails you know ay ay we are all right very well i'll report you in singapore good bye he waved his hand our men dropped their bundles quietly the steamer moved ahead and passing out of the circle of light vanished at once from our sight dazzled by the fire which burned fiercely and then i knew that i would see the east first as commander of a small boat i thought it fine and the fidelity to the old ship was fine we should see the last of her oh the glamour of youth oh the fire of it more dazzling than the flames of the burning ship throwing a magic light on the wide earth leaping audaciously to the sky presently to be quenched by time more cruel more pitiless more bitter than the sea and like the flames of the burning ship surrounded by an impenetrable night the old man warned us in his gentle and inflexible way that it was part of our duty to save for the under writers as much as we could of the ship's gear according we went to work aft while she blazed forward to give us plenty of light we lugged out a lot of rubbish what didn't we save an old barometer fixed with an absurd quantity of screws nearly cost me my life a sudden rush of smoke came upon me and i just got away in time there were various stores bolts of canvas coils of rope the poop looked like a marine bazaar and the boats were lumbered to the gunwales one would have thought the old man wanted to take as much as he could of his first command with him he was very very quiet but off his balance evidently would you believe it he wanted to take a length of old stream cable and a kedge anchor with him in the long boat we said ay ay sir deferentially and on the quiet let the thing slip overboard the heavy medicine chest went that way two bags of green coffee tins of paint fancy paint a whole lot of things then i was ordered with two hands into the boats to make a stowage and get them ready against the time it would be proper for us to leave the ship we put everything straight stepped the long boat's mast for our skipper who was in charge of her and i was not sorry to sit down for a moment my face felt raw every limb ached as if broken i was aware of all my ribs and would have sworn to a twist in the back bone the boats fast astern lay in a deep shadow and all around i could see the circle of the sea lighted by the fire a gigantic flame arose forward straight and clear it flared there with noises like the whir of wings with rumbles as of thunder there were cracks detonations and from the cone of flame the sparks flew upwards as man is born to trouble to leaky ships and to ships that burn what bothered me was that the ship lying broadside to the swell and to such wind as there was a mere breath the boats would not keep astern where they were safe but persisted in a pig headed way boats have in getting under the counter and then swinging alongside they were knocking about dangerously and coming near the flame while the ship rolled on them and of course there was always the danger of the masts going over the side at any moment i and my two boat keepers kept them off as best we could with oars and boat hooks but to be constantly at it became exasperating since there was no reason why we should not leave at once we could not see those on board nor could we imagine what caused the delay the boat keepers were swearing feebly and i had not only my share of the work but also had to keep at it two men who showed a constant inclination to lay themselves down and let things slide at last i hailed on deck there and someone looked over we're ready here i said the head disappeared and very soon popped up again the captain says all right sir and to keep the boats well clear of the ship half an hour passed suddenly there was a frightful racket rattle clanking of chain hiss of water and millions of sparks flew up into the shivering column of smoke that stood leaning slightly above the ship the cat heads had burned away and the two red hot anchors had gone to the bottom tearing out after them two hundred fathom of red hot chain the ship trembled the mass of flame swayed as if ready to collapse and the fore top gallant mast fell it darted down like an arrow of fire shot under and instantly leaping up within an oar's length of the boats floated quietly very black on the luminous sea i hailed the deck again after some time a man in an unexpectedly cheerful but also muffled tone as though he had been trying to speak with his mouth shut informed me coming directly sir and vanished for a long time i heard nothing but the whir and roar of the fire there were also whistling sounds the boats jumped tugged at the painters ran at each other playfully knocked their sides together or do what we would swung in a bunch against the ship's side i couldn't stand it any longer and swarming up a rope clambered"
