"1" "also affinities between men and things if you choose to call a ship which has a spirit of its own merely a thing there must have been this affinity between cleggett and the jasper b only an unusual person would have thought of buying her but cleggett loved her at first sight within an hour after he had first seen her he was in mr abraham goldberg's office as he was concluding his purchase mr goldberg having phoned cleggett's bankers he was surprised to discover that he was buying about half an acre of long island real estate along with her for that matter he had thought it a little odd in the first place when he had been directed to a real estate agent as the owner of the craft but as he knew very little about business and nothing at all about ships he assumed that perhaps it was quite the usual thing for real estate dealers to buy and sell ships abutting on the coast of long island i had only intended to buy the vessel said cleggett i don't know that i'll be able to use the land mr goldberg looked at cleggett with a slight start as if he were not sure that he had heard aright and opened his mouth as if to say something but nothing came of it not just then at least when the last signature had been written and clegget's check had been folded by mr goldberg's plump bejeweled fingers and put into mr goldberg's pocketbook mr goldberg remarked you say you can't use the ship no the land i'm surprised to find that the land goes with the ship why it doesn't said mr goldberg it's the ship that goes with the land she was on the land when i bought the plot and i just left her there nobody's paid any attention to her for years the words on the land grated on cleggett you mean on the water don't you in the mud then suggested mr goldberg but she'll sail all right said cleggett i suppose if she was decorated up with sails and things she'd sail figuring on sailing her anywhere in particular subtly irritated cleggett answered oh no no not anywhere in particular going to live on her this summer outdoor sleeping room and all that i'm thinking of it you could turn her into a house boat easy enough i had a friend who turned an old barge like that into a house boat and had a lot of fun with her barge cleggett rose and buttoned his coat the conversation was somehow growing more and more distasteful to him you wouldn't call the jasper b a barge would you well you wouldn't call her a yacht would you said mr goldberg perhaps not admitted cleggett perhaps not she's more like a bark than a yacht a bark i dunno always thought a bark was bigger a scow's more her size ain't it scow cleggett frowned the jasper b a scow you mean a schooner don't you schooner mr goldberg grinned good naturedly at his departing customer a kind of a schooner scow huh no sir a schooner said cleggett reddening and turning in the doorway understand me mr goldberg a schooner sir a schooner and standing with a frown on his face until every vestige of the smile had died from mr goldberg's lips cleggett repeated once more a schooner mr goldberg yes sir there's no doubt of it a schooner mr cleggett said mr goldberg turning pale and backing away from the door the ordinary man inspects a house or a horse first and buys it or fails to buy it afterward but genius scorns conventions cleggett was not an ordinary man he often moved straight towards his object by inspiration great poets and great adventurers share this faculty cleggett paid for the jasper b first and went back to inspect his purchase later the vessel lay about two miles from the center of fairport he could get within half a mile of it by trolley nevertheless when he reached the jasper b again after leaving mr goldberg it was getting along towards dusk he first entered the cabin it was of a good size and divided into several compartments but it was in a state of dilapidation and littered with a jumble of odds and ends which looked like the ruins of a barroom as he turned to ascend to the deck again after possibly five minutes intending to take a look at the forecastle next he heard the sound of a motor looking out of the cabin he saw a taxicab approaching the boat from the direction of fairport it was a large machine but it was overloaded with seven or eight men it stopped within twenty yards of the vessel and two men got out one of them evidently a person who imposed some sort of leadership on the rest of the party this was a tall fellow with a slouching gait and round shoulders and yet to judge from his movements he was both quick and powerful the other was a short stout man with a commonplace broad red face and flaxen hair the two stood for a moment in colloquy in the road that led from fairport proper to the bayside passing near the jasper b and cleggett heard the shorter of the two men say i'm sure i saw somebody aboard of her how long ago heinrich asked the tall man an hour or so said heinrich it was old man abernethy he's harmless said the tall fellow he's the only person that's been aboard her in years there was someone else persisted heinrich someone who was talking to abernethy the tall man mumbled something about having been a fool not to buy her before this cleggett did not catch all of the remark then the tall fellow said we'll go aboard heinrich and take a look around with that they advanced towards the vessel cleggett stepped on deck from the cabin companionway and both men stopped short at the sight of him heinrich obviously a trifle confused but the other one in no wise abashed he made no attempt this tall fellow to give the situation a casual turn what he did was to stand and stare at cleggett candidly and with more than a touch of insolence as if trying to beat down cleggett's gaze cleggett staring in his turn perceived that the tall man ungainly as he was affected a bizarre individualism in the matter of dress his clothing cried out rather than suggested that it was expensive his feet were cased in button shoes with fancy tops his waistcoat cut in the extreme of style revealed that little strip of white which falsely advertises a second waistcoat beneath but in his case the strip was too broad there were diamonds on the fingers of both powerful hands but the thing that grated particularly upon cleggett was the character of the man's scarfpin it was by far the largest ornament of the sort that cleggett had ever seen he was near enough to the fellow to make out that it had been carved from a piece of solid ivory in the likeness of a skull in the eyeholes of the skull two opals flamed with an evil levin the man suggested to cleggett at first glance a bartender who had come into money or a drayman who had been promoted to an important office in a labor union and was spending the most of a considerable salary on his person and yet his face more closely observed somehow gave the lie to his clothes for it was not lacking in the signs of intelligence in spite of his taste or rather lack of taste there was no hint of weakness in his physiognomy his features were harsh bold predatory a slightly yellowish tinge about the temples and cheek bones suggestive of the ivory ornament proclaimed a bilious temperament cleggett both puzzled and nettled by the man's persistent gaze advanced towards him across the deck of the jasper b and down the gangplank hand on hip and called out sharply well my friend you will know me the next time you see me the tall man turned without a word and walked back to the taxicab the occupants of which had watched this singular duel of looks in silence in the act of getting into the machine he face about again and said with a lift of the lip that showed two long protruding canine teeth of an almost saffron hue i will know you again he spoke with a kind of cold hostility that gave his words all the effect of a threat cleggett felt the blood leap faster through his veins he tingled with a fierce illogical desire to strike the fellow on the mouth his soul stirred with a premonition of conflict and the desire for it and yet on the surface of things at least the man had been nothing more than rude as cleggett watched the machine make off towards an isolated road house on the bayside he wondered at the quick intensity of his own antipathy unconsciously he flexed his wrist in his characteristic gesture scarcely knowing that he spoke he murmured that man gets on my nerves that man was destined to do something more than get on cleggett's nerves before the adventures of the jasper b were ended chapter iv a bad man to cross the isolated road house on the bay was a nondescript jumbled dilapidated looking assemblage of structures rather than one house it was known simply as morris's it stood a few hundred yards west of the end of the canal which opened into the bay and was about a quarter of a mile from the jasper b the canal itself was broad straight low banked and about three quarters of a mile in length the town had thrown out a few ranks of cottages in the direction of the canal but these were all summer bungalows occupied only from june until the middle of september the solider and more permanent part of fairport was well withdrawn from the sandy sedgy stretches that bordered on tidewater at the north and inland terminus of the quiet strip of water in which the jasper b reposed was a collection of buildings including bathhouses a boathouse and a sort of shed where soft drinks and sea food were served during the bathing season this place was known as parker's beach and was open only during the summer morris's was of quite a different character from parker's beach one could bathe at morris's but the beach near by was not particularly good one could hire boats there and buy bait for a fishing trip in one of its phases it made some pretensions to being a summer hotel it had an extensive barroom there was a dancing floor none too smooth there were long verandahs on three sides that on the south side was built on piles people ate and drank there in the summer beneath it the water swished and gurgled when the tide was in the townspeople of fairport or the more respectable ones kept away from morris's summer and winter summer transients inhabitants of the bungalows during the bathing season patronized the place but most of the patronage at all seasons seemed to consist of automobile parties from the city people apparently drawn from all classes or eluding definite classification entirely in the bleakest season there was always a little stir of dubious activity about morris's in the summer it impressed you with its look of cheapness in the winter squatted by the cold water amidst its huddle of unpainted outhouses at the end of a stretch of desolate beach the fancy gave morris's a touch of the sinister cleggett was anxious to get the jasper b into seaworthy condition as soon as possible it occurred to him that the employment of expert advice should be his first step and early the next morning he hired captain abernethy that descendant of a seafaring family though he felt it incumbent upon him to offer objections that had to be overcome with a great show of respect was really overjoyed at the commission he left his own cottage a mile or so away and took up his abode in the forecastle at once by nine o'clock that morning cleggett had a force of workmen renovating both cabin and forecastle putting the cook's galley into working order and cleansing the decks of soil and sand that night cleggett spent on the vessel with captain abernethy by saturday of the same week cleggett had bought the vessel on wednesday he was able to take up his abode in the cabin with his books and arms about him to his library he had added a treatise on navigation and reflecting that his firearms were worthless considered as modern weapons he also purchased a score of 44 caliber colt's revolvers and automatic pistols of the latest pattern and a dozen magazine rifles he brought on board at the same time for cook and cabin boy a japanese lad who said he was a sailor and who called himself yoshahira kuroki and a greek george stefanopolous the latter was a handsome rather burly fellow of about thirty a man with a kindling eye and a habit of boasting of his ancestors among them he declared was leonidas the hero of thermopylae george admitted he was not a sailor but professed a willingness to learn and looked so capable as he squared his bulky shoulders and twisted his fine black mustache that cleggett engaged him taking him immediately from the dairy lunch room in which he had been employed george's idea was to work his way back to greece he said on the jasper b if she did not sail for greece for some time george was willing to wait he was patient sometime no doubt she would touch the shores of greece the hold of the jasper b cleggett and captain abernethy found to be in a chaotic state casks barrels empty bottles by the hundred ruins of benches tables chairs old nondescript pieces of planking broken crates and boxes were flung together there in moldering confusion it was evident that after the scheme of using the jasper b s hulk as one of the attractions of a pleasure resort had failed all the debris of the failure had simply been thrown pell mell into the hold cleggett and captain abernethy decided that the vessel which was stepped for two masts should be rigged as a schooner the captain was soon busy securing estimates on the amount of work that would have to be done and the cost of it the pile of rubbish in the hold which filled it to such an extent that cleggett gave up the attempt to examine it was to be removed by the same contractor who put in the sticks all the activity on board and about the jasper b had not gone on without attracting the attention of morris's cleggett noticed that there was usually someone in the neighborhood of that dubious resort cocking an eye in the direction of the vessel indeed the interest became so pronounced and seemed of a quality so different from ordinary frank rustic curiosity that it looked very like espionage it had struck cleggett that morris's seemed at all times to have more than its share of idlers and hangers on men who appeared to make the place their headquarters and were not to be confused with the occasional off season parties from the city on sunday morning cleggett was awakened by captain abernethy who announced strange craft lookin us over mighty close sir a strange craft where is she cleggett was instantly alert she's a house boat if you was to ask me said the brown old man in a new brown suit and with his whiskers newly trimmed he gave the impression of having been overhauled and freshly painted where is she repeated cleggett beginning to get into his clothes she must a sneaked up an anchored mighty early this mornin pursued cap'n abernethy true to his conversational principles is she in the bay or in the canal she looks like a mighty toney kind o vessel said cap'n abernethy if i was to make a guess i'd say she was one of them craft that sails herself along when she wants to with one of these newfangled gasoline engines she wasn't towed here then cleggett gave up the attempt to learn from the captain just where the house boat was she lies in the canal said the cap'n having established the point that he could not be forced to tell where she lay he volunteered the information as a personal favor from one gentleman to another she lies ahead of us in the canal a p'int or so off our port bow i should say and if you was to ask me i'd say she wasn't layin there for any good purpose what do you think she's up to what makes you suspicious of her no sir she wasn't towed in said cap'n abernethy or i'd a heard a tug towin her comin of a seafarin fambly i'm a light sleeper by nature cleggett finished dressing and went on deck sure enough towards the south end of the canal three or four hundred yards south of the jasper b and about the same distance east of morris's was anchored a house boat she was painted a slaty gray color as cleggett looked at her a man stepped up on the deck and putting a binocular glass to his eye began to study the jasper b after a few minutes of steady scrutiny this person turned his attention to morris's looking towards morris's himself cleggett saw a man standing on the east verandah of that resort intently scanning the house boat through a glass cleggett went into the cabin and got his own glass presently the man on morris's verandah and the man of the house boat ceased to scrutinize each other and both turned their glasses upon the jasper b but the moment they perceived that cleggett was provided with a glass each turned hastily and entered the one morris's place and the other the cabin of the house boat but cleggett had already recognized the man at morris's as the stoop shouldered man of tall stature and fanciful dress who had tried to stare him down some days before as for the man on the house boat which as cleggett had made out was named the annabel lee there was something vaguely familiar about his general appearance which puzzled and tantalized our hero as the morning wore on cleggett became certain that the jasper b was closely watched by both the annabel lee and morris's although the watchers avoided showing themselves plainly a slightly agitated blind at a second story window over the verandah showed him where the tall man or one of his associates gazed out from morris's and from a porthole of the annabel lee he could see a glass thrust forth from time to time it was evident to him that the annabel lee and morris's were suspicious of each other and that both suspected the jasper b but of what did they suspect cleggett what intention did they impute to him he could only wonder through the entire morning he was conscious of the continuance of this watch he thought it ceased about luncheon time but at two in the afternoon he was certain that if so it had been resumed cleggett innocent and honorable began to get impatient of this persistent scrutiny and in spite of his courage a vague uneasiness began to possess him towards the end of the afternoon he called his little company aft and spoke to them my men he said i do not like the attitude of our neighbors to put it briefly there may be squalls ahead of the jasper b this is a wild and desolate coast comparatively speaking strange things have happened to innocent people before this along the shores of long island it is well to be prepared i intend to serve out to each of you two hundred cartridges and a 44 caliber colt's in case of an attempt to board you may find these cutlasses handy cap'n abernethy in all nautical matters you will still be in command of the ship but in case of a military demonstration all of you will look to me for leadership you may go now and rig up a jury mast and bend the american colors to the peak and in case of blows may god defend the right i know i do not need to exhort you to do your duty as cleggett spoke the spirit which animated him seemed to communicate itself to his listeners their eyes kindled and the keen joy that gallant men always feel in the anticipation of conflict flushed their faces i am a son of leonidas said george stefanopolous proudly and he secreted not merely one but two of cleggett's daggers about his body in addition to the revolver given him as george had already possessed a dagger or two and an automatic pistol it was now almost impossible for him to lay his hand casually on any part of his person without its coming into contact with a deadly weapon ready for instant use cap'n abernethy picked up a cutlass hefted it thoughtfully rolled his sleeve back upon a lean and sinewy old arm that was tanned until it looked like a piece of weathered oak spat upon his hand and whirled the weapon till it whistled in the air i come of a seafarin fambly said the cap'n sententiously as for kuroki he said nothing he was not given to speech at any time but he picked up a malay kris and ran his thumb along the edge of it critically like a man to whom such a weapon is not altogether unfamiliar a pleased smile stole over his face he handled the wicked knife almost affectionately he put it down with a little loving pat brave boys murmured cleggett as he watched them he smiled but at the same time something like a tear blurred his eloquent and magnetic eye for a moment brave boys he murmured we were made for each other the display of the american flag by the jasper b had an effect that could not have been foreseen almost immediately the annabel lee herself flung an exactly similar american flag to the breeze but a strange thing happened at morris's an american flag was first hung from an upper window over the east verandah then after a moment it was withdrawn then a red flag was put out but almost immediately cleggett saw a man rip the red flag from its fastenings and fling it to the ground cleggett resorting to his glass perceived that it was the tall man with the stoop shoulders and incongruous clothing who had torn down the red flag he was now in violent altercation with the man who had hung it out the fellow whom he had called heinrich some days before as cleggett watched the two men came to blows then they clinched and struggled swaying back and forth within the open window like a moving picture in a frame suddenly the tall fellow seemed to get the upper hand exerting all his strength he bent the other backward over the window sill the two contending figures writhed desperately a moment and then the tall man shifted one powerful sinewy hand to heinrich's throat the binoculars brought the thing so near to cleggett that it seemed as if he could touch the contorted faces he could see the tall man's neck muscles work as if that person were panting he could see the signs of suffocation in heinrich's countenance the fact that he saw so plainly and yet could hear no sound of the struggle somehow added to its horror all at once the tall man put his knee upon the other's chest and flung his weight upon heinrich with a vehement spring then he tumbled heinrich out of the window onto the roof of the verandah he stepped out of the window himself picked heinrich up with an ease that testified to his immense strength and flung him over the edge of the verandah onto the ground a few moments later a couple of men ran out from morris's busied themselves about reviving the fellow and helped him into the house if heinrich was not badly injured certainly all the fight had been taken out of him for one day with heinrich thus disposed of the tall man turned composedly to the task of putting out the american flag again through the glass cleggett perceived that his face was twisted by a peculiar smile a smile of joyous malevolence a bad man to cross that tall man said cleggett musingly and indeed his violence with heinrich had seemed out of all proportion to the apparent grounds of the quarrel for it was evident to cleggett that heinrich and the tall man had differed merely about the policy of displaying the red flag a man determined to have his way mused cleggett if he and i should meet cleggett did not finish the sentence in words but his hand closed over the butt of his revolver his musing was interrupted by the noise of an approaching automobile turning he saw a vehicle the rather long body of which was covered so that it resembled a merchant's delivery wagon coming along the road from fairport it stopped opposite the jasper b and from the seat beside the driver leaped lightly the most beautiful woman cleggett had ever seen and walked hesitatingly but gracefully towards him she was agitated she was in fact sobbing and a pomeranian dog which she carried in her arms was whimpering excitedly as if in sympathy with its mistress cleggett soul of chivalry that he was born cavalier of beauty in distress removed his hat and advanced to meet her chapter v beauty in distress can you tell me where i can get some ice can you sell me some ice cried the lady excitedly when she was still some yards distant from cleggett ice the request was so unusual that cleggett was not certain that he had understood yes ice ice there was no mistaking the genuine character of her eagerness if she had been begging for her life she could not have been more in earnest don't tell me that you have none on your boat don't tell me that don't tell me that and suddenly like a woman who has borne all that she can bear she burst undisguisedly into a paroxysm of weeping cleggett stirred by her beauty and her trouble stepped nearer to her for she swayed with her emotion as if she were about to fall impulsively she put a hand on his arm and the pomeranian dropped unceremoniously to the ground sprang at cleggett snarling and snapping as if sure he were the author of the lady's misfortunes you will think i am mad said the lady endeavoring to control her tears but i must have ice don't tell me that you have no ice my dear lady said cleggett unconsciously clasping in his anxiety to reassure her the hand that she had laid upon his arm i have ice you shall have all the ice you want oh she murmured leaning towards him you cannot know but the rest was lost in an incoherent babble and with a deep sigh she fell lax into cleggett's arms the reaction from despair had been too much for her it had come too suddenly at the first word of reassurance at the first ray of dawning hope she had fainted high strung natures intrepid in the face of danger are apt to such collapses in the moment of deliverance and whatever the nature of the lady's trouble cleggett gained from her swoon a sharp sense of its intensity cleggett was not used to having beautiful women faint and fall into his arms and he was too much of a gentleman to hold one there a single moment longer than was absolutely necessary he turned his head rather helplessly towards the vehicle in which the lady had arrived to his consternation and surprise it had turned around and the chauffeur was in the act of starting back towards fairport but he had left behind him a large zinc bucket with a cover on it a long unpainted oblong box and two steamer trunks on the oblong box sat a short squat young man in an attitude of deep dejection hi there stop cried cleggett to the chauffeur that person stopped his machine he did more he arose in the seat applied his thumb to his nose and vigorously and vivaciously waggled his outspread fingers at cleggett in a gesture derisive and inelegant that is older than the pyramids then he started his machine again and made all speed in the direction of fairport i say you come here cleggett called to the squat young man can't you see that the lady's fainted the squat young man thus exhorted sadly approached can't you see the lady has fainted repeated cleggett skoits often does said the squat young man looking over the situation in a detached judicial manner he spoke out of the left corner of his mouth in a hoarse voice without moving the right side of his face at all and he seemed to feel"
