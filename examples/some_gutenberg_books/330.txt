nice little red haired child minnie how old is this young carter twenty three an er earnest youth willing to buckle down to work and make the old place go ready to pat the old ladies on the shoulder and squeeze the young ones hands he's young i said but if you're counting on his being a fool not at all he broke in hastily if he hasn't too much character he'll probably succeed i hope he isn't a fool if he isn't oh friend minnie he'll stand the atmosphere of this garden of souls for about a week and then he'll kill some of them and escape where is he now he's been sick i said mumps mumps oh my aunt he exclaimed and fell to laughing he was still laughing when he got to the door mumps he repeated with his hand on the knob minnie the old place will be under the hammer in three weeks and if you know what's good for you you'll sign in under the new management while there's a vacancy you've been the whole show here for so long that it will be hard for you to line up in the back row of the chorus if i were you i said looking him straight in the eye i wouldn't pick out any new carpets yet mr thoburn i promised the old doctor i'd help mr dick and i will so you're actually going to fight it out he said grinning well the odds are in your favor you are two to my one i think it's pretty even i retorted we will be hindered so to speak by having certain principles of honor and honesty you have no handicap he tried to think of a retort and not finding one he slammed out of the spring house in a rage mr van alstyne and his wife came in that same day just before dinner and we played three handed bridge for half an hour as i've said they'd been on their honeymoon and they were both sulky at having to stay at the springs it was particularly hard on mrs van alstyne because with seven trunks of trousseau with her she had to put on black but she used to shut herself up in her room in the evenings and deck out for mr sam in her best things we found it out one evening when mrs biggs set fire to her bureau cover with her alcohol curling iron heater and mrs sam who had been going around in a black crepe dress all day rushed out in pink satin with crystal trimming and slippers with cut glass heels after the first rubber mrs van alstyne threw her cards on the floor and said another day like this would finish her surely dick is able to come now she said like a peevish child didn't he say the swelling was all gone do you expect me to pick up those cards mr sam asked angrily looking at her mrs sam yawned and looked up at him of course i do she answered if it wasn't for you i'd not have stayed a moment after the funeral isn't it bad enough to have seven trunks full of clothes i've never worn and to have to put on poky old black without keeping me here in this old ladies home mr sam looked at the cards and then at her i'm not going to pick them up he declared and as to our staying here don't you realize that if we don't your precious brother will never show up here at all or stay if he does come and don't you also realize that this is probably the only chance he'll ever have in the world to become financially independent of us you needn't be brutal she said sharply and it isn't so bad for you here as it is for me you spend every waking minute admiring miss jennings while i there isn't a man in the place who'll talk anything but his joints or his stomach she got up and went to the window and mr sam followed her nobody pays any attention to me in the spring house i'm a part of it like the brass rail around the spring or the clock i'm not admiring miss jennings he corrected i'm sympathizing dear she looks too nice a girl to have been stung by the title bee that's all she turned her back to him but he pretended to tuck the hair at the back of her neck up under her comb and she let him do it as i stooped to gather up the cards he kissed the tip of her ear listen he said there's a scream of a play down at finleyville to night called sweet peas senator biggs and the bishop went down last night and they say it's the worst in twenty years put on a black veil and let's slip away and see it i think she agreed to do it but that night after dinner amanda king who has charge of the news stand told me the sheriff had closed the opera house and that the leading woman was sick at the hotel they say she looked funny last night amanda finished and i guess she's got the mumps mumps my joint gave a throb at that minute chapter iv and a way mr sam wasn't taking any chances for the next day he went to the city himself to bring mr dick up everything was quiet that day and the day after except that on the second day i had a difference of opinion with the house doctor and he left the story of the will had got out of course and the guests were waiting to see mr dick come and take charge i got a good bit of gossip from miss cobb who had had her hair cut short after a fever and used to come out early in the morning and curl it all over her head heating the curler on the fire log i never smell burnt hair that i don't think of miss cobb trying to do the back of her neck she was one of our regulars and every winter for ten years she'd read me the letters she had got from an insurance agent who'd run away with a married woman the day before the wedding she kept them in a bundle tied with lavender ribbon it was on the third day i think that miss cobb told me that miss patty and her father had had a quarrel the day before she got it from one of the chambermaids mr jennings was a liver case and not pleasant at any time but he had been worse than usual annie the chambermaid told miss cobb that the trouble was about settlements and that the more miss patty tried to tell him it was the european custom the worse he got miss patty hadn't come down to breakfast that day and mr moody and senator biggs made a wager in the turkish bath according to miss cobb mr moody betting the wedding wouldn't come off at all of course miss cobb said wetting her finger and trying the iron to see if it was hot of course minnie they're not married yet and if father jennings gets ugly and makes any sort of scandal it's all off a scandal just now would be fatal these royalties are very touchy about other people's reputations well i heard that often enough in the next few days mr sam hadn't come back by the morning of the sixth day but he wired his wife the day before that mr dick was on the way but we met every train with a sleigh and he didn't come i was uneasy knowing mr dick and mrs sam was worried too by that time everybody was waiting and watching and on the early train on the sixth day came the lawyer a mr stitt mr thoburn was going around with a sort of greasy smile and if i could have poisoned him safely i'd have done it it had been snowing hard for a day or so and at eleven o'clock that day i saw miss cobb and mrs biggs coming down the path to the spring house mrs biggs with her crocheting bag hanging to the handle of her umbrella i opened the door but they wouldn't come in we won't track up your clean floor minnie mrs biggs said she was a little woman almost fifty who'd gone through life convinced she'd only lived so long by the care she took of herself but i thought i'd better come and speak to you please don't irritate mr biggs to day he's been reading that article of upton sinclair's about fasting and hasn't had a bite to eat since noon yesterday i noticed then that she looked pale she was a nervous creature although she could drink more spring water than any human being i ever saw except one man and he was a german well i promised to be careful i've seen them fast before and when a fat man starts to live on his own fat like a bear he gets about the same disposition mrs biggs started back but miss cobb waited a moment at the foot of the steps mr van alstyne is back she said but he came alone alone i repeated staring at her in a sort of daze alone she said solemnly and i heard him ask for mr carter it seems he started for here yesterday but i'd had time to get myself in hand and if i had a chill up my spine she never knew it as she started after mrs biggs i saw mr sam hurrying down the path toward the spring house and i knew my joint hadn't throbbed for nothing mr sam came in and slammed the door behind him what's this about mr dick not being here he shouted well he isn't that's all there is to it mr van alstyne i said calmly i am always calm when other people get excited for that reason some people think my red hair is a false alarm but they soon find out but he must be here said mr van alstyne i put him on the train myself yesterday and waited until it started to be sure he was off the only way to get mr richard anywhere you want him to go i said dryly is to have him nailed in a crate and labeled damned young scamp said mr van alstyne although i have a sign in the spring house profanity not allowed exactly what was he doing when you last laid eyes on him i asked he was on the train was he alone yes sitting no standing what the deuce minnie waving out the window to you of course not exclaimed mr van alstyne testily he was raising the window for a girl in the next seat precisely i said would you know the girl well enough to trace her that's ridiculous you know he said trying to be polite out of a thousand and one things that may have detained him only one thing ever detains mr dick and that always detains him i said solemnly that's a girl you're a newcomer in the family mr van alstyne you don't remember the time he went down here to the station to see his aunt agnes off to the city and we found him three weeks later in oklahoma trying to marry a widow with five children mr van alstyne dropped into a chair and through force of habit i gave him a glass of spring water this was a pretty girl too he said dismally i sat down on the other side of the fireplace and it seemed to me that father's crayon enlargement over the mantel shook its head at me after a minute mr van alstyne drank the water and got up i'll have to tell my wife he said who's running the place anyhow you not exactly i explained but of course when anything comes up they consult me the housekeeper is a fool and now that the house doctor's gone gone who's looking after the patients well most of them have been here before i explained and i know their treatment the kind of baths and all that oh you know the treatment he said eying me and why did the house doctor go he ordered mr moody to take his spring water hot mr moody's spring water has been ordered cold for eleven years and i refused to change it was between the doctor and me mr van alstyne oh of course he said if it was a matter of principle he stopped and then something seemed to strike him i say he said about the doctor that's all right you know lots of doctors and all that but for heaven's sake minnie don't discharge the cook now that was queer for it had been running in my head all morning that in the slack season it would be cheaper to get a good woman instead of the chef and let tillie the diet cook make the pastry mr sam picked up his hat and looked at his watch eleven thirty he said and no sign of that puppy yet i guess it's up to the police if there was only something to do i said with a lump in my throat but to have to sit and do nothing while the old place dies it's it's awful mr van alstyne we're not dead yet he replied from the door and maybe we'll need you before the day's over if anybody can sail the old bark to shore you can do it minnie you've been steering it for years the old doctor was no navigator and you and i know it it was blowing a blizzard by that time and miss patty was the only one who came out to the spring house until after three o'clock she shook the snow off her furs and stood by the fire looking at me and not saying anything for fully a minute well she said finally aren't you ashamed of yourself why i asked and swallowed hard to be in all this trouble and not let me know i've just this minute heard about it can't we get the police mr van alstyne is trying i said but i don't hope much like as not mr dick will turn up tomorrow and say his calendar was a day slow i gave her a glass of water and i noticed when she took it how pale she was but she held it up and smiled over it at me here's to everything turning out better than we expect she said and made a face as she drank the water i thought that she was thinking of her own troubles as well as mine for she put down the glass and stood looking at her engagement ring a square red ruby in an old fashioned setting it was a very large ruby but i've seen showier rings there isn't anything wrong miss patty is there i asked and she dropped her hand and looked at me oh no she said that is nothing much minnie father is i think he's rather ridiculous about some things but i dare say he'll come around i don't mind his fussing with me but if it should get in the papers minnie a breath of unpleasant notoriety now would be fatal i don't see why i said sharply the royal families of europe have a good bit of unpleasant notoriety themselves occasionally i should think they'd fall over themselves to get some good red american blood blue blood's bad blood you can ask any doctor but she only smiled you're like father minnie she said you'll never understand i'm not sure i want to i snapped and fell to polishing glasses the storm stopped a little at three and most of the guests waded down through the snow for bridge and spring water by that time the afternoon train was in and no mr dick mr sam was keeping the lawyer mr stitt in the billiard room and by four o'clock they'd had everything that was in the bar and were inventing new combinations of their own and mrs sam had gone to bed with a nervous headache senator biggs brought the mail down to the spring house at four but there was nothing for me except a note from mr sam rather shaky which said he'd no word yet and that mr stitt had mixed all the cordials in the bar in a beer glass and had had to go to bed at half past four mr thoburn came out for a minute he said there was only one other train from town that night and the chances were it would be snowed up at the junction better get on the band wagon before the parade's gone past he said in an undertone but i went into my pantry and shut the door with a slam and when i came out he was gone i nearly went crazy that afternoon i put salt in miss cobb's glass when she always drank the water plain once i put the broom in the fire and started to sweep the porch with a fire log luckily they were busy with their letters and it went unnoticed the smell of burning straw not rising so to speak above the sulphur in the spring senator biggs went from one table to another telling how well he felt since he stopped eating and trying to coax the other men to starve with him it's funny how a man with a theory about his stomach isn't happy until he has made some other fellow swallow it well he said standing in front of the fire with a glass of water in his hand it's worth while to feel like this my head's as clear as a bell i don't care to eat i don't want to eat the fast is the solution two stages to that solution senator said the bishop first resolution last dissolution then they all began at once if you have ever heard twenty people airing their theories on diet you know all about it one shouts for horace fletcher and another one swears by the scraped beef treatment and somebody else never touches a thing but raw eggs and milk and pretty soon there is a riot of calories and carbohydrates it always ends the same way the man with the loudest voice wins and the defeated ones limp over to the spring and tell their theories to me they know i'm being paid to listen on this particular afternoon the bishop stopped the riot by rising and holding up his hand ladies and gentlemen he said let us not be rancorous if each of us has a theory and that theory works out to his satisfaction then why are we all here merely to tell one another the good news mr jennings said sourly from his corner honest it was funny if some folks were healthy they'd be lonesome but when things had got quiet except mr moody dropping nickels into the slot machine i happened to look over at miss patty and i saw there was something wrong she had a letter open in her lap not one of the blue ones with the black and gold seal that every one in the house knew came from the prince but a white one and she was staring at it as if she'd seen a ghost chapter v wanted an owner i have never reproached miss patty but if she had only given me the letter to read or had told me the whole truth instead of a part of it i would have understood and things would all have been different it is all very well for her to say that i looked worried enough already and that anyhow it was a family affair i should have been told all she did was to come up to me as i stood in the spring with her face perfectly white and ask me if my dicky carter was the richard carter who stayed at the grosvenor in town he doesn't stay anywhere i said with my feet getting cold but that's where he has apartments what has he been doing now you're expecting him on the evening train aren't you she asked don't stare like that my father's watching he ought to be on the evening train i said i wasn't going to say i expected him i didn't listen minnie she said you'll have to send him away again the moment he comes he must not go into the house i stood looking at her with my mouth open not go into the house i repeated with everybody waiting for him for the last six days and mr stitt here to turn things over to him she stood tapping her foot with her pretty brows knitted the wretch she cried the hateful creature as if things weren't bad enough i suppose he'll have to come minnie but i must see him before he sees any one else just then the bishop brought his glass over to the spring hot this time minnie he said do you know i'm getting the mineral water habit patty i'm afraid plain water will have no attraction for me after this he put his hand over hers on the rail they were old friends the bishop and the jenningses well how goes it to day with the father he said in a low tone and smiling miss patty shrugged her shoulders worse if possible i thought so he said cheerfully if state of mind is any criterion i should think he has had a relapse a little salt minnie miss patty stood watching him while he tasted it bishop she said suddenly will you do something for me i always have patty he was very fond of miss patty was the bishop then to night not later than eight o'clock get father to play cribbage will you and keep him in the card room until nine another escapade he said pretending to be very serious patty patty you'll be the death of me yet is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing certainly not said miss patty just a dear slightly bald but still very distinguished slave the bishop picked up her left hand and looked at the ring and from that to her face there will be plenty of slaves to kiss this little hand where you are going my child he said sometimes i wish that some nice red blooded boy here at home but i dare say it will turn out surprisingly well as it is bishop bishop mrs moody called how naughty of you and with your bridge hand waiting to be held he carried his glass back to the table stopping for a moment beside mr jennings if patty becomes any more beautiful he said i shall be in favor of having her wear a mask how are we young men to protect ourselves pretty is as pretty does declared mr jennings from behind his newspaper and miss patty went out with her chin up well i knew mr dick had been up to some mischief i had suspected it all along but miss patty went to bed and old mrs hutchins who's a sort of lady's maid companion of hers said she mustn't be disturbed i was pretty nearly sick myself and when mr sam came out at five o'clock and said he'd been in the long distance telephone booth for an hour and had called everybody who had ever known mr dick and that he had dropped right off the earth i just about gave up he had got some detectives he said and there was some sort of a story about his having kept right on the train to salem ohio but if he had they'd lost the trail there and anyhow with the railroad service tied up by the storm there wasn't much chance of his getting to finleyville in time luckily mr stitt was in bed with a mustard leaf over his stomach and ice on his head and didn't know whether it was night or morning but thoburn was going around with a watch in his hand and mr sam was for killing him and burying the body in the snow at half past five i just about gave up i was sitting in front of the fire wondering why i'd taken influenza the spring before from getting my feet wet in a shower when i had been standing in a mineral spring for so many years that it's a wonder i'm not web footed it was when i had influenza that the old doctor made the will you remember maybe i was crying i don't recall it was dark outside and nothing inside but firelight suddenly i seemed to feel somebody looking at the back of my neck and i turned around there was a man standing outside one of the windows staring in my first thought of course was that it was mr dick but just as the face vanished i saw that it wasn't it was older by three or four years than mr dick's and a bit fuller i'm not nervous i've had to hold my own against chronic grouches too long to have nerves so i went to the door and looked out the man came around the corner just then and i could see him plainly in the firelight he was covered with snow and he wore a sweater and no overcoat but he looked like a gentleman i beg your pardon for spying he said but the fire looked so snug i've been trying to get to the hotel over there but in the dark i've lost the path that's not a hotel i snapped for that touched me on the raw that's hope springs sanatorium and this is one of the springs oh hope springs internal instead of eternal he said that's awfully bad isn't it to tell you the truth i think i'd better come in and get some i'm short on hope just now i thought that was likely enough for although his voice was cheerful and his eyes smiled there was a drawn look around his mouth and he hadn't shaved that day i wish i had had as much experience in learning what's right with folks as i have had in learning what's wrong with them you'd better come in and get warm anyhow i told him only don't spring any more gags i've been hebe for fourteen years and i've served all the fancy drinks you can name over the brass railing of that spring nowadays when a fellow gets smart and asks for a mamie taylor i charge him a mamie taylor price he shut the door behind him and came over to the fire i'm pretty well frozen he said don't be astonished if i melt before your eyes i've been walking for hours now that i had a better chance to see him i'd sized up that drawn look around his mouth missed your luncheon i suppose i said poking the fire log he grinned rather sheepishly well i haven't had any and i've certainly missed it he said fasting's healthy you know i thought of senator biggs who carried enough fat to nourish him for months and then i looked at my visitor who hadn't an ounce of extra flesh on him nothing's healthy that isn't natural i declared if you'd care for a dish of buttered and salted pop corn there's some on the mantel it's pretty salty the idea is to make folks thirsty so they'll enjoy the mineral water think of raising a real thirst only to drown it with spring water he said but he got the pop corn and he ate it all if he hadn't had any luncheon he hadn't had much breakfast the queer part was he was a gentleman his clothes were the right sort but he had on patent leather shoes in all that snow and an automobile cap i put away the glasses while he ate pretty soon he looked up and the drawn lines were gone he wasn't like mr dick but he was the same type only taller and heavier built and so it isn't a hotel he remarked well i'm sorry the caravansary in the village is not to my liking and i had thought of engaging a suite up here my secretary usually attends to these things but don't take away all the glasses heb i beg your pardon but the thirst is coming he filled the glass himself and then he came up and stood in front of me with the glass held up in the air to the best woman i have met in many days he said not mocking but serious i was about to lie down and let the little birds cover me with leaves then he glanced at the empty dish and smiled to buttered pop corn long may it wave he said and emptied the glass well i found a couple"
