"1" "quickly wasn't that exactly what she did the first time he ever came here got laura to play and made him think it was _her_ didn't she oh just in fun mrs madison's tone lacked conviction she turned a little confusedly from the glaring boy and fumbled among the silver on the kitchen table besides she told him afterward that it was laura he walked in on her one day when she was battin away at the piano herself with her back to the door then she pretended it had been a joke and he was so far gone by that time he didn't care he's crazy anyway added the youth casually who is this corliss he owns this house his family were early settlers and used to be very prominent but they're all dead except this one his mother was a widow she went abroad to live and took him with her when he was about your age and i don't think he's ever been back since did he use to live in this house no an aunt of his did she left it to him when she died two years ago your father was agent for her you think this corliss wants to sell it it's been for sale all the time he's owned it that's why we moved here it made the rent low is he rich they used to have money but maybe it's all spent it seemed to me he might want to raise money on the house because i don't see any other reason that could bring him back here he's already mortgaged it pretty heavily your father told me i don't mrs madison paused abruptly her eyes widening at a dismaying thought oh i do hope your father will know better than to ask him to stay to dinner hedrick's expression became cryptic father won't ask him he said but i'll bet you a thousand dollars he stays the mother followed her son's thought and did not seek to elicit verbal explanation of the certainty which justified so large a venture oh i hope not she said sarah's threatening to leave anyway and she gets so cross if there's extra cooking on wash days well sarah'll have to get cross said the boy grimly and _i_ ll have to plug out and go for a quart of brick ice cream and carry it home in all this heat and laura and you'll have to stand over the stove with sarah and father'll have to change his shirt and we'll all have to toil and moil and sweat and suffer while cora lee sits out on the front porch and talks toodle do dums to her new duke and then she'll have _you_ go out and kid him along while _hedrick_ yes you will while she gets herself all dressed and powdered up again after that she'll do her share of the work she'll strain her poor back carryin dick lindley's flowers down the back stairs and stickin em in a vase over a hole in the tablecloth that laura hasn't had time to sew up you wait and see the gloomy realism of this prophecy was not without effect upon the seer's mother oh no she exclaimed protestingly we really can't manage it i'm sure cora won't want to ask him you'll see no i'm sure she wouldn't think of it but if she does i'll tell her we can't we really can't to day her son looked pityingly upon her she ought to be _my daughter he said the sinister implication all too plain just about five minutes with that he effectively closed the interview and left her he returned to his abandoned art labours in the conservatory and meditatively perpetrated monstrosities upon the tiles for the next half hour at the end of which he concealed his box of chalks with an anxiety possibly not unwarranted beneath the sideboard and made his way toward the front door first glancing unseen into the kitchen where his mother still pursued the silver he walked through the hall on tiptoe taking care to step upon the much stained and worn strip of turkish carpet and not upon the more resonant wooden floor the music had ceased long since the open doorway was like a brilliantly painted picture hung upon the darkness of the hall though its human centre of interest was no startling bit of work consisting of mr madison pottering aimlessly about the sun flooded unkempt lawn fanning himself and now and then stooping to pull up one of the thousands of plantain weeds that beset the grass with him the little spy had no concern but from a part of the porch out of sight from the hall came cora's exquisite voice and the light and pleasant baritone of the visitor hedrick flattened himself in a corner just inside the door i should break any engagement whatsoever if i had one mr corliss was saying with what the eavesdropper considered an offensively foreign accent and an equally unjustifiable gallantry but of course i haven't i am so utterly a stranger here your mother is immensely hospitable to wish you to ask me and i'll be only too glad to stay perhaps after dinner you'll be very very kind and play again of course you know how remarkable such oh just improvising cora tossed off carelessly with a deprecatory ripple of laughter it's purely with the mood you see i can't make myself do things no i fancy i shall not play again today there was a moment's silence shan't i fasten that in your buttonhole for you said cora you see how patiently i've been awaiting the offer there was another little silence and the listener was able to construct a picture possibly in part from an active memory of cora's delicate hands uplifted to the gentleman's lapel and cora's eyes for a moment likewise uplifted yes one has moods she said dreamily i am _all_ moods i think you are too mr corliss you _look_ moody aren't you a horrible grin might have been seen to disfigure the shadow in the corner just within the doorway chapter three it was cooler outdoors after dinner in the dusk of that evening nevertheless three members of the madison family denied themselves the breeze and as by a tacitly recognized and habitual house rule so disposed themselves as to afford the most agreeable isolation for the younger daughter and the guest who occupied wicker chairs upon the porch the mother and father sat beneath a hot gas droplight in the small library mrs madison with an evening newspaper her husband with king solomon's mines and laura after crisply declining an urgent request from hedrick to play had disappeared upstairs the inimical lad alone was inspired for the ungrateful role of duenna he sat upon the topmost of the porch steps with the air of being permanently implanted leaning forward elbows on knees cheeks on palms in a treacherous affectation of profound reverie and his back all of him that was plainly visible in the hall light tauntingly close to a delicate foot which would god wot willingly have launched him into the darkness beyond it was his dreadful pleasure to understand wholly the itching of that shapely silk and satin foot the gas light from the hall laid a broad orange path to the steps cora and her companion sat just beyond it his whiteness gray and she a pale ethereality in the shadow she wore an evening gown that revealed a vague lilac through white and shimmered upon her like a vapour she was very quiet and there was a wan sweetness about her an exhalation of wistfulness cora in the evening was more like a rose than ever she was fragrant in the dusk the spell she cast was an undine's it was not to be thought so exquisite a thing as she could last and who may know how she managed to say what she did in the silence and darkness for it was said without words without touch even without a look as plainly as if she had spoken or written the message if i am a rose i am one to be worn and borne away are you the man with the fall of night the street they faced had become still save for an infrequent squawk of irritation on the part of one of the passing automobiles gadding for the most part silently like fireflies but after a time a strolling trio of negroes came singing along the sidewalk in the evening by the moonlight you could hear those banjos ringing in the evening by the moonlight you could hear those darkies singing how the ole folks would injoy it they would sit all night an lis sun as we sang i i n the evening by y y the moonlight ah _that_ takes me back exclaimed corliss that's as it used to be i might be a boy again and i suppose this old house has many memories for you said cora softly not very many my old maid aunt didn't like me overmuch i believe and i wasn't here often my mother and i lived far down the street a big apartment house stands there now i noticed as i was walking out here this afternoon the verema it is called absurdly enough ray vilas lives there volunteered hedrick not altering his position vilas said the visitor politely with a casual recollection that the name had been once or twice emphasized by the youth at dinner i don't remember vilas among the old names here it wasn't i guess said hedrick ray vilas has only been here about two years he came from kentucky a great friend of yours i suppose he ain't a boy said hedrick and returned to silence without further explanation how cool and kind the stars are to night said cora very gently she leaned forward from her chair extending a white arm along the iron railing of the porch bending toward corliss and speaking toward him and away from hedrick in as low a voice as possible probably entertaining a reasonable hope of not being overheard i love things that are cool and kind she said i love things that are cool and strong i love iron she moved her arm caressingly upon the railing i love its cool smooth touch any strong life must have iron in it i like iron in men she leaned a very little closer to him have you iron in you mr corliss she asked at these words the frayed edge of hedrick's broad white collar was lifted perceptibly from his coat as if by a shudder passing over the back and shoulders beneath if i have not answered corliss in a low voice i will have now tell me about yourself she said dear lady he began and it was an effective beginning for a sigh of pleasure parted her lips as he spoke there is nothing interesting to tell i have spent a very commonplace life i think not you shouldn't call any life commonplace that has escaped _this_ the lovely voice was all the richer for the pain that shook it now this monotony this unending desert of ashes this death in life this town you mean this prison i mean everything tell me what lies outside of it you can what makes you think i can i don't need to answer that you understand perfectly valentine corliss drew in his breath with a sound murmurous of delight and for a time they did not speak yes he said finally i think i do there are meetings in the desert he went on slowly a lonely traveller finds another at a spring sometimes and sometimes they find that they speak the same language his answer came almost in a whisper even as you and i even as you and i she echoed even more faintly yes cora breathed rapidly in the silence that followed she had every appearance of a woman deeply and mysteriously stirred her companion watched her keenly in the dusk and whatever the reciprocal symptoms of emotion he may have exhibited they were far from tumultuous bearing more likeness to the quiet satisfaction of a good card player taking what may prove to be a decisive trick after a time she leaned back in her chair again and began to fan herself slowly you have lived in the orient haven't you mr corliss she said in an ordinary tone not lived i've been east once or twice i spend a greater part of the year at posilipo where is that on the fringe of naples do you live in a hotel no a slight surprise sounded in his voice i have a villa there do you know what that seems to me cora asked gravely after a pause then answered herself after another like magic like a strange beautiful dream yes it is beautiful he said then tell me what do you do there i spend a lot of time on the water in a boat sailing on sapphires and emeralds and turquoises and rubies melted and blown into waves and you go yachting over that glory fishing with my crew and loafing but your boat is really a yacht isn't it oh it might be called anything he laughed and your sailors are italian fishermen hedrick slew a mosquito upon his temple smiting himself hard no they're chinese he muttered hoarsely they're neapolitans said corliss do they wear red sashes and earrings asked cora one of them wears earrings and a derby hat ah she protested turning to him again you don't tell me you let me cross question you but you don't tell me things don't you see i want to know what _life_ is i want to know of strange seas of strange people of pain and of danger of great music of curious thoughts what are the neapolitan women like they fade early she leaned closer to him before the fading have you have you loved many all the pretty ones i ever saw he answered gayly but with something in his tone as there was in hers which implied that all the time they were really talking of things other than those spoken yet here this secret subject seemed to come near the surface she let him hear a genuine little snap of her teeth i _thought_ you were like that he laughed ah but you were sure to see it you could a seen a neapolitan woman yesterday cora said hedrick obligingly if you'd looked out the front window she was working a hurdy gurdy up and down this neighbourhood all afternoon he turned genially to face his sister and added ray vilas used to say there were lots of pretty girls in lexington cora sprang to her feet you're not smoking she said to corliss hurriedly as upon a sudden discovery let me get you some matches she had entered the house before he could protest and hedrick looking down the hall was acutely aware that she dived desperately into the library but however tragic the cry for justice she uttered there it certainly was not prolonged and the almost instantaneous quickness of her reappearance upon the porch with matches in her hand made this one of the occasions when her brother had to admit that in her own line cora was a miracle so thoughtless of me she said cheerfully resuming her seat she dropped the matches into mr corliss's hand with a fleeting touch of her finger tips upon his palm of course you wanted to smoke i can't think why i didn't realize it before i must have a voice called from within commanding in no uncertain tones hedrick i should like to see you hedrick rose and looking neither to the right nor to the left went stonily into the house and appeared before the powers call me he inquired with the air of cheerful readiness to proceed upon any errand no matter how difficult mr madison countered diplomacy with gloom i don't know what to do with you why can't you let your sister alone has laura been complaining of me oh hedrick said mrs madison hedrick himself felt the justice of her reproof his reference to laura was poor work he knew he hung his head and began to scrape the carpet with the side of his shoe well what'd cora say i been doing to her you know perfectly well what you've been doing said mr madison sharply nothing at all just sitting on the steps what'd she _say_ his father evidently considered it wiser not to repeat the text of accusation you know what you did he said heavily oho hedrick's eyes became severe and his sire's evasively shifted from them you keep away from the porch said the father uneasily you mean what i said about ray vilas asked the boy both parents looked uncomfortable and mr madison turning a leaf in his book gave a mediocre imitation of an austere person resuming his reading after an impertinent interruption that's what you mean said the boy accusingly ray vilas just you keep away from that porch because i happened to mention ray vilas demanded hedrick you let your sister alone i got a right to know what she said haven't i there was no response which appeared to satisfy hedrick perfectly neither parent met his glance the mother troubled and the father dogged while the boy rejoiced sternly in some occult triumph he inflated his scant chest in pomp and hurled at the defeated pair the well known words i wish she was _my_ daughter about five minutes new sounds from without men's voices in greeting and a ripple of response from cora somewhat lacking in enthusiasm afforded mr madison unmistakable relief and an errand upon which to send his deadly offspring hedrick after a reconnaissance in the hall obeyed at leisure closing the library door nonchalantly behind him he found himself at the foot of a flight of unillumined back stairs where his manner underwent a swift alteration for here was an adventure to be gone about with ceremony ventre st gris he muttered hoarsely and loosened the long rapier in the shabby sheath at his side for with the closing of the door he had become a huguenot gentleman over forty and a little grizzled perhaps but modest and unassuming wiry alert lightning quick with a wrist of steel and a heart of gold and he was about to ascend the stairs of an unknown house at blois in total darkness he went up crouching ready for anything without a footfall not even causing a hideous creak and gained the top in safety here he turned into an obscure passage and at the end of it beheld through an open door a little room in which a dark eyed lady sat writing in a book by the light of an oil lamp the wary huguenot remained in the shadow and observed her laura was writing in an old ledger she had found in the attic blank and unused she had rebound it herself in heavy gray leather and fitted it with a tiny padlock and key she wore the key under her dress upon a very thin silver chain round her neck upon the first page of the book was written a date now more than a year past the month was june and beneath it love came to me to day nothing more was written upon that page chapter four laura at this writing looked piquantly unfamiliar to her brother her eyes were moist and bright her cheeks were flushed and as she bent low intently close to the book a loosened wavy strand of her dark hair almost touched the page hedrick had never before seen her wearing an expression so becoming as the eager and tremulous warmth of this though sometimes at the piano she would play in a reverie which wrought such glamour about her that even a brother was obliged to consider her rather handsome she looked more than handsome now so strangely lovely in fact that his eyes watered painfully with the protracted struggle to read a little of the writing in her book before she discovered him he gave it up at last and lounged forward blinking with the air of finding it sweet to do nothing whatch writin he asked in simple carelessness at the first sound of his movement she closed the book in a flash then with a startled protective gesture extended her arms over it covering it what is it hedrick she asked breathlessly what's the padlock for nothing she panted what is it you want you writin poetry laura's eyes dilated she looked dangerous oh i don't care about your old book said hedrick with an amused nonchalance talleyrand might have admired there's callers and you have to come down who sent you a man i've often noticed around the house he replied blightingly you may have seen him i think his name's madison his wife and he both sent for you one of laura's hands instinctively began to arrange her hair but the other remained upon the book who is it calling richard lindley and that wade trumble laura rose standing between her brother and the table tell mother i will come down hedrick moved a little nearer whereupon observing his eye she put her right hand behind her upon the book she was not deceived and boys are not only superb strategic actors sometimes but calamitously quick appearing to be unaware of her careful defence he leaned against the wall and crossed his feet in an original and interesting manner of course _you_ understand he said cosily cora wants to keep this corliss in a corner of the porch where she can coo at him so you and mother'll have to raise a ballyhoo for dick lindley and that wade trumble it'd been funny if dick hadn't noticed anybody was there and kissed her what on earth does he want to stay engaged to her for anyway you don't know that she is engaged to mr lindley hedrick get out he hooted what's the use talking like that to me a blind mackerel could see she's let poor old lindley think he's high man with her these last few months but he'll have to hit the pike now i reckon cause this corliss is altogether too pe rin sley for dick's class lee roy est mort vive lee roy hedrick won't you please run along i want to change my dress what for there was company for dinner and you didn't change then laura's flushed cheeks flushed deeper and in her confusion she answered too quickly i only have one evening gown i of course i can't wear it every night well then he returned triumphantly what do you want to put it on now for _please_ run along hedrick she pleaded you didn't for this corliss he persisted sharply you know dick lindley couldn't see anybody but cora to save his life and i don't suppose there's a girl on earth fool enough to dress up for that wade trum hedrick laura's voice rang with a warning which he remembered to have heard upon a few previous occasions when she had easily proved herself physically stronger than he go and tell mother i'm coming she said he began to whistle beulah land as he went but with the swift closing of the door behind him abandoned that pathetically optimistic hymn prematurely after the third bar twenty minutes later when laura came out and went downstairs a fine straight figure in her black evening gown the sieur de marsac that hard bitten huguenot whose middle aged shabbiness was but the outward and deceptive seeming of the longest head and the best sword in france emerged cautiously from the passageway and stood listening until her footsteps were heard descending the front stairs nevertheless the most painstaking search of her room a search as systematic as it was feverish failed to reveal where she had hidden the book he returned wearily to the porch a prophet has always been supposed to take some pleasure perhaps morbid in seeing his predictions fulfilled and it may have been a consolation to the gloomy heart of hedrick sorely injured by laura's offensive care of her treasure to find the grouping upon the porch as he had foretold cora and mr corliss sitting a little aloof from the others far enough to permit their holding an indistinct and murmurous conversation of their own their sequestration even by so short a distance gave them an appearance of intimacy which probably accounted for the rather absent greeting bestowed by mr lindley upon the son of the house who met him with some favour this richard lindley was a thin friendly looking young man with a pleasing old fashioned face which suggested that if he were minded to be portrayed it should be by the daguerreotype and that a high black stock would have been more suitable to him than his businesslike modern neck gear he had fine eyes which seemed habitually concerned with faraway things though when he looked at cora they sparkled however it cannot be said that the sparkling continued at its brightest when his glance wandered as it not infrequently did this evening from her lovely head to the rose in mr corliss's white coat hedrick resuming a position upon the top step between the two groups found the conversation of the larger annoying because it prevented him from hearing that of the smaller it was carried on for the greater part by his mother and mr trumble laura sat silent between these two and lindley's mood was obviously contemplative mr wade trumble twenty six small earnest and already beginning to lose his hair was talkative enough he was one of those people who are so continuously aggressive that they are negligible what's the matter here nobody pays any attention to me i'm important he might have had that legend engraved on his card it spoke from everything else that was his face voice gesture even from his clothes for they also clamoured for attention without receiving it worn by another man their extravagance of shape and shade might have advertised a self sacrificing effort for the picturesque but upon mr trumble they paradoxically confirmed an impression that he was well off and close certainly this was the impression confirmed in the mind of the shrewdest and most experienced observer on that veranda the accomplished valentine corliss was quite able to share cora's detachment satisfactorily and be very actively aware of other things at the same time for instance richard lindley's preoccupation had neither escaped him nor remained unconnected in his mind with that gentleman's somewhat attentive notice of the present position of a certain rose mr trumble took up mrs madison's placid weather talk as if it had been a flaunting challenge he made it a matter of conscience and for argument for he was a doughty champion it appeared when nothings were in question one of those stern men who will have accuracy in the banal insisting upon portent in talk meant to be slid over as mere courteous sound i don't know about that now he said with severe emphasis i don't know about that at all i can't say i agree with you in fact i do not agree with you it was hotter in the early part of july year before last than it has been at any time this summer several degrees hotter several degrees i fear i must beg to differ with you he said catching the poor lady again a moment later i beg to differ decidedly other places get a great deal more heat look at egypt permit me to disagree he interrupted her at once when she pathetically squirmed to another subject there's more than one side to this matter you are looking at this matter from a totally wrong angle let me inform you that statistics mrs madison's gentle voice was no more than just audible in the short intervals he permitted a blind listener would have thought mr trumble at the telephone hedrick was thankful when his mother finally gave up altogether the display of her ignorance inaccuracy and general misinformation and trumble talked alone that must have been the young man's object certainly he had struggled for it and so it must have pleased him he talked on and on and on he passed from one topic to another with no pause swinging over the gaps with a now you take or and that reminds me filling many a vacancy with so and so and so and so and other stencils while casting about for material to continue everything was italicized the significant and the trivial to the same monotone of emphasis death and shoe laces were all the same to him anything was all the same to him so long as he talked hedrick's irritation was gradually dispelled and becoming used to the sound he found it lulling relaxed his attitude and drowsed mr lindley was obviously lost in a reverie mrs madison her hand shading her eyes went over her market list for the morrow and otherwise set her house in order laura alone sat straight in her chair and her face was toward the vocalist but as she was in deep shadow her expression could not be guessed however one person in that group must have listened with genuine pleasure else why did he talk it was the returned native whose departure at last rang the curtain"
