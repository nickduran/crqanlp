hungry when as the night fell the prince caught sight of a light which seemed to shine from a cavern he rode up to it and saw a little old woman who appeared to be at least a hundred years old she put on her spectacles to look at prince hyacinth but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short the prince and the fairy for that was who she was had no sooner looked at one another than they went into fits of laughter and cried at the same moment oh what a funny nose not so funny as your own said prince hyacinth to the fairy but madam i beg you to leave the consideration of our noses such as they are and to be good enough to give me something to eat for i am starving and so is my poor horse with all my heart said the fairy though your nose is so ridiculous you are nevertheless the son of my best friend i loved your father as if he had been my brother now _he_ had a very handsome nose and pray what does mine lack said the prince oh it doesn't _lack_ anything replied the fairy on the contrary quite there is only too much of it but never mind one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long i was telling you that i was your father's friend he often came to see me in the old times and you must know that i was very pretty in those days at least he used to say so i should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time i ever saw him indeed said the prince when i have supped it will give me the greatest pleasure to hear it but consider madam i beg of you that i have had nothing to eat to day the poor boy is right said the fairy i was forgetting come in then and i will give you some supper and while you are eating i can tell you my story in a very few words for i don't like endless tales myself too long a tongue is worse than too long a nose and i remember when i was young that i was so much admired for not being a great chatterer they used to tell the queen my mother that it was so for though you see what i am now i was the daughter of a great king my father your father i dare say got something to eat when he was hungry interrupted the prince oh certainly answered the fairy and you also shall have supper directly i only just wanted to tell you but i really cannot listen to anything until i have had something to eat cried the prince who was getting quite angry but then remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the fairy's help he added i know that in the pleasure of listening to you i should quite forget my own hunger but my horse who cannot hear you must really be fed the fairy was very much flattered by this compliment and said calling to her servants you shall not wait another minute you are so polite and in spite of the enormous size of your nose you are really very agreeable plague take the old lady how she does go on about my nose said the prince to himself one would almost think that mine had taken all the extra length that hers lacks if i were not so hungry i would soon have done with this chatterpie who thinks she talks very little how stupid people are not to see their own faults that comes of being a princess she has been spoiled by flatterers who have made her believe that she is quite a moderate talker meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the table and the prince was much amused to hear the fairy who asked them a thousand questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself speak especially he noticed one maid who no matter what was being said always contrived to praise her mistress's wisdom well he thought as he ate his supper i'm very glad i came here this just shows me how sensible i have been in never listening to flatterers people of that sort praise us to our faces without shame and hide our faults or change them into virtues for my part i never will be taken in by them i know my own defects i hope poor prince hyacinth he really believed what he said and hadn't an idea that the people who had praised his nose were laughing at him just as the fairy's maid was laughing at her for the prince had seen her laugh slyly when she could do so without the fairy's noticing her however he said nothing and presently when his hunger began to be appeased the fairy said my dear prince might i beg you to move a little more that way for your nose casts such a shadow that i really cannot see what i have on my plate ah thanks now let us speak of your father when i went to his court he was only a little boy but that is forty years ago and i have been in this desolate place ever since tell me what goes on nowadays are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever in my time one saw them at parties theatres balls and promenades every day dear me _what_ a long nose you have i cannot get used to it really madam said the prince i wish you would leave off mentioning my nose it cannot matter to you what it is like i am quite satisfied with it and have no wish to have it shorter one must take what is given one now you are angry with me my poor hyacinth said the fairy and i assure you that i didn't mean to vex you on the contrary i wished to do you a service however though i really cannot help your nose being a shock to me i will try not to say anything about it i will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose to tell the truth it would make three reasonable ones the prince who was no longer hungry grew so impatient at the fairy's continual remarks about his nose that at last he threw himself upon his horse and rode hastily away but wherever he came in his journeyings he thought the people were mad for they all talked of his nose and yet he could not bring himself to admit that it was too long he had been so used all his life to hear it called handsome the old fairy who wished to make him happy at last hit upon a plan she shut the dear little princess up in a palace of crystal and put this palace down where the prince would not fail to find it his joy at seeing the princess again was extreme and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly in despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the dear little princess who on her part stretched out her hand that he might kiss it but turn which way he might he never could raise it to his lips for his long nose always prevented it for the first time he realized how long it really was and exclaimed well it must be admitted that my nose _is_ too long in an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters and the old fairy taking the dear little princess by the hand said to the prince now say if you are not very much obliged to me much good it was for me to talk to you about your nose you would never have found out how extraordinary it was if it hadn't hindered you from doing what you wanted to you see how self love keeps us from knowing our own defects of mind and body our reason tries in vain to show them to us we refuse to see them till we find them in the way of our interests prince hyacinth whose nose was now just like anyone's else did not fail to profit by the lesson he had received he married the dear little princess and they lived happily ever after 1 1 le prince desir et la princesse mignonne par madame leprince de beaumont east of the sun and west of the moon once upon a time there was a poor husbandman who had many children and little to give them in the way either of food or clothing they were all pretty but the prettiest of all was the youngest daughter who was so beautiful that there were no bounds to her beauty so once it was late on a thursday evening in autumn and wild weather outside terribly dark and raining so heavily and blowing so hard that the walls of the cottage shook again they were all sitting together by the fireside each of them busy with something or other when suddenly some one rapped three times against the window pane the man went out to see what could be the matter and when he got out there stood a great big white bear good evening to you said the white bear good evening said the man will you give me your youngest daughter said the white bear if you will you shall be as rich as you are now poor truly the man would have had no objection to be rich but he thought to himself i must first ask my daughter about this so he went in and told them that there was a great white bear outside who had faithfully promised to make them all rich if he might but have the youngest daughter she said no and would not hear of it so the man went out again and settled with the white bear that he should come again next thursday evening and get her answer then the man persuaded her and talked so much to her about the wealth that they would have and what a good thing it would be for herself that at last she made up her mind to go and washed and mended all her rags made herself as smart as she could and held herself in readiness to set out little enough had she to take away with her next thursday evening the white bear came to fetch her she seated herself on his back with her bundle and thus they departed when they had gone a great part of the way the white bear said are you afraid no that i am not said she keep tight hold of my fur and then there is no danger said he and thus she rode far far away until they came to a great mountain then the white bear knocked on it and a door opened and they went into a castle where there were many brilliantly lighted rooms which shone with gold and silver likewise a large hall in which there was a well spread table and it was so magnificent that it would be hard to make anyone understand how splendid it was the white bear gave her a silver bell and told her that when she needed anything she had but to ring this bell and what she wanted would appear so after she had eaten and night was drawing near she grew sleepy after her journey and thought she would like to go to bed she rang the bell and scarcely had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed stood ready made for her which was as pretty as anyone could wish to sleep in it had pillows of silk and curtains of silk fringed with gold and everything that was in the room was of gold or silver but when she had lain down and put out the light a man came and lay down beside her and behold it was the white bear who cast off the form of a beast during the night she never saw him however for he always came after she had put out her light and went away before daylight appeared so all went well and happily for a time but then she began to be very sad and sorrowful for all day long she had to go about alone and she did so wish to go home to her father and mother and brothers and sisters then the white bear asked what it was that she wanted and she told him that it was so dull there in the mountain and that she had to go about all alone and that in her parents house at home there were all her brothers and sisters and it was because she could not go to them that she was so sorrowful there might be a cure for that said the white bear if you would but promise me never to talk with your mother alone but only when the others are there too for she will take hold of your hand he said and will want to lead you into a room to talk with you alone but that you must by no means do or you will bring great misery on both of us so one sunday the white bear came and said that they could now set out to see her father and mother and they journeyed thither she sitting on his back and they went a long long way and it took a long long time but at last they came to a large white farmhouse and her brothers and sisters were running about outside it playing and it was so pretty that it was a pleasure to look at it your parents dwell here now said the white bear but do not forget what i said to you or you will do much harm both to yourself and me no indeed said she i shall never forget and as soon as she was at home the white bear turned round and went back again there were such rejoicings when she went in to her parents that it seemed as if they would never come to an end everyone thought that he could never be sufficiently grateful to her for all she had done for them all now they had everything that they wanted and everything was as good as it could be they all asked her how she was getting on where she was all was well with her too she said and she had everything that she could want what other answers she gave i cannot say but i am pretty sure that they did not learn much from her but in the afternoon after they had dined at midday all happened just as the white bear had said her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber but she remembered what the white bear had said and would on no account go what we have to say can be said at any time she answered but somehow or other her mother at last persuaded her and she was forced to tell the whole story so she told how every night a man came and lay down beside her when the lights were all put out and how she never saw him because he always went away before it grew light in the morning and how she continually went about in sadness thinking how happy she would be if she could but see him and how all day long she had to go about alone and it was so dull and solitary oh cried the mother in horror you are very likely sleeping with a troll but i will teach you a way to see him you shall have a bit of one of my candles which you can take away with you hidden in your breast look at him with that when he is asleep but take care not to let any tallow drop upon him so she took the candle and hid it in her breast and when evening drew near the white bear came to fetch her away when they had gone some distance on their way the white bear asked her if everything had not happened just as he had foretold and she could not but own that it had then if you have done what your mother wished said he you have brought great misery on both of us no she said i have not done anything at all so when she had reached home and had gone to bed it was just the same as it had been before and a man came and lay down beside her and late at night when she could hear that he was sleeping she got up and kindled a light lit her candle let her light shine on him and saw him and he was the handsomest prince that eyes had ever beheld and she loved him so much that it seemed to her that she must die if she did not kiss him that very moment so she did kiss him but while she was doing it she let three drops of hot tallow fall upon his shirt and he awoke what have you done now said he you have brought misery on both of us if you had but held out for the space of one year i should have been free i have a step mother who has bewitched me so that i am a white bear by day and a man by night but now all is at an end between you and me and i must leave you and go to her she lives in a castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon and there too is a princess with a nose which is three ells long and she now is the one whom i must marry she wept and lamented but all in vain for go he must then she asked him if she could not go with him but no that could not be can you tell me the way then and i will seek you that i may surely be allowed to do yes you may do that said he but there is no way thither it lies east of the sun and west of the moon and never would you find your way there when she awoke in the morning both the prince and the castle were gone and she was lying on a small green patch in the midst of a dark thick wood by her side lay the self same bundle of rags which she had brought with her from her own home so when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes and wept till she was weary she set out on her way and thus she walked for many and many a long day until at last she came to a great mountain outside it an aged woman was sitting playing with a golden apple the girl asked her if she knew the way to the prince who lived with his stepmother in the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon and who was to marry a princess with a nose which was three ells long how do you happen to know about him inquired the old woman maybe you are she who ought to have had him yes indeed i am she said so it is you then said the old woman i know nothing about him but that he dwells in a castle which is east of the sun and west of the moon you will be a long time in getting to it if ever you get to it at all but you shall have the loan of my horse and then you can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine perhaps she can tell you about him when you have got there you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again but you may take the golden apple with you so the girl seated herself on the horse and rode for a long long way and at last she came to the mountain where an aged woman was sitting outside with a gold carding comb the girl asked her if she knew the way to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon but she said what the first old woman had said i know nothing about it but that it is east of the sun and west of the moon and that you will be a long time in getting to it if ever you get there at all but you shall have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me perhaps she may know where the castle is and when you have got to her you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again then she gave her the gold carding comb for it might perhaps be of use to her she said so the girl seated herself on the horse and rode a wearisome long way onward again and after a very long time she came to a great mountain where an aged woman was sitting spinning at a golden spinning wheel of this woman too she inquired if she knew the way to the prince and where to find the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon but it was only the same thing once again maybe it was you who should have had the prince said the old woman yes indeed i should have been the one said the girl but this old crone knew the way no better than the others it was east of the sun and west of the moon she knew that and you will be a long time in getting to it if ever you get to it at all she said but you may have the loan of my horse and i think you had better ride to the east wind and ask him perhaps he may know where the castle is and will blow you thither but when you have got to him you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear and he will come home again and then she gave her the golden spinning wheel saying perhaps you may find that you have a use for it the girl had to ride for a great many days and for a long and wearisome time before she got there but at last she did arrive and then she asked the east wind if he could tell her the way to the prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon well said the east wind i have heard tell of the prince and of his castle but i do not know the way to it for i have never blown so far but if you like i will go with you to my brother the west wind he may know that for he is much stronger than i am you may sit on my back and then i can carry you there so she seated herself on his back and they did go so swiftly when they got there the east wind went in and said that the girl whom he had brought was the one who ought to have had the prince up at the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon and that now she was traveling about to find him again so he had come there with her and would like to hear if the west wind knew whereabout the castle was no said the west wind so far as that have i never blown but if you like i will go with you to the south wind for he is much stronger than either of us and he has roamed far and wide and perhaps he can tell you what you want to know you may seat yourself on my back and then i will carry you to him so she did this and journeyed to the south wind neither was she very long on the way when they had got there the west wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon for she was the girl who ought to marry the prince who lived there oh indeed said the south wind is that she well said he i have wandered about a great deal in my time and in all kinds of places but i have never blown so far as that if you like however i will go with you to my brother the north wind he is the oldest and strongest of all of us and if he does not know where it is no one in the whole world will be able to tell you you may sit upon my back and then i will carry you there so she seated herself on his back and off he went from his house in great haste and they were not long on the way when they came near the north wind's dwelling he was so wild and frantic that they felt cold gusts a long while before they got there what do you want he roared out from afar and they froze as they heard said the south wind it is i and this is she who should have had the prince who lives in the castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon and now she wishes to ask you if you have ever been there and can tell her the way for she would gladly find him again yes said the north wind i know where it is i once blew an aspen leaf there but i was so tired that for many days afterward i was not able to blow at all however if you really are anxious to go there and are not afraid to go with me i will take you on my back and try if i can blow you there get there i must said she and if there is any way of going i will and i have no fear no matter how fast you go very well then said the north wind but you must sleep here to night for if we are ever to get there we must have the day before us the north wind woke her betimes next morning and puffed himself up and made himself so big and so strong that it was frightful to see him and away they went high up through the air as if they would not stop until they had reached the very end of the world down below there was such a storm it blew down woods and houses and when they were above the sea the ships were wrecked by hundreds and thus they tore on and on and a long time went by and then yet more time passed and still they were above the sea and the north wind grew tired and more tired and at last so utterly weary that he was scarcely able to blow any longer and he sank and sank lower and lower until at last he went so low that the waves dashed against the heels of the poor girl he was carrying art thou afraid said the north wind i have no fear said she and it was true but they were not very very far from land and there was just enough strength left in the north wind to enable him to throw her on to the shore immediately under the windows of a castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon but then he was so weary and worn out that he was forced to rest for several days before he could go to his own home again next morning she sat down beneath the walls of the castle to play with the golden apple and the first person she saw was the maiden with the long nose who was to have the prince how much do you want for that gold apple of yours girl said she opening the window it can't be bought either for gold or money answered the girl if it cannot be bought either for gold or money what will buy it you may say what you please said the princess well if i may go to the prince who is here and be with him to night you shall have it said the girl who had come with the north wind you may do that said the princess for she had made up her mind what she would do so the princess got the golden apple but when the girl went up to the prince's apartment that night he"
