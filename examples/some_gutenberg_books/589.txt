"1" "when ye _call_ on him repeated mr stewart am i daft or are you what takes ye near the advocate o just to give myself up said i mr balfour he cried are ye making a mock of me no sir said i though i think you have allowed yourself some such freedom with myself but i give you to understand once and for all that i am in no jesting spirit nor yet me says stewart and i give yon to understand if that’s to be the word that i like the looks of your behaviour less and less you come here to me with all sorts of propositions which will put me in a train of very doubtful acts and bring me among very undesirable persons this many a day to come and then you tell me you’re going straight out of my office to make your peace with the advocate alan’s button here or alan’s button there the four quarters of alan wouldnae bribe me further in i would take it with a little more temper said i and perhaps we can avoid what you object to i can see no way for it but to give myself up but perhaps you can see another and if you could i could never deny but what i would be rather relieved for i think my traffic with his lordship is little likely to agree with my health there’s just the one thing clear that i have to give my evidence for i hope it’ll save alan’s character what’s left of it and james’s neck which is the more immediate he was silent for a breathing space and then my man said he you’ll never be allowed to give such evidence we’ll have to see about that said i i’m stiff necked when i like ye muckle ass cried stewart it’s james they want james has got to hang alan too if they could catch him but james whatever go near the advocate with any such business and you’ll see he’ll find a way to muzzle ye i think better of the advocate than that said i the advocate be dammed cries he it’s the campbells man you’ll have the whole clanjamfry of them on your back and so will the advocate too poor body it’s extraordinar ye cannot see where ye stand if there’s no fair way to stop your gab there’s a foul one gaping they can put ye in the dock do ye no see that he cried and stabbed me with one finger in the leg ay said i i was told that same no further back than this morning by another lawyer and who was he asked stewart he spoke sense at least i told i must be excused from naming him for he was a decent stout old whig and had little mind to be mixed up in such affairs i think all the world seems to be mixed up in it cries stewart but what said you i told him what had passed between rankeillor and myself before the house of shaws well and so ye will hang said he ye’ll hang beside james stewart there’s your fortune told i hope better of it yet than that said i but i could never deny there was a risk risk says he and then sat silent again i ought to thank you for your staunchness to my friends to whom you show a very good spirit he says if you have the strength to stand by it but i warn you that you’re wading deep i wouldn’t put myself in your place me that’s a stewart born for all the stewarts that ever there were since noah risk ay i take over many but to be tried in court before a campbell jury and a campbell judge and that in a campbell country and upon a campbell quarrel think what you like of me balfour it’s beyond me it’s a different way of thinking i suppose said i i was brought up to this one by my father before me glory to his bones he has left a decent son to his name says he yet i would not have you judge me over sorely my case is dooms hard see sir ye tell me ye’re a whig i wonder what i am no whig to be sure i couldnae be just that but laigh in your ear man i’m maybe no very keen on the other side is that a fact cried i it’s what i would think of a man of your intelligence hut none of your whillywhas 4 cries he there’s intelligence upon both sides but for my private part i have no particular desire to harm king george and as for king james god bless him he does very well for me across the water i’m a lawyer ye see fond of my books and my bottle a good plea a well drawn deed a crack in the parliament house with other lawyer bodies and perhaps a turn at the golf on a saturday at e’en where do ye come in with your hieland plaids and claymores well said i it’s a fact ye have little of the wild highlandman little quoth he nothing man and yet i’m hieland born and when the clan pipes who but me has to dance the clan and the name that goes by all it’s just what you said yourself my father learned it to me and a bonny trade i have of it treason and traitors and the smuggling of them out and in and the french recruiting weary fall it and the smuggling through of the recruits and their pleas a sorrow of their pleas here have i been moving one for young ardsheil my cousin claimed the estate under the marriage contract a forfeited estate i told them it was nonsense muckle they cared and there was i cocking behind a yadvocate that liked the business as little as myself for it was fair ruin to the pair of us a black mark _disaffected_ branded on our hurdies like folk’s names upon their kye and what can i do i’m a stewart ye see and must fend for my clan and family then no later by than yesterday there was one of our stewart lads carried to the castle what for i ken fine act of 1736 recruiting for king lewie and you’ll see he’ll whistle me in to be his lawyer and there’ll be another black mark on my chara’ter i tell you fair if i but kent the heid of a hebrew word from the hurdies of it be dammed but i would fling the whole thing up and turn minister it’s rather a hard position said i dooms hard cries he and that’s what makes me think so much of ye you that’s no stewart to stick your head so deep in stewart business and for what i do not know unless it was the sense of duty i hope it will be that said i well says he it’s a grand quality but here is my clerk back and by your leave we’ll pick a bit of dinner all the three of us when that’s done i’ll give you the direction of a very decent man that’ll be very fain to have you for a lodger and i’ll fill your pockets to ye forbye out of your ain bag for this business’ll not be near as dear as ye suppose not even the ship part of it i made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing hoot ye neednae mind for robbie cries he a stewart too puir deevil and has smuggled out more french recruits and trafficking papists than what he has hairs upon his face why it’s robin that manages that branch of my affairs who will we have now rob for across the water there’ll be andie scougal in the _thristle_ replied rob i saw hoseason the other day but it seems he’s wanting the ship then there’ll be tam stobo but i’m none so sure of tam i’ve seen him colloguing with some gey queer acquaintances and if was anybody important i would give tam the go by the head’s worth two hundred pounds robin said stewart gosh that’ll no be alan breck cried the clerk just alan said his master weary winds that’s sayrious cried robin i’ll try andie then andie’ll be the best it seems it’s quite a big business i observed mr balfour there’s no end to it said stewart there was a name your clerk mentioned i went on hoseason that must be my man i think hoseason of the brig _covenant_ would you set your trust on him he didnae behave very well to you and alan said mr stewart but my mind of the man in general is rather otherwise if he had taken alan on board his ship on an agreement it’s my notion he would have proved a just dealer how say ye rob no more honest skipper in the trade than eli said the clerk i would lippen to 5 eli’s word ay if it was the chevalier or appin himsel he added and it was him that brought the doctor wasnae’t asked the master he was the very man said the clerk and i think he took the doctor back says stewart ay with his sporran full cried robin and eli kent of that 6 well it seems it’s hard to ken folk rightly said i that was just what i forgot when ye came in mr balfour says the writer chapter iii i go to pilrig the next morning i was no sooner awake in my new lodging than i was up and into my new clothes and no sooner the breakfast swallowed than i was forth on my adventurers alan i could hope was fended for james was like to be a more difficult affair and i could not but think that enterprise might cost me dear even as everybody said to whom i had opened my opinion it seemed i was come to the top of the mountain only to cast myself down that i had clambered up through so many and hard trials to be rich to be recognised to wear city clothes and a sword to my side all to commit mere suicide at the last end of it and the worst kind of suicide besides which is to get hanged at the king’s charges what was i doing it for i asked as i went down the high street and out north by leith wynd first i said it was to save james stewart and no doubt the memory of his distress and his wife’s cries and a word or so i had let drop on that occasion worked upon me strongly at the same time i reflected that it was or ought to be the most indifferent matter to my father’s son whether james died in his bed or from a scaffold he was alan’s cousin to be sure but so far as regarded alan the best thing would be to lie low and let the king and his grace of argyll and the corbie crows pick the bones of his kinsman their own way nor could i forget that while we were all in the pot together james had shown no such particular anxiety whether for alan or me next it came upon me i was acting for the sake of justice and i thought that a fine word and reasoned it out that since we dwelt in polities at some discomfort to each one of us the main thing of all must still be justice and the death of any innocent man a wound upon the whole community next again it was the accuser of the brethren that gave me a turn of his argument bade me think shame for pretending myself concerned in these high matters and told me i was but a prating vain child who had spoken big words to rankeillor and to stewart and held myself bound upon my vanity to make good that boastfulness nay and he hit me with the other end of the stick for he accused me of a kind of artful cowardice going about at the expense of a little risk to purchase greater safety no doubt until i had declared and cleared myself i might any day encounter mungo campbell or the sheriff’s officer and be recognised and dragged into the appin murder by the heels and no doubt in case i could manage my declaration with success i should breathe more free for ever after but when i looked this argument full in the face i could see nothing to be ashamed of as for the rest here are the two roads i thought and both go to the same place it’s unjust that james should hang if i can save him and it would be ridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do nothing it’s lucky for james of the glens that i have boasted beforehand and none so unlucky for myself because now i’m committed to do right i have the name of a gentleman and the means of one it would be a poor duty that i was wanting in the essence and then i thought this was a pagan spirit and said a prayer in to myself asking for what courage i might lack and that i might go straight to my duty like a soldier to battle and come off again scatheless as so many do this train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion though it was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that surrounded me nor of how very apt i was if i went on to stumble on the ladder of the gallows it was a plain fair morning but the wind in the east the little chill of it sang in my blood and gave me a feeling of the autumn and the dead leaves and dead folks bodies in their graves it seemed the devil was in it if i was to die in that tide of my fortunes and for other folks affairs on the top of the calton hill though it was not the customary time of year for that diversion some children were crying and running with their kites these toys appeared very plain against the sky i remarked a great one soar on the wind to a high altitude and then plump among the whins and i thought to myself at sight of it there goes davie my way lay over mouter’s hill and through an end of a clachan on the braeside among fields there was a whirr of looms in it went from house to house bees bummed in the gardens the neighbours that i saw at the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue and i found out later that this was picardy a village where the french weavers wrought for the linen company here i got a fresh direction for pilrig my destination and a little beyond on the wayside came by a gibbet and two men hanged in chains they were dipped in tar as the manner is the wind span them the chains clattered and the birds hung about the uncanny jumping jacks and cried the sight coming on me suddenly like an illustration of my fears i could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in discomfort and as i thus turned and turned about the gibbet what should i strike on but a weird old wife that sat behind a leg of it and nodded and talked aloud to herself with becks and courtesies who are these two mother i asked and pointed to the corpses a blessing on your precious face she cried twa joes 7 o’mine just two o my old joes my hinny dear what did they suffer for i asked ou just for the guid cause said she aften i spaed to them the way that it would end twa shillin scots no pickle mair and there are twa bonny callants hingin for t they took it frae a wean 8 belanged to brouchton ay said i to myself and not to the daft limmer and did they come to such a figure for so poor a business this is to lose all indeed gie’s your loof 9 hinny says she and let me spae your weird to ye no mother said i i see far enough the way i am it’s an unco thing to see too far in front i read it in your bree she said there’s a bonnie lassie that has bricht een and there’s a wee man in a braw coat and a big man in a pouthered wig and there’s the shadow of the wuddy 10 joe that lies braid across your path gie’s your loof hinny and let auld merren spae it to ye bonny the two chance shots that seemed to point at alan and the daughter of james more struck me hard and i fled from the eldritch creature casting her a baubee which she continued to sit and play with under the moving shadows of the hanged my way down the causeway of leith walk would have been more pleasant to me but for this encounter the old rampart ran among fields the like of them i had never seen for artfulness of agriculture i was pleased besides to be so far in the still countryside but the shackles of the gibbet clattered in my head and the mope and mows of the old witch and the thought of the dead men hag rode my spirits to hang on a gallows that seemed a hard case and whether a man came to hang there for two shillings scots or as mr stewart had it from the sense of duty once he was tarred and shackled and hung up the difference seemed small there might david balfour hang and other lads pass on their errands and think light of him and old daft limmers sit at a leg foot and spae their fortunes and the clean genty maids go by and look to the other aide and hold a nose i saw them plain and they had grey eyes and their screens upon their heads were of the drummed colours i was thus in the poorest of spirits though still pretty resolved when i came in view of pilrig a pleasant gabled house set by the walkside among some brave young woods the laird’s horse was standing saddled at the door as i came up but himself was in the study where he received me in the midst of learned works and musical instruments for he was not only a deep philosopher but much of a musician he greeted me at first pretty well and when he had read rankeillor’s letter placed himself obligingly at my disposal and what is it cousin david said he since it appears that we are cousins what is this that i can do for you a word to prestongrange doubtless that is easily given but what should be the word mr balfour said i if i were to tell you my whole story the way it fell out it’s my opinion and it was rankeillor’s before me that you would be very little made up with it i am sorry to hear this of you kinsman says he i must not take that at your hands mr balfour said i i have nothing to my charge to make me sorry or you for me but just the common infirmities of mankind the guilt of adam’s first sin the want of original righteousness and the corruption of my whole nature so much i must answer for and i hope i have been taught where to look for help i said for i judged from the look of the man he would think the better of me if i knew my questions 11 but in the way of worldly honour i have no great stumble to reproach myself with and my difficulties have befallen me very much against my will and by all that i can see without my fault my trouble is to have become dipped in a political complication which it is judged you would be blythe to avoid a knowledge of why very well mr david he replied i am pleased to see you are all that rankeillor represented and for what you say of political complications you do me no more than justice it is my study to be beyond suspicion and indeed outside the field of it the question is says he how if i am to know nothing of the matter i can very well assist you why sir said i i propose you should write to his lordship that i am a young man of reasonable good family and of good means both of which i believe to be the case i have rankeillor’s word for it said mr balfour and i count that a warran dice against all deadly to which you might add if you will take my word for so much that i am a good churchman loyal to king george and so brought up i went on none of which will do you any harm said mr balfour then you might go on to say that i sought his lordship on a matter of great moment connected with his majesty’s service and the administration of justice i suggested as i am not to hear the matter says the laird i will not take upon myself to qualify its weight great moment therefore falls and moment along with it for the rest i might express myself much as you propose and then sir said i and rubbed my neck a little with my thumb then i would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps tell for my protection protection says he for your protection here is a phrase that somewhat dampens me if the matter be so dangerous i own i would be a little loath to move in it blindfold i believe i could indicate in two words where the thing sticks said i perhaps that would be the best said he well it’s the appin murder said i he held up both his hands sirs sirs cried he i thought by the expression of his face and voice that i had lost my helper let me explain i began i thank you kindly i will hear no more of it says he i decline _in toto_ to hear more of it for your name’s sake and rankeillor’s and perhaps a little for your own i will do what i can to help you but i will hear no more upon the facts and it is my first clear duty to warn you these are deep waters mr david and you are a young man be cautious and think twice it is to be supposed i will have thought oftener than that mr balfour said i and i will direct your attention again to rankeillor’s letter where i hope and believe he has registered his approval of that which i design well well said he and then again well well i will do what i can for you there with he took a pen and paper sat a while in thought and began to write with much consideration i understand that rankeillor approved of what you have in mind he asked presently after some discussion sir he bade me to go forward in god’s name said i that is the name to go in said mr balfour and resumed his writing presently he signed re read what he had written and addressed me again now here mr david said he is a letter of introduction which i will seal without closing and give into your hands open as the form requires but since i am acting in the dark i will just read it to you so that you may see if it will secure your end pilrig _august_ 26th 1751 my lord this is to bring to your notice my namesake and cousin david balfour esquire of shaws a young gentleman of unblemished descent and good estate he has enjoyed besides the more valuable advantages of a godly training and his political principles are all that your lordship can desire i am not in mr balfour’s confidence but i understand him to have a matter to declare touching his majesty’s service and the administration of justice purposes for which your lordship’s zeal is known i should add that the young gentleman’s intention is known to and approved by some of his friends who will watch with hopeful anxiety the event of his success or failure whereupon continued mr balfour i have subscribed myself with the usual compliments you observe i have said some of your friends i hope you can justify my plural perfectly sir my purpose is known and approved by more than one said i and your letter which i take a pleasure to thank you for is all i could have hoped it was all i could squeeze out said he and from what i know of the matter you design to meddle in i can only pray god that it may prove sufficient chapter iv lord advocate prestongrange my kinsman kept me to a meal for the honour of the roof he said and i believe i made the better speed on my return i had no thought but to be done with the next stage and have myself fully committed to a person circumstanced as i was the appearance of closing a door on hesitation and temptation was itself extremely tempting and i was the more disappointed when i came to prestongrange’s house to be informed he was abroad i believe it was true at the moment and for some hours after and then i have no doubt the advocate came home again and enjoyed himself in a neighbouring chamber among friends while perhaps the very fact of my arrival was forgotten i would have gone away a dozen times only for this strong drawing to have done with my declaration out of hand and be able to lay me down to sleep with a free conscience at first i read for the little cabinet where i was left contained a variety of books but i fear i read with little profit and the weather falling cloudy the dusk coming up earlier than usual and my cabinet being lighted with but a loophole of a window i was at last obliged to desist from this diversion such as it was and pass the rest of my time of waiting in a very burthensome vacuity the sound of people talking in a near chamber the pleasant note of a harpsichord and once the voice of a lady singing bore me a kind of company i do not know the hour but the darkness was long come when the door of the cabinet opened and i was aware by the light behind him of a tall figure of a man upon the threshold i rose at once is anybody there he asked who in that i am bearer of a letter from the laird of pilrig to the lord advocate said i have you been here long he asked i would not like to hazard an estimate of how many hours said i it is the first i hear of it he replied with a chuckle the lads must have forgotten you but you are in the bit at last for i am prestongrange so saying he passed before me into the next room whither upon his sign i followed him and where he lit a candle and took his place before a business table it was a long room of a good proportion wholly lined with books that small spark of light in a corner struck out the man’s handsome person and strong face he was flushed his eye watered and sparkled and before he sat down i observed him to sway back and forth no doubt he had been supping liberally but his mind and tongue were under full control well sir sit ye down said he and let us see pilrig’s letter he glanced it through in the beginning carelessly looking up and bowing when he came to my name but at the last words i thought i observed his attention to redouble and i made sure he read them twice all this while you are to suppose my heart was beating for i had now crossed my rubicon and was come fairly on the field of battle i am pleased to make your acquaintance mr balfour he said when he had done let me offer you a glass of claret under your favour my lord i think it would scarce be fair on me said i i have come here as the letter will have mentioned on a business of some gravity to myself and as i am little used with wine i might be the sooner affected you shall be the judge said he but if you will permit i believe i will even have the bottle in myself he touched a bell and a footman came as at a signal bringing wine and glasses you are sure you will not join me asked the advocate well here is to our better acquaintance in what way can i serve you i should perhaps begin by telling you my lord that i am here at your own pressing invitation"
