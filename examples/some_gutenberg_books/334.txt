here mr van bibber simply to tell me this what have you to do with it what have i to do with it why did you come because of the child what child your child said van bibber young van bibber was quite prepared for an outbreak of some sort and mentally braced himself to receive it he rapidly assured himself that this man had every reason to be angry and that he if he meant to accomplish anything had every reason to be considerate and patient so he faced mr caruthers with shoulders squared as though it were a physical shock he had to stand against and in consequence he was quite unprepared for what followed for mr caruthers raised his face without a trace of feeling in it and with his eyes still fixed on the glass in his hand set it carefully down on the mantel beside him and girded himself about with the rope of his robe when he spoke it was in a tone of quiet politeness mr van bibber he began you are a very brave young man you have dared to say to me what those who are my best friends what even my own family would not care to say they are afraid it might hurt me i suppose they have some absurd regard for my feelings they hesitate to touch upon a subject which in no way concerns them and which they know must be very painful to me but you have the courage of your convictions you have no compunctions about tearing open old wounds and you come here unasked and uninvited to let me know what you think of my conduct to let me understand that it does not agree with your own ideas of what i ought to do and to tell me how i who am old enough to be your father should behave you have rushed in where angels fear to tread mr van bibber to show me the error of my ways i suppose i ought to thank you for it but i have always said that it is not the wicked people who are to be feared in this world or who do the most harm we know them we can prepare for them and checkmate them it is the well meaning fool who makes all the trouble for no one knows him until he discloses himself and the mischief is done before he can be stopped i think if you will allow me to say so that you have demonstrated my theory pretty thoroughly and have done about as much needless harm for one evening as you can possibly wish and so if you will excuse me he continued sternly and moving from his place i will ask to say good night and will request of you that you grow older and wiser and much more considerate before you come to see me again van bibber had flushed at mr caruthers's first words and had then grown somewhat pale and straightened himself visibly he did not move when the elder man had finished but cleared his throat and then spoke with some little difficulty it is very easy to call a man a fool he said slowly but it is much harder to be called a fool and not to throw the other man out of the window but that you see would not do any good and i have something to say to you first i am quite clear in my own mind as to my position and i am not going to allow anything you have said or can say to annoy me much until i am through there will be time enough to resent it then i am quite well aware that i did an unconventional thing in coming here a bold thing or a foolish thing as you choose but the situation is pretty bad and i did as i would have wished to be done by if i had had a child going to the devil and didn't know it i should have been glad to learn of it even from a stranger however he said smiling grimly and pulling his cape about him there are other kindly disposed people in the world besides fathers there is an aunt perhaps or an uncle or two and sometimes even to day there is the chance samaritan van bibber picked up his high hat from the table looked into it critically and settled it on his head good night he said and walked slowly towards the door he had his hand on the knob when mr caruthers raised his head wait just one minute please mr van bibber asked mr caruthers van bibber stopped with a prompt obedience which would have led one to conclude that he might have put on his hat only to precipitate matters before you go said mr caruthers grudgingly i want to say i want you to understand my position oh that's all right said van bibber lightly opening the door no it is not all right one moment please i do not intend that you shall go away from here with the idea that you have tried to do me a service and that i have been unable to appreciate it and that you are a much abused and much misunderstood young man since you have done me the honor to make my affairs your business i would prefer that you should understand them fully i do not care to have you discuss my conduct at clubs and afternoon teas with young women until you van bibber drew in his breath sharply with a peculiar whistling sound and opened and shut his hands oh i wouldn't say that if i were you he said simply i beg your pardon the older man said quickly that was a mistake i was wrong i beg your pardon but you have tried me very sorely you have intruded upon a private trouble that you ought to know must be very painful to me but i believe you meant well i know you to be a gentleman and i am willing to think you acted on impulse and that you will see to morrow what a mistake you have made it is not a thing i talk about i do not speak of it to my friends and they are far too considerate to speak of it to me but you have put me on the defensive you have made me out more or less of a brute and i don't intend to be so far misunderstood there are two sides to every story and there is something to be said about this even for me he walked back to his place beside the mantel and put his shoulders against it and faced van bibber with his fingers twisted in the cord around his waist when i married said mr caruthers i did so against the wishes of my people and the advice of all my friends you know all about that god help us who doesn't he added bitterly it was very rich rare reading for you and for every one else who saw the daily papers and we gave them all they wanted of it i took her out of that life and married her because i believed she was as good a woman as any of those who had never had to work for their living and i was bound that my friends and your friends should recognize her and respect her as my wife had a right to be respected and i took her abroad that i might give all you sensitive fine people a chance to get used to the idea of being polite to a woman who had once been a burlesque actress it began over there in paris what i went through then no one knows but when i came back and i would never have come back if she had not made me it was my friends i had to consider and not her it was in the blood it was in the life she had led and in the life men like you and me had taught her to live and it had to come out the muscles of mr caruthers's face were moving and beyond his control but van bibber did not see this for he was looking intently out of the window over the roofs of the city she had every chance when she married me that a woman ever had continued the older man it only depended on herself i didn't try to make a housewife of her or a drudge she had all the healthy excitement and all the money she wanted and she had a home here ready for her whenever she was tired of travelling about and wished to settle down and i was and a husband that loved her as she had everything everything that a man's whole thought and love and money could bring to her and you know what she did he looked at van bibber but van bibber's eyes were still turned towards the open window and the night and after the divorce and she was free to go where she pleased and to live as she pleased and with whom she pleased without bringing disgrace on a husband who honestly loved her i swore to my god that i would never see her nor her child again and i never saw her again not even when she died i loved the mother and she deceived me and disgraced me and broke my heart and i only wish she had killed me and i was beginning to love her child and i vowed she should not live to trick me too i had suffered as no man i know had suffered in a way a boy like you cannot understand and that no one can understand who has not gone to hell and been forced to live after it and was i to go through that again was i to love and care for and worship this child and have her grow up with all her mother's vanity and animal nature and have her turn on me some day and show me that what is bred in the bone must tell and that i was a fool again a pitiful fond fool i could not trust her i can never trust any woman or child again and least of all that woman's child she is as dead to me as though she were buried with her mother and it is nothing to me what she is or what her life is i know in time what it will be she has begun earlier than i had supposed that is all but she is nothing to me the man stopped and turned his back to van bibber and hid his head in his hands with his elbows on the mantelpiece i care too much he said i cannot let it mean anything to me when i do care it means so much more to me than to other men they may pretend to laugh and to forget and to outgrow it but it is not so with me it means too much he took a quick stride towards one of the arm chairs and threw himself into it why man he cried i loved that child's mother to the day of her death i loved that woman then and god help me i love that woman still he covered his face with his hands and sat leaning forward and breathing heavily as he rocked himself to and fro van bibber still stood looking gravely out at the lights that picketed the black surface of the city he was to all appearances as unmoved by the outburst of feeling into which the older man had been surprised as though it had been something in a play there was an unbroken silence for a moment and then it was van bibber who was the first to speak i came here as you say on impulse he said but i am glad i came for i have your decisive answer now about the little girl i have been thinking he continued slowly since you have been speaking and before when i first saw her dancing in front of the footlights when i did not know who she was that i could give up a horse or two if necessary and support this child instead children are worth more than horses and a man who saves a soul as it says he flushed slightly and looked up with a hesitating deprecatory smile somewhere wipes out a multitude of sins and it may be i'd like to try and get rid of some of mine i know just where to send her i know the very place it's down in evergreen bay on long island they are tenants of mine there and very nice farm sort of people who will be very good to her they wouldn't know anything about her and she'd forget what little she knows of this present life very soon and grow up with the other children to be one of them and then when she gets older and becomes a young lady she could go to some school but that's a bit too far ahead to plan for the present but that's what i am going to do though said the young man confidently and as though speaking to himself that theatrical boarding house person could be bought off easily enough he went on quickly and lester won't mind letting her go if i ask it and and that's what i'll do as you say it's a good deal of an experiment but i think i'll run the risk he walked quickly to the door and disappeared in the hall and then came back kicking the door open as he returned and holding the child in his arms this is she he said quietly he did not look at or notice the father but stood with the child asleep in the bend of his left arm gazing down at her this is she he repeated this is your child there was something cold and satisfied in van bibber's tone and manner as though he were congratulating himself upon the engaging of a new groom something that placed the father entirely outside of it he might have been a disinterested looker on she will need to be fed a bit van bibber ran on cheerfully they did not treat her very well i fancy she is thin and peaked and tired looking he drew up the loose sleeve of her jacket and showed the bare forearm to the light he put his thumb and little finger about it and closed them on it gently it is very thin he said and under her eyes if it were not for the paint he went on mercilessly you could see how deep the lines are this red spot on her cheek he said gravely is where mary vane kissed her to night and this is where alma stantley kissed her and that lee girl you have heard of them perhaps they will never kiss her again she is going to grow up a sweet fine beautiful woman are you not he said gently drawing the child higher up on his shoulder until her face touched his and still keeping his eyes from the face of the older man she does not look like her mother he said she has her father's auburn hair and straight nose and finer cut lips and chin she looks very much like her father it seems a pity he added abruptly she will grow up he went on without knowing him or who he is or was if he should die she will never speak with him or see him or take his hand she may pass him some day on the street and will not know him and he will not know her but she will grow to be very fond and to be very grateful to the simple kindhearted old people who will have cared for her when she was a little girl the child in his arms stirred shivered slightly and awoke the two men watched her breathlessly with silent intentness she raised her head and stared around the unfamiliar room doubtfully then turned to where her father stood looking at him a moment and passed him by and then looking up into van bibber's face recognized him and gave a gentle sleepy smile and with a sigh of content and confidence drew her arm up closer around his neck and let her head fall back upon his breast the father sprang to his feet with a quick jealous gasp of pain give her to me he said fiercely under his breath snatching her out of van bibber's arms she is mine give her to me van bibber closed the door gently behind him and went jumping down the winding stairs of the berkeley three steps at a time and an hour later when the english servant came to his master's door he found him still awake and sitting in the dark by the open window holding something in his arms and looking out over the sleeping city james he said you can make up a place for me here on the lounge miss caruthers my daughter will sleep in my room to night van bibber's man servant van bibber's man walters was the envy and admiration of his friends he was english of course and he had been trained in the household of the marquis bendinot and had travelled in his younger days as the valet of young lord upton he was now rather well on in years although it would have been impossible to say just how old he was walters had a dignified and repellent air about him and he brushed his hair in such a way as to conceal his baldness and when a smirking slavish youth with red checks and awkward gestures turned up in van bibber's livery his friends were naturally surprised and asked how he had come to lose walters van bibber could not say exactly at least he could not rightly tell whether he had dismissed walters or walters had dismissed himself the facts of the unfortunate separation were like this van bibber gave a great many dinners during the course of the season at delmonico's dinners hardly formal enough to require a private room and yet too important to allow of his running the risk of keeping his guests standing in the hall waiting for a vacant table so he conceived the idea of sending walters over about half past six to keep a table for him as everybody knows you can hold a table yourself at delmonico's for any length of time until the other guests arrive but the rule is very strict about servants because as the head waiter will tell you if servants were allowed to reserve a table during the big rush at seven o'clock why not messenger boys and it would certainly never do to have half a dozen large tables securely held by minute messengers while the hungry and impatient waited their turn at the door but walters looked as much like a gentleman as did many of the diners and when he seated himself at the largest table and told the waiter to serve for a party of eight or ten he did it with such an air that the head waiter came over himself and took the orders walters knew quite as much about ordering a dinner as did his master and when van bibber was too tired to make out the menu walters would look over the card himself and order the proper wines and side dishes and with such a carelessly severe air and in such a masterly manner did he discharge this high function that the waiters looked upon him with much respect but respect even from your equals and the satisfaction of having your fellow servants mistake you for a member of the few hundred are not enough walters wanted more he wanted the further satisfaction of enjoying the delicious dishes he had ordered of sitting as a coequal with the people for whom he had kept a place of completing the deception he practised only up to the point where it became most interesting it certainly was trying to have to rise with a subservient and unobtrusive bow and glide out unnoticed by the real guests when they arrived to have to relinquish the feast just when the feast should begin it would not be pleasant certainly to sit for an hour at a big empty table ordering dishes fit only for epicures and then just as the waiters bore down with the little neck clams so nicely iced and so cool and bitter looking to have to rise and go out into the street to a table d'hote around the corner this was walters's state of mind when mr van bibber told him for the hundredth time to keep a table for him for three at delmonico's walters wrapped his severe figure in a frock coat and brushed his hair and allowed himself the dignity of a walking stick he would have liked to act as a substitute in an evening dress suit but van bibber would not have allowed it so walters walked over to delmonico's and took a table near a window and said that the other gentlemen would arrive later then he looked at his watch and ordered the dinner it was just the sort of dinner he would have ordered had he ordered it for himself at some one else's expense he suggested little neck clams first with chablis and pea soup and caviare on toast before the oyster crabs with johannisberger cabinet then an entree of calves brains and rice then no roast but a bird cold asparagus with french dressing camembert cheese and turkish coffee as there were to be no women he omitted the sweets and added three other wines to follow the white wine it struck him as a particularly well chosen dinner and the longer he sat and thought about it the more he wished he were to test its excellence and then the people all around him were so bright and happy and seemed to be enjoying what they had ordered with such a refinement of zest that he felt he would give a great deal could he just sit there as one of them for a brief hour at that moment the servant deferentially handed him a note which a messenger boy had brought it said dinner off called out town send clothes and things after me to young's boston van bibber walters rose involuntarily and then sat still to think about it he would have to countermand the dinner which he had ordered over half an hour before and he would have to explain who he was to those other servants who had always regarded him as such a great gentleman it was very hard and then walters was tempted he was a very good servant and he knew his place as only an english servant can and he had always accepted it but to night he was tempted and he fell he met the waiter's anxious look with a grave smile the other gentlemen will not be with me to night he said glancing at the note but i will dine here as i intended you can serve for one that was perhaps the proudest night in the history of walters he had always felt that he was born out of his proper sphere and to night he was assured of it he was a little nervous at first lest some of van bibber's friends should come in and recognize him but as the dinner progressed and the warm odor of the dishes touched his sense and the rich wines ran through his veins and the women around him smiled and bent and moved like beautiful birds of beautiful plumage he became content grandly content and he half closed his eyes and imagined he was giving a dinner to everybody in the place vain and idle thoughts came to him and went again and he eyed the others about him calmly and with polite courtesy as they did him and he felt that if he must later pay for this moment it was worth the paying then he gave the waiter a couple of dollars out of his own pocket and wrote van bibber's name on the check and walked in state into the cafe where he ordered a green mint and a heavy black and expensive cigar and seated himself at the window where he felt that he should always have sat if the fates had been just the smoke hung in light clouds about him and the lights shone and glistened on the white cloths and the broad shirt fronts of the smart young men and distinguished foreign looking older men at the surrounding tables and then in the midst of his dreamings he heard the soft careless drawl of his master which sounded at that time and in that place like the awful voice of a condemning judge van bibber pulled out a chair and dropped into it his side was towards walters so that he did not see him he had some men with him and he was explaining how he had missed his train and had come back to find that one of the party had eaten the dinner without him and he wondered who it could be and then turning easily in his seat he saw walters with the green mint and the cigar trembling behind a copy of the london graphic walters said van bibber what are you doing here walters looked his guilt and rose stiffly he began with a feeble if you please sir go back to my rooms and wait for me there said van bibber who was too decent a fellow to scold a servant in public walters rose and left the half finished cigar and the mint with the ice melting in it on the table his one evening of sublimity was over and he walked away bending before the glance of his young master and the smiles of his master's friends when van bibber came back he found on his dressing table a note from walters stating that he could not of course expect to remain longer in his service and that he left behind him the twenty eight dollars which the dinner had cost if he had only gone off with all my waistcoats and scarf pins i'd have liked it better said van bibber than his leaving me cash for infernal dinner why a servant like walters is worth twenty eight dollar dinners twice a day the hungry man was fed young van bibber broke one of his rules of life one day and came down town this unusual journey into the marts of trade and finance was in response to a call from his lawyer who wanted his signature to some papers it was five years since van bibber had been south of the north side of washington square except as a transient traveller to the ferries on the elevated road and as he walked through the city hall square he looked about him at the new buildings in the air and the bustle and confusion of the streets with as much interest as a lately arrived immigrant he rather enjoyed the novelty of the situation and after he had completed his business at the lawyer's office he tried to stroll along lower broadway as he did on the avenue but people bumped against him and carts and drays tried to run him down when he crossed the side streets and those young men whom he knew seemed to be in a great hurry and expressed such amused surprise at seeing him that he felt very much out of place indeed and so he decided to get back to his club window and its quiet as soon as possible hello van bibber said one of the young men who were speeding by what brings you here have you lost your way i think i have said van bibber if you'll kindly tell me how i can get back to civilization again be obliged to you take the elevated from park place said his friend from over his shoulder as he nodded and dived into the crowd the visitor from up town had not a very distinct idea as to where park place was but he struck off broadway and followed the line of the elevated road along church street it was at the corner of vesey street that a miserable looking dirty and red eyed object stood still in his tracks and begged van bibber for a few cents to buy food i've come all the way from chicago said the object and i haven't tasted food for twenty four hours van bibber drew away as though the object had a contagious disease in his rags and handed him a quarter without waiting to receive the man's blessing poor devil said van bibber fancy going without dinner all day he could not fancy this though he tried and the impossibility of it impressed him so much that he amiably determined to go back and hunt up the"
