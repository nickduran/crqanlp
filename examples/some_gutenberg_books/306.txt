almost as if he had been aware of her lurking doubts and had wanted the air cleared as much as she did it was as clear thank heaven as the bright outer light that surprised her almost with a touch of summer when she issued from the house for her daily round of the gardens she had left boyne at his desk indulging herself as she passed the library door by a last peep at his quiet face where he bent pipe in his mouth above his papers and now she had her own morning's task to perform the task involved on such charmed winter days almost as much delighted loitering about the different quarters of her demesne as if spring were already at work on shrubs and borders there were such inexhaustible possibilities still before her such opportunities to bring out the latent graces of the old place without a single irreverent touch of alteration that the winter months were all too short to plan what spring and autumn executed and her recovered sense of safety gave on this particular morning a peculiar zest to her progress through the sweet still place she went first to the kitchen garden where the espaliered pear trees drew complicated patterns on the walls and pigeons were fluttering and preening about the silvery slated roof of their cot there was something wrong about the piping of the hothouse and she was expecting an authority from dorchester who was to drive out between trains and make a diagnosis of the boiler but when she dipped into the damp heat of the greenhouses among the spiced scents and waxy pinks and reds of old fashioned exotics even the flora of lyng was in the note she learned that the great man had not arrived and the day being too rare to waste in an artificial atmosphere she came out again and paced slowly along the springy turf of the bowling green to the gardens behind the house at their farther end rose a grass terrace commanding over the fish pond and the yew hedges a view of the long house front with its twisted chimney stacks and the blue shadows of its roof angles all drenched in the pale gold moisture of the air seen thus across the level tracery of the yews under the suffused mild light it sent her from its open windows and hospitably smoking chimneys the look of some warm human presence of a mind slowly ripened on a sunny wall of experience she had never before had so deep a sense of her intimacy with it such a conviction that its secrets were all beneficent kept as they said to children for one's good so complete a trust in its power to gather up her life and ned's into the harmonious pattern of the long long story it sat there weaving in the sun she heard steps behind her and turned expecting to see the gardener accompanied by the engineer from dorchester but only one figure was in sight that of a youngish slightly built man who for reasons she could not on the spot have specified did not remotely resemble her preconceived notion of an authority on hot house boilers the new comer on seeing her lifted his hat and paused with the air of a gentleman perhaps a traveler desirous of having it immediately known that his intrusion is involuntary the local fame of lyng occasionally attracted the more intelligent sight seer and mary half expected to see the stranger dissemble a camera or justify his presence by producing it but he made no gesture of any sort and after a moment she asked in a tone responding to the courteous deprecation of his attitude is there any one you wish to see i came to see mr boyne he replied his intonation rather than his accent was faintly american and mary at the familiar note looked at him more closely the brim of his soft felt hat cast a shade on his face which thus obscured wore to her short sighted gaze a look of seriousness as of a person arriving on business and civilly but firmly aware of his rights past experience had made mary equally sensible to such claims but she was jealous of her husband's morning hours and doubtful of his having given any one the right to intrude on them have you an appointment with mr boyne she asked he hesitated as if unprepared for the question not exactly an appointment he replied then i'm afraid this being his working time that he can't receive you now will you give me a message or come back later the visitor again lifting his hat briefly replied that he would come back later and walked away as if to regain the front of the house as his figure receded down the walk between the yew hedges mary saw him pause and look up an instant at the peaceful house front bathed in faint winter sunshine and it struck her with a tardy touch of compunction that it would have been more humane to ask if he had come from a distance and to offer in that case to inquire if her husband could receive him but as the thought occurred to her he passed out of sight behind a pyramidal yew and at the same moment her attention was distracted by the approach of the gardener attended by the bearded pepper and salt figure of the boiler maker from dorchester the encounter with this authority led to such far reaching issues that they resulted in his finding it expedient to ignore his train and beguiled mary into spending the remainder of the morning in absorbed confabulation among the greenhouses she was startled to find when the colloquy ended that it was nearly luncheon time and she half expected as she hurried back to the house to see her husband coming out to meet her but she found no one in the court but an under gardener raking the gravel and the hall when she entered it was so silent that she guessed boyne to be still at work behind the closed door of the library not wishing to disturb him she turned into the drawing room and there at her writing table lost herself in renewed calculations of the outlay to which the morning's conference had committed her the knowledge that she could permit herself such follies had not yet lost its novelty and somehow in contrast to the vague apprehensions of the previous days it now seemed an element of her recovered security of the sense that as ned had said things in general had never been righter she was still luxuriating in a lavish play of figures when the parlor maid from the threshold roused her with a dubiously worded inquiry as to the expediency of serving luncheon it was one of their jokes that trimmle announced luncheon as if she were divulging a state secret and mary intent upon her papers merely murmured an absent minded assent she felt trimmle wavering expressively on the threshold as if in rebuke of such offhand acquiescence then her retreating steps sounded down the passage and mary pushing away her papers crossed the hall and went to the library door it was still closed and she wavered in her turn disliking to disturb her husband yet anxious that he should not exceed his normal measure of work as she stood there balancing her impulses the esoteric trimmle returned with the announcement of luncheon and mary thus impelled opened the door and went into the library boyne was not at his desk and she peered about her expecting to discover him at the book shelves somewhere down the length of the room but her call brought no response and gradually it became clear to her that he was not in the library she turned back to the parlor maid mr boyne must be up stairs please tell him that luncheon is ready the parlor maid appeared to hesitate between the obvious duty of obeying orders and an equally obvious conviction of the foolishness of the injunction laid upon her the struggle resulted in her saying doubtfully if you please madam mr boyne's not up stairs not in his room are you sure i'm sure madam mary consulted the clock where is he then he's gone out trimmle announced with the superior air of one who has respectfully waited for the question that a well ordered mind would have first propounded mary's previous conjecture had been right then boyne must have gone to the gardens to meet her and since she had missed him it was clear that he had taken the shorter way by the south door instead of going round to the court she crossed the hall to the glass portal opening directly on the yew garden but the parlor maid after another moment of inner conflict decided to bring out recklessly please madam mr boyne didn't go that way mary turned back where did he go and when he went out of the front door up the drive madam it was a matter of principle with trimmle never to answer more than one question at a time up the drive at this hour mary went to the door herself and glanced across the court through the long tunnel of bare limes but its perspective was as empty as when she had scanned it on entering the house did mr boyne leave no message she asked trimmle seemed to surrender herself to a last struggle with the forces of chaos no madam he just went out with the gentleman the gentleman what gentleman mary wheeled about as if to front this new factor the gentleman who called madam said trimmle resignedly when did a gentleman call do explain yourself trimmle only the fact that mary was very hungry and that she wanted to consult her husband about the greenhouses would have caused her to lay so unusual an injunction on her attendant and even now she was detached enough to note in trimmle's eye the dawning defiance of the respectful subordinate who has been pressed too hard i couldn't exactly say the hour madam because i didn't let the gentleman in she replied with the air of magnanimously ignoring the irregularity of her mistress's course you didn't let him in no madam when the bell rang i was dressing and agnes go and ask agnes then mary interjected trimmle still wore her look of patient magnanimity agnes would not know madam for she had unfortunately burnt her hand in trying the wick of the new lamp from town trimmle as mary was aware had always been opposed to the new lamp and so mrs dockett sent the kitchen maid instead mary looked again at the clock it's after two go and ask the kitchen maid if mr boyne left any word she went into luncheon without waiting and trimmle presently brought her there the kitchen maid's statement that the gentleman had called about one o'clock that mr boyne had gone out with him without leaving any message the kitchen maid did not even know the caller's name for he had written it on a slip of paper which he had folded and handed to her with the injunction to deliver it at once to mr boyne mary finished her luncheon still wondering and when it was over and trimmle had brought the coffee to the drawing room her wonder had deepened to a first faint tinge of disquietude it was unlike boyne to absent himself without explanation at so unwonted an hour and the difficulty of identifying the visitor whose summons he had apparently obeyed made his disappearance the more unaccountable mary boyne's experience as the wife of a busy engineer subject to sudden calls and compelled to keep irregular hours had trained her to the philosophic acceptance of surprises but since boyne's withdrawal from business he had adopted a benedictine regularity of life as if to make up for the dispersed and agitated years with their stand up lunches and dinners rattled down to the joltings of the dining car he cultivated the last refinements of punctuality and monotony discouraging his wife's fancy for the unexpected and declaring that to a delicate taste there were infinite gradations of pleasure in the fixed recurrences of habit still since no life can completely defend itself from the unforeseen it was evident that all boyne's precautions would sooner or later prove unavailable and mary concluded that he had cut short a tiresome visit by walking with his caller to the station or at least accompanying him for part of the way this conclusion relieved her from farther preoccupation and she went out herself to take up her conference with the gardener thence she walked to the village post office a mile or so away and when she turned toward home the early twilight was setting in she had taken a foot path across the downs and as boyne meanwhile had probably returned from the station by the highroad there was little likelihood of their meeting on the way she felt sure however of his having reached the house before her so sure that when she entered it herself without even pausing to inquire of trimmle she made directly for the library but the library was still empty and with an unwonted precision of visual memory she immediately observed that the papers on her husband's desk lay precisely as they had lain when she had gone in to call him to luncheon then of a sudden she was seized by a vague dread of the unknown she had closed the door behind her on entering and as she stood alone in the long silent shadowy room her dread seemed to take shape and sound to be there audibly breathing and lurking among the shadows her short sighted eyes strained through them half discerning an actual presence something aloof that watched and knew and in the recoil from that intangible propinquity she threw herself suddenly on the bell rope and gave it a desperate pull the long quavering summons brought trimmle in precipitately with a lamp and mary breathed again at this sobering reappearance of the usual you may bring tea if mr boyne is in she said to justify her ring very well madam but mr boyne is not in said trimmle putting down the lamp not in you mean he's come back and gone out again no madam he's never been back the dread stirred again and mary knew that now it had her fast not since he went out with the gentleman not since he went out with the gentleman but who was the gentleman mary gasped out with the sharp note of some one trying to be heard through a confusion of meaningless noises that i couldn't say madam trimmle standing there by the lamp seemed suddenly to grow less round and rosy as though eclipsed by the same creeping shade of apprehension but the kitchen maid knows wasn't it the kitchen maid who let him in she doesn't know either madam for he wrote his name on a folded paper mary through her agitation was aware that they were both designating the unknown visitor by a vague pronoun instead of the conventional formula which till then had kept their allusions within the bounds of custom and at the same moment her mind caught at the suggestion of the folded paper but he must have a name where is the paper she moved to the desk and began to turn over the scattered documents that littered it the first that caught her eye was an unfinished letter in her husband's hand with his pen lying across it as though dropped there at a sudden summons my dear parvis who was parvis i have just received your letter announcing elwell's death and while i suppose there is now no farther risk of trouble it might be safer she tossed the sheet aside and continued her search but no folded paper was discoverable among the letters and pages of manuscript which had been swept together in a promiscuous heap as if by a hurried or a startled gesture but the kitchen maid saw him send her here she commanded wondering at her dullness in not thinking sooner of so simple a solution trimmle at the behest vanished in a flash as if thankful to be out of the room and when she reappeared conducting the agitated underling mary had regained her self possession and had her questions pat the gentleman was a stranger yes that she understood but what had he said and above all what had he looked like the first question was easily enough answered for the disconcerting reason that he had said so little had merely asked for mr boyne and scribbling something on a bit of paper had requested that it should at once be carried in to him then you don't know what he wrote you're not sure it was his name the kitchen maid was not sure but supposed it was since he had written it in answer to her inquiry as to whom she should announce and when you carried the paper in to mr boyne what did he say the kitchen maid did not think that mr boyne had said anything but she could not be sure for just as she had handed him the paper and he was opening it she had become aware that the visitor had followed her into the library and she had slipped out leaving the two gentlemen together but then if you left them in the library how do you know that they went out of the house this question plunged the witness into momentary inarticulateness from which she was rescued by trimmle who by means of ingenious circumlocutions elicited the statement that before she could cross the hall to the back passage she had heard the gentlemen behind her and had seen them go out of the front door together then if you saw the gentleman twice you must be able to tell me what he looked like but with this final challenge to her powers of expression it became clear that the limit of the kitchen maid's endurance had been reached the obligation of going to the front door to show in a visitor was in itself so subversive of the fundamental order of things that it had thrown her faculties into hopeless disarray and she could only stammer out after various panting efforts at evocation his hat mum was different like as you might say different how different mary flashed out at her her own mind in the same instant leaping back to an image left on it that morning but temporarily lost under layers of subsequent impressions his hat had a wide brim you mean and his face was pale a youngish face mary pressed her with a white lipped intensity of interrogation but if the kitchen maid found any adequate answer to this challenge it was swept away for her listener down the rushing current of her own convictions the stranger the stranger in the garden why had mary not thought of him before she needed no one now to tell her that it was he who had called for her husband and gone away with him but who was he and why had boyne obeyed his call iv it leaped out at her suddenly like a grin out of the dark that they had often called england so little such a confoundedly hard place to get lost in a confoundedly hard place to get lost in that had been her husband's phrase and now with the whole machinery of official investigation sweeping its flash lights from shore to shore and across the dividing straits now with boyne's name blazing from the walls of every town and village his portrait how that wrung her hawked up and down the country like the image of a hunted criminal now the little compact populous island so policed surveyed and administered revealed itself as a sphinx like guardian of abysmal mysteries staring back into his wife's anguished eyes as if with the malicious joy of knowing something they would never know in the fortnight since boyne's disappearance there had been no word of him no trace of his movements even the usual misleading reports that raise expectancy in tortured bosoms had been few and fleeting no one but the bewildered kitchen maid had seen him leave the house and no one else had seen the gentleman who accompanied him all inquiries in the neighborhood failed to elicit the memory of a stranger's presence that day in the neighborhood of lyng and no one had met edward boyne either alone or in company in any of the neighboring villages or on the road across the downs or at either of the local railway stations the sunny english noon had swallowed him as completely as if he had gone out into cimmerian night mary while every external means of investigation was working at its highest pressure had ransacked her husband's papers for any trace of antecedent complications of entanglements or obligations unknown to her that might throw a faint ray into the darkness but if any such had existed in the background of boyne's life they had disappeared as completely as the slip of paper on which the visitor had written his name there remained no possible thread of guidance except if it were indeed an exception the letter which boyne had apparently been in the act of writing when he received his mysterious summons that letter read and reread by his wife and submitted by her to the police yielded little enough for conjecture to feed on i have just heard of elwell's death and while i suppose there is now no farther risk of trouble it might be safer that was all the risk of trouble was easily explained by the newspaper clipping which had apprised mary of the suit brought against her husband by one of his associates in the blue star enterprise the only new information conveyed in the letter was the fact of its showing boyne when he wrote it to be still apprehensive of the results of the suit though he had assured his wife that it had been withdrawn and though the letter itself declared that the plaintiff was dead it took several weeks of exhaustive cabling to fix the identity of the parvis to whom the fragmentary communication was addressed but even after these inquiries had shown him to be a waukesha lawyer no new facts concerning the elwell suit were elicited he appeared to have had no direct concern in it but to have been conversant with the facts merely as an acquaintance and possible intermediary and he declared himself unable to divine with what object boyne intended to seek his assistance this negative information sole fruit of the first fortnight's feverish search was not increased by a jot during the slow weeks that followed mary knew that the investigations were still being carried on but she had a vague sense of their gradually slackening as the actual march of time seemed to slacken it was as though the days flying horror struck from the shrouded image of the one inscrutable day gained assurance as the distance lengthened till at last they fell back into their normal gait and so with the human imaginations at work on the dark event no doubt it occupied them still but week by week and hour by hour it grew less absorbing took up less space was slowly but inevitably crowded out of the foreground of consciousness by the new problems perpetually bubbling up from the vaporous caldron of human experience even mary boyne's consciousness gradually felt the same lowering of velocity it still swayed with the incessant oscillations of conjecture but they were slower more rhythmical in their beat there were moments of overwhelming lassitude when like the victim of some poison which leaves the brain clear but holds the body motionless she saw herself domesticated with the horror accepting its perpetual presence as one of the fixed conditions of life these moments lengthened into hours and days till she passed into a phase of stolid acquiescence she watched the familiar routine of life with the incurious eye of a savage on whom the meaningless processes of civilization make but the faintest impression she had come to regard herself as part of the routine a spoke of the wheel revolving with its motion she felt almost like the furniture of the room in which she sat an insensate object to be dusted and pushed about with the chairs and tables and this deepening apathy held her fast at lyng in spite of the urgent entreaties of friends and the usual medical recommendation of change her friends supposed that her refusal to move was inspired by the belief that her husband would one day return to the spot from which he had vanished and a beautiful legend grew up about this imaginary state of waiting but in reality she had no such belief the depths of anguish inclosing her were no longer lighted by flashes of hope she was sure that boyne would never come back that he had gone out of her sight as completely as if death itself had waited that day on the threshold she had even renounced one by one the various theories as to his disappearance which had been advanced by the press the police and her own agonized imagination in sheer lassitude her mind turned from these alternatives of horror and sank back into the blank fact that he was gone no she would never know what had become of him no one would ever know but the house knew the library in which she spent her long lonely evenings knew for it was here that the last scene had been enacted here that the stranger had come and spoken the word which had caused boyne to rise and follow him the floor she trod had felt his tread the books on the shelves had seen his face and there were moments when the intense consciousness of the old dusky walls seemed about to break out into some audible revelation of their secret but the revelation never came and she knew it would never come lyng was not one of the garrulous old houses that betray the secrets intrusted to them its very legend proved that it had always been the mute accomplice the incorruptible custodian of the mysteries it had surprised and mary boyne sitting face to face with its portentous silence felt the futility of seeking to break it by any human means v i don't say it wasn't straight yet don't say it was straight it was business mary at the words lifted her head with a start and looked intently at the speaker when half an hour before a card with mr parvis on it had been brought up to her she had been immediately aware that the name had been a part of her consciousness ever since she had read it at the head of boyne's unfinished letter in the library she had found awaiting her a small neutral tinted man with a bald head and gold eye glasses and it sent a strange tremor through her to know that this was the person to whom her husband's last known thought had been directed parvis civilly but without vain preamble in the manner of a man who has his watch in his hand had set forth the object of his visit he had run over to england on business and finding himself in the neighborhood of dorchester had not wished to leave it without paying his respects to mrs boyne without asking her if the occasion offered what she meant to do about bob elwell's family the words touched the spring of some obscure dread in mary's bosom did her visitor after all know what boyne had meant by his unfinished phrase she asked for an elucidation of his question and noticed at once that he seemed surprised at her continued ignorance of the subject was it possible that she really knew as little as she said i know nothing you must tell me she faltered out and her visitor thereupon proceeded to unfold his story it threw even to her confused perceptions and imperfectly initiated vision a lurid glare on the whole hazy episode of the blue star mine her husband had made his money in that brilliant speculation at the cost of getting ahead of some one less alert to seize the chance the victim of his ingenuity was young robert elwell who had put him on to the blue star scheme parvis at mary's first startled cry had thrown her a sobering glance through his impartial glasses bob elwell wasn't smart enough that's all if he had been he might have turned round and served boyne the same way it's the kind of thing that happens every day in business i guess it's what the scientists call the survival of the fittest said mr parvis evidently pleased with the aptness of his analogy mary felt a physical shrinking from the next question she tried to frame it was as though the words on her lips had a taste that nauseated her but then you accuse my husband of doing something dishonorable mr parvis surveyed the question dispassionately oh no i don't i don't even"
