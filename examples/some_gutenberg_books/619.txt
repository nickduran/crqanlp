"1" "most vulgar young person i ever met do you know that he is meddling with your father's affairs in a most uncalled for most and being at a loss for an epithet sufficiently injurious he finished his expressions of horror by muttering good heavens in a manner that had been found very efficacious in clerical meetings of the diocese he must for the moment have forgotten where he was as to his vulgarity archdeacon mrs grantly had never assumed a more familiar term than this in addressing her husband i don't agree with you not that i like mr bold he is a great deal too conceited for me but then eleanor does and it would be the best thing in the world for papa if they were to marry bold would never trouble himself about hiram's hospital if he were papa's son in law and the lady turned herself round under the bed clothes in a manner to which the doctor was well accustomed and which told him as plainly as words that as far as she was concerned the subject was over for that night good heavens murmured the doctor again he was evidently much put beside himself dr grantly is by no means a bad man he is exactly the man which such an education as his was most likely to form his intellect being sufficient for such a place in the world but not sufficient to put him in advance of it he performs with a rigid constancy such of the duties of a parish clergyman as are to his thinking above the sphere of his curate but it is as an archdeacon that he shines we believe as a general rule that either a bishop or his archdeacons have sinecures where a bishop works archdeacons have but little to do and _vice versa_ in the diocese of barchester the archdeacon of barchester does the work in that capacity he is diligent authoritative and as his friends particularly boast judicious his great fault is an overbearing assurance of the virtues and claims of his order and his great foible is an equally strong confidence in the dignity of his own manner and the eloquence of his own words he is a moral man believing the precepts which he teaches and believing also that he acts up to them though we cannot say that he would give his coat to the man who took his cloak or that he is prepared to forgive his brother even seven times he is severe enough in exacting his dues considering that any laxity in this respect would endanger the security of the church and could he have his way he would consign to darkness and perdition not only every individual reformer but every committee and every commission that would even dare to ask a question respecting the appropriation of church revenues they are church revenues the laity admit it surely the church is able to administer her own revenues twas thus he was accustomed to argue when the sacrilegious doings of lord john russell and others were discussed either at barchester or at oxford it was no wonder that dr grantly did not like john bold and that his wife's suggestion that he should become closely connected with such a man dismayed him to give him his due the archdeacon never wanted courage he was quite willing to meet his enemy on any field and with any weapon he had that belief in his own arguments that he felt sure of success could he only be sure of a fair fight on the part of his adversary he had no idea that john bold could really prove that the income of the hospital was malappropriated why then should peace be sought for on such base terms what bribe an unbelieving enemy of the church with the sister in law of one dignitary and the daughter of another with a young lady whose connections with the diocese and chapter of barchester were so close as to give her an undeniable claim to a husband endowed with some of its sacred wealth when dr grantly talks of unbelieving enemies he does not mean to imply want of belief in the doctrines of the church but an equally dangerous scepticism as to its purity in money matters mrs grantly is not usually deaf to the claims of the high order to which she belongs she and her husband rarely disagree as to the tone with which the church should be defended how singular then that in such a case as this she should be willing to succumb the archdeacon again murmurs good heavens as he lays himself beside her but he does so in a voice audible only to himself and he repeats it till sleep relieves him from deep thought mr harding himself has seen no reason why his daughter should not love john bold he has not been unobservant of her feelings and perhaps his deepest regret at the part which he fears bold is about to take regarding the hospital arises from the dread that he may be separated from his daughter or that she may be separated from the man she loves he has never spoken to eleanor about her lover he is the last man in the world to allude to such a subject unconsulted even with his own daughter and had he considered that he had ground to disapprove of bold he would have removed her or forbidden him his house but he saw no such ground he would probably have preferred a second clerical son in law for mr harding also is attached to his order and failing in that he would at any rate have wished that so near a connection should have thought alike with him on church matters he would not however reject the man his daughter loved because he differed on such subjects with himself hitherto bold had taken no steps in the matter in any way annoying to mr harding personally some months since after a severe battle which cost him not a little money he gained a victory over a certain old turnpike woman in the neighbourhood of whose charges another old woman had complained to him he got the act of parliament relating to the trust found that his _protegee_ had been wrongly taxed rode through the gate himself paying the toll then brought an action against the gate keeper and proved that all people coming up a certain by lane and going down a certain other by lane were toll free the fame of his success spread widely abroad and he began to be looked on as the upholder of the rights of the poor of barchester not long after this success he heard from different quarters that hiram's bedesmen were treated as paupers whereas the property to which they were in effect heirs was very large and he was instigated by the lawyer whom he had employed in the case of the turnpike to call upon mr chadwick for a statement as to the funds of the estate bold had often expressed his indignation at the malappropriation of church funds in general in the hearing of his friend the precentor but the conversation had never referred to anything at barchester and when finney the attorney induced him to interfere with the affairs of the hospital it was against mr chadwick that his efforts were to be directed bold soon found that if he interfered with mr chadwick as steward he must also interfere with mr harding as warden and though he regretted the situation in which this would place him he was not the man to flinch from his undertaking from personal motives as soon as he had determined to take the matter in hand he set about his work with his usual energy he got a copy of john hiram's will of the wording of which he made himself perfectly master he ascertained the extent of the property and as nearly as he could the value of it and made out a schedule of what he was informed was the present distribution of its income armed with these particulars he called on mr chadwick having given that gentleman notice of his visit and asked him for a statement of the income and expenditure of the hospital for the last twenty five years this was of course refused mr chadwick alleging that he had no authority for making public the concerns of a property in managing which he was only a paid servant and who is competent to give you that authority mr chadwick asked bold only those who employ me mr bold said the steward and who are those mr chadwick demanded bold mr chadwick begged to say that if these inquiries were made merely out of curiosity he must decline answering them if mr bold had any ulterior proceeding in view perhaps it would be desirable that any necessary information should be sought for in a professional way by a professional man mr chadwick's attorneys were messrs cox and cummins of lincoln's inn mr bold took down the address of cox and cummins remarked that the weather was cold for the time of the year and wished mr chadwick good morning mr chadwick said it was cold for june and bowed him out he at once went to his lawyer finney now bold was not very fond of his attorney but as he said he merely wanted a man who knew the forms of law and who would do what he was told for his money he had no idea of putting himself in the hands of a lawyer he wanted law from a lawyer as he did a coat from a tailor because he could not make it so well himself and he thought finney the fittest man in barchester for his purpose in one respect at any rate he was right finney was humility itself finney advised an instant letter to cox and cummins mindful of his six and eightpence slap at them at once mr bold demand categorically and explicitly a full statement of the affairs of the hospital suppose i were to see mr harding first suggested bold yes yes by all means said the acquiescing finney though perhaps as mr harding is no man of business it may lead lead to some little difficulties but perhaps you're right mr bold i don't think seeing mr harding can do any harm finney saw from the expression of his client's face that he intended to have his own way chapter iii the bishop of barchester bold at once repaired to the hospital the day was now far advanced but he knew that mr harding dined in the summer at four that eleanor was accustomed to drive in the evening and that he might therefore probably find mr harding alone it was between seven and eight when he reached the slight iron gate leading into the precentor's garden and though as mr chadwick observed the day had been cold for june the evening was mild and soft and sweet the little gate was open as he raised the latch he heard the notes of mr harding's violoncello from the far end of the garden and advancing before the house and across the lawn he found him playing and not without an audience the musician was seated in a garden chair just within the summer house so as to allow the violoncello which he held between his knees to rest upon the dry stone flooring before him stood a rough music desk on which was open a page of that dear sacred book that much laboured and much loved volume of church music which had cost so many guineas and around sat and lay and stood and leaned ten of the twelve old men who dwelt with him beneath old john hiram's roof the two reformers were not there i will not say that in their hearts they were conscious of any wrong done or to be done to their mild warden but latterly they had kept aloof from him and his music was no longer to their taste it was amusing to see the positions and eager listening faces of these well to do old men i will not say that they all appreciated the music which they heard but they were intent on appearing to do so pleased at being where they were they were determined as far as in them lay to give pleasure in return and they were not unsuccessful it gladdened the precentor's heart to think that the old bedesmen whom he loved so well admired the strains which were to him so full of almost ecstatic joy and he used to boast that such was the air of the hospital as to make it a precinct specially fit for the worship of st cecilia immediately before him on the extreme corner of the bench which ran round the summer house sat one old man with his handkerchief smoothly lain upon his knees who did enjoy the moment or acted enjoyment well he was one on whose large frame many years for he was over eighty had made small havoc he was still an upright burly handsome figure with an open ponderous brow round which clung a few though very few thin gray locks the coarse black gown of the hospital the breeches and buckled shoes became him well and as he sat with his hands folded on his staff and his chin resting on his hands he was such a listener as most musicians would be glad to welcome this man was certainly the pride of the hospital it had always been the custom that one should be selected as being to some extent in authority over the others and though mr bunce for such was his name and so he was always designated by his inferior brethren had no greater emoluments than they he had assumed and well knew how to maintain the dignity of his elevation the precentor delighted to call him his sub warden and was not ashamed occasionally when no other guest was there to bid him sit down by the same parlour fire and drink the full glass of port which was placed near him bunce never went without the second glass but no entreaty ever made him take a third well well mr harding you're too good much too good he'd always say as the second glass was filled but when that was drunk and the half hour over bunce stood erect and with a benediction which his patron valued retired to his own abode he knew the world too well to risk the comfort of such halcyon moments by prolonging them till they were disagreeable mr bunce as may be imagined was most strongly opposed to innovation not even dr grantly had a more holy horror of those who would interfere in the affairs of the hospital he was every inch a churchman and though he was not very fond of dr grantly personally that arose from there not being room in the hospital for two people so much alike as the doctor and himself rather than from any dissimilarity in feeling mr bunce was inclined to think that the warden and himself could manage the hospital without further assistance and that though the bishop was the constitutional visitor and as such entitled to special reverence from all connected with john hiram's will john hiram never intended that his affairs should be interfered with by an archdeacon at the present moment however these cares were off his mind and he was looking at his warden as though he thought the music heavenly and the musician hardly less so as bold walked silently over the lawn mr harding did not at first perceive him and continued to draw his bow slowly across the plaintive wires but he soon found from his audience that some stranger was there and looking up began to welcome his young friend with frank hospitality pray mr harding pray don't let me disturb you said bold you know how fond i am of sacred music oh it's nothing said the precentor shutting up the book and then opening it again as he saw the delightfully imploring look of his old friend bunce oh bunce bunce bunce i fear that after all thou art but a flatterer well i'll just finish it then it's a favourite little bit of bishop's and then mr bold we'll have a stroll and a chat till eleanor comes in and gives us tea and so bold sat down on the soft turf to listen or rather to think how after such sweet harmony he might best introduce a theme of so much discord to disturb the peace of him who was so ready to welcome him kindly bold thought that the performance was soon over for he felt that he had a somewhat difficult task and he almost regretted the final leave taking of the last of the old men slow as they were in going through their adieux bold's heart was in his mouth as the precentor made some ordinary but kind remark as to the friendliness of the visit one evening call said he is worth ten in the morning it's all formality in the morning real social talk never begins till after dinner that's why i dine early so as to get as much as i can of it quite true mr harding said the other but i fear i've reversed the order of things and i owe you much apology for troubling you on business at such an hour but it is on business that i have called just now mr harding looked blank and annoyed there was something in the tone of the young man's voice which told him that the interview was intended to be disagreeable and he shrank back at finding his kindly greeting so repulsed i wish to speak to you about the hospital continued bold well well anything i can tell you i shall be most happy it's about the accounts then my dear fellow i can tell you nothing for i'm as ignorant as a child all i know is that they pay me l800 a year go to chadwick he knows all about the accounts and now tell me will poor mary jones ever get the use of her limb again well i think she will if she's careful but mr harding i hope you won't object to discuss with me what i have to say about the hospital mr harding gave a deep long drawn sigh he did object very strongly object to discuss any such subject with john bold but he had not the business tact of mr chadwick and did not know how to relieve himself from the coming evil he sighed sadly but made no answer i have the greatest regard for you mr harding continued bold the truest respect the most sincere thank ye thank ye mr bold interjaculated the precentor somewhat impatiently i'm much obliged but never mind that i'm as likely to be in the wrong as another man quite as likely but mr harding i must express what i feel lest you should think there is personal enmity in what i'm going to do personal enmity going to do why you're not going to cut my throat nor put me into the ecclesiastical court bold tried to laugh but he couldn't he was quite in earnest and determined in his course and couldn't make a joke of it he walked on awhile in silence before he recommenced his attack during which mr harding who had still the bow in his hand played rapidly on an imaginary violoncello i fear there is reason to think that john hiram's will is not carried out to the letter mr harding said the young man at last and i have been asked to see into it very well i've no objection on earth and now we need not say another word about it only one word more mr harding chadwick has referred me to cox and cummins and i think it my duty to apply to them for some statement about the hospital in what i do i may appear to be interfering with you and i hope you will forgive me for doing so mr bold said the other stopping and speaking with some solemnity if you act justly say nothing in this matter but the truth and use no unfair weapons in carrying out your purposes i shall have nothing to forgive i presume you think i am not entitled to the income i receive from the hospital and that others are entitled to it whatever some may do i shall never attribute to you base motives because you hold an opinion opposed to my own and adverse to my interests pray do what you consider to be your duty i can give you no assistance neither will i offer you any obstacle let me however suggest to you that you can in no wise forward your views nor i mine by any discussion between us here comes eleanor and the ponies and we'll go in to tea bold however felt that he could not sit down at ease with mr harding and his daughter after what had passed and therefore excused himself with much awkward apology and merely raising his hat and bowing as he passed eleanor and the pony chair left her in disappointed amazement at his departure mr harding's demeanour certainly impressed bold with a full conviction that the warden felt that he stood on strong grounds and almost made him think that he was about to interfere without due warrant in the private affairs of a just and honourable man but mr harding himself was anything but satisfied with his own view of the case in the first place he wished for eleanor's sake to think well of bold and to like him and yet he could not but feel disgusted at the arrogance of his conduct what right had he to say that john hiram's will was not fairly carried out but then the question would arise within his heart was that will fairly acted on did john hiram mean that the warden of his hospital should receive considerably more out of the legacy than all the twelve old men together for whose behoof the hospital was built could it be possible that john bold was right and that the reverend warden of the hospital had been for the last ten years and more the unjust recipient of an income legally and equitably belonging to others what if it should be proved before the light of day that he whose life had been so happy so quiet so respected had absorbed eight thousand pounds to which he had no title and which he could never repay i do not say that he feared that such was really the case but the first shade of doubt now fell across his mind and from this evening for many a long long day our good kind loving warden was neither happy nor at ease thoughts of this kind these first moments of much misery oppressed mr harding as he sat sipping his tea absent and ill at ease poor eleanor felt that all was not right but her ideas as to the cause of the evening's discomfort did not go beyond her lover and his sudden and uncivil departure she thought there must have been some quarrel between bold and her father and she was half angry with both though she did not attempt to explain to herself why she was so mr harding thought long and deeply over these things both before he went to bed and after it as he lay awake questioning within himself the validity of his claim to the income which he enjoyed it seemed clear at any rate that however unfortunate he might be at having been placed in such a position no one could say that he ought either to have refused the appointment first or to have rejected the income afterwards all the world meaning the ecclesiastical world as confined to the english church knew that the wardenship of the barchester hospital was a snug sinecure but no one had ever been blamed for accepting it to how much blame however would he have been open had he rejected it how mad would he have been thought had he declared when the situation was vacant and offered to him that he had scruples as to receiving l800 a year from john hiram's property and that he had rather some stranger should possess it how would dr grantly have shaken his wise head and have consulted with his friends in the close as to some decent retreat for the coming insanity of the poor minor canon if he was right in accepting the place it was clear to him also that he would be wrong in rejecting any part of the income attached to it the patronage was a valuable appanage of the bishopric and surely it would not be his duty to lessen the value of that preferment which had been bestowed on himself surely he was bound to stand by his order but somehow these arguments though they seemed logical were not satisfactory was john hiram's will fairly carried out that was the true question and if not was it not his especial duty to see that this was done his especial duty whatever injury it might do to his order however ill such duty might be received by his patron and his friends at the idea of his friends his mind turned unhappily to his son in law he knew well how strongly he would be supported by dr grantly if he could bring himself to put his case into the archdeacon's hands and to allow him to fight the battle but he knew also that he would find no sympathy there for his doubts no friendly feeling no inward comfort dr grantly would be ready enough to take up his cudgel against all comers on behalf of the church militant but he would do so on the distasteful ground of the church's infallibility such a contest would give no comfort to mr harding's doubts he was not so anxious to prove himself right as to be so i have said before that dr grantly was the working man of the diocese and that his father the bishop was somewhat inclined to an idle life so it was but the bishop though he had never been an active man was one whose qualities had rendered him dear to all who knew him he was the very opposite to his son he was a bland and a kind old man opposed by every feeling to authoritative demonstrations and episcopal ostentation it was perhaps well for him in his situation that his son had early in life been able to do that which he could not well do when he was younger and which he could not have done at all now that he was over seventy the bishop knew how to entertain the clergy of his diocese to talk easy small talk with the rectors wives and put curates at their ease but it required the strong hand of the archdeacon to deal with such as were refractory either in their doctrines or their lives the bishop and mr harding loved each other warmly they had grown old together and had together spent many many years in clerical pursuits and clerical conversation when one of them was a bishop and the other only a minor canon they were even then much together but since their children had married and mr harding had become warden and precentor they were all in all to each other i will not say that they managed the diocese between them but they spent much time in discussing the man who did and in forming little plans to mitigate his wrath against church delinquents and soften his aspirations for church dominion mr harding determined to open his mind and confess his doubts to his old friend and to him he went on the morning after john bold's uncourteous visit up to this period no rumour of these cruel proceedings against the hospital had reached the bishop's ears he had doubtless heard that men existed who questioned his right to present to a sinecure of l800 a year as he had heard from time to time of some special immorality or disgraceful disturbance in the usually decent and quiet city of barchester but all he did and all he was called on to do on such occasions was to shake his head and to beg his son the great dictator to see that no harm happened to the church it was a long story that mr harding had to tell before he made the bishop comprehend his own view of the case but we need not follow him through the tale at first the bishop counselled but one step recommended but one remedy had but one medicine in his whole pharmacopoeia strong enough to touch so grave a disorder he prescribed the archdeacon refer him to the archdeacon he repeated as mr harding spoke of bold and his visit the archdeacon will set you quite right about that he kindly said when his friend spoke with hesitation of the justness of his cause no man has got up all that so well as the archdeacon but the dose though large failed to quiet the patient indeed it almost produced nausea but bishop said he did you ever read john hiram's will the bishop"
