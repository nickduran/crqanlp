"1" "northerner has not learned how to pack a case of goods scientifically as have the english germans and french the south american rages to pay cubic feet rates on boxes that are three quarters empty so it was with a heavy heart but a knowing head that she faced rio de janeiro they had entered in the evening the sunset splashing the bay and the hills in the foreground and the sugar loaf mountain with an unbelievable riot of crimson and gold and orange and blue suddenly the sun jerked down as though pulled by a string and the magic purple night came up as though pulled by another well anyway i've seen that breathed emma mcchesney thankfully next morning she packed her three samples as before her heart heavy her mind on fat ed meyers coming up two weeks behind her three days in rio and already she had bumped her impatient quick thinking quick acting north american business head up against the stone wall of south american leisureliness and prejudice she meant no irreverence no impiety as she prayed meanwhile packing nos 79 65 and 48 into her personal bag o lord let fat ed meyers have bahia but please please help me to land rio and buenos aires then in smart tailored suit and hat interpreter in tow a prayer in her heart and excitement blazing in cheeks and eyes she made her way to the dock through the customs into a cab that was to take her to her arena the broad avenida exactly two hours later there dashed into the customs house a well dressed woman whose hat was very much over one ear she was running as only a woman runs when she's made up her mind to get there she came hot foot helter skelter regardless of modishly crippling skirt past officers past customs officials into the section where stood the one small sample trunk that she had ordered down in case of emergency the trunk had not gone through the customs it had not even been opened but emma mcchesney heeded not trifles like that rio de janeiro had fallen for featherlooms those three samples nos 79 65 and 48 that boasted style cut and workmanship never before seen in rio had turned the trick they were as a taste of blood to a hungry lion rio wanted more emma mcchesney was kneeling before her trunk had whipped out her key unlocked it and was swiftly selecting the numbers wanted from the trays her breath coming quickly her deft fingers choosing unerringly when an indignant voice said in portuguese it is forbidden emma mcchesney did not glance around her head was buried in the depths of the trunk but her quick ears had caught the word prohiba speak english she said and went on unpacking ingles shouted the official no then with a superhuman effort as emma mcchesney stood up her arms laden with featherloom samples of rainbow hues pare ar r r rest mrs mcchesney slammed down the trunk top locked it clutched her samples firmly and faced the enraged official go way i haven't time to be arrested this morning this is my busy day call around this evening whereupon she fled to her waiting cab leaving behind her a brazilian official stunned and raging by turns when she returned happy triumphant order laden he was standing there stunned no longer but raging still emma mcchesney had forgotten all about him the gold braided official advanced mustachios bristling a volley of portuguese burst from his long pent lips emma mcchesney glanced behind her her interpreter threw up helpless hands replying with a still more terrifying burst of vowels bewildered a little frightened mrs mcchesney stood helplessly by the official laid a none too gentle hand on her shoulder a little group of lesser officials stood comic opera fashion in the background and then emma mcchesney's new york training came to her aid she ignored the voluble interpreter she remained coolly unruffled by the fusillade of portuguese quietly she opened her hand bag and plunged her fingers deep deep therein her blue eyes gazed confidingly up into the brazilian's snapping black ones and as she withdrew her hand from the depths of her purse there passed from her white fingers to his brown ones that which is the esperanto of the nations the universal language understood from broadway to brazil the hand on her shoulder relaxed and fell away on deck once more she encountered the suave senor pages he stood at the rail surveying rio's shores with that lip curling contempt of the argentine for everything brazilian he regarded emma mcchesney's radiant face you are pleased with this this indian rio mrs mcchesney paused to gaze with him at the receding shores like it i'm afraid i haven't seen it from here it looks like coney but it buys like seattle like it well i should say i do ah senora exclaimed pages distressed wait in six days you will behold buenos aires your new york londres paris bah you shall drive with my wife and daughter through palermo you shall see jewels motors toilettes as never before and you will visit my establishment he raised an emphatic forefinger but surely emma mcchesney regarded him solemnly i promise to do that you may rely on me six days later they swept up the muddy and majestic plata whose color should have won it the name of river of gold instead of river of silver from the boat's upper deck emma mcchesney beheld a sky line which was so like the sky line of her own new york that it gave her a shock she was due for still another shock when an hour later she found herself in a maelstrom of motors cabs street cars newsboys skyscrapers pedestrians policemen subway stations where was the south american languor where the argentine inertia the rush and roar of it the bustle and the bang of it made the twenty three day voyage seem a myth i'm going to shut my eyes she told herself and then open them quickly if that little brown traffic policeman turns out to be a big red faced traffic policeman then i'm right and this is broadway and forty second shock number three came upon her entrance at the grande hotel it had been emma mcchesney's boast that her ten years on the road had familiarized her with every type grade style shape cut and mold of hotel clerk she knew him from the knickerbocker to the eagle house at waterloo iowa at the moment she entered the grande hotel she knew she had overlooked one accustomed though she was to the sartorial splendors of the man behind the desk she might easily have mistaken this one for the president of the republic in his glittering uniform he looked a pass between the supreme chancellor of the k.p s in full regalia and a prince of india during the durbar he was regal he was overwhelming he would have made the most splendid specimen of north american hotel clerk look like a scullery boy mrs mcchesney spent two whole days in buenos aires before she discovered that she could paralyze this personage with a peso a peso is forty three cents her experience at bahia and at rio de janeiro had taught her things so for two days haunted as she was by visions of fat ed meyers coming up close behind her she possessed her soul in patience and waited on the great firm of pages y hernandez rested the success of this expedition when she thought of her little trick on senor pages her blithe spirits sank suppose after all that this powerful south american should resent her little yankee joke her trunks went through the customs she secured an interpreter she arranged her samples with loving care style cut workmanship she ran over their strong points in her mind she looked at them as a mother's eyes rest fondly on the shining faces the well brushed hair the clean pinafores of her brood and her heart swelled with pride they lay on their tables the artful knickerbockers the gleaming petticoats the pink and blue pajamas the bifurcated skirts emma mcchesney ran one hand lightly over the navy blue satin folds of a sample pages or no pages you're a credit to your mother she said whimsically up in her room once more she selected her smartest tailor costume her most modish hat the freshest of gloves and blouses she chose the hours between four and six when wheel traffic was suspended in the calle florida and throughout the shopping district the narrow streets of which are congested to the point of suffocation at other times as she swung down the street they turned to gaze after her these argentines the fat senoras turned and the smartly costumed sallow senoritas and the men all of them they spoke to her these last but she had expected that and marched on with her free swinging stride her chin high her color very bright into the great shop of pages y hernandez at last up to the private offices her breath coming a little quickly into the presence of the shiny secretary shiny teeth shiny hair shiny skin shiny nails he gazed upon emma mcchesney the shine gleaming brighter he took in his slim brown fingers the card on which senor pages had scribbled that day on board ship the shine became dazzling he bowed low and backed his way into the office of senor pages a successful man is most impressive when in those surroundings which have been built up by his success on shipboard senor pages had been a genial charming distinguished fellow passenger in his luxurious business office he still was genial charming but his environment seemed to lend him a certain austerity senora mcchesney how awful that sounds emma mcchesney told herself we spoke of you but last night and now you come to win the wager yes he smiled but shook his head yes replied emma mcchesney and tried to smile too senor pages waved a hand toward the outer office she is with you this business friend who is also so charming oh yes said emma mcchesney she's she's with me then as he made a motion toward the push button which would summon the secretary no don't do that wait a minute from her bag she drew her business card presented it read that first senor pages read it he looked up then he read it again he gazed again at emma mcchesney emma mcchesney looked straight at him and tried in vain to remember ever having heard of the south american's sense of humor a moment passed her heart sank then senor pages threw back his fine head and laughed laughed as the latin laughs emphasizing his mirth with many ejaculations and gestures ah you northerners you are too quick for us come i myself must see this garment which you honor by selling his glance rested approvingly on emma mcchesney's trim smart figure that which you sell it must be quite right i not only sell it said emma mcchesney i wear it that how is it you northerners say ah yes that settles it six weeks later in his hotel room in columbus ohio t a buck sat reading a letter forwarded from new york and postmarked argentina as he read he chuckled grew serious chuckled again and allowed his cigar to grow cold for the seventh time dear t a they've fallen for featherlooms the way an eskimo takes to gum drops my letter of credit is all shot to pieces but it was worth it they make you pay a separate license fee in each province and south america is just one darn province after another if they'd lump a peddler's license for 5,000 and tell you to go ahead it would be cheaper i landed pages y hernandez by a trick the best of it is the man i played it on saw the point and laughed with me we north americans brag too much about our sense of humor i thought ten years on the road had hardened me to the most fiendish efforts of a hotel chef but the food at the grande here makes a quarter inch round steak with german fried look like sherry's latest triumph you know i'm not fussy i'm the kind of woman who given her choice of ice cream or cheese for dessert will take cheese here given my choice i play safe and take neither i've reached the point where i make a meal of radishes they kill their beef in the morning and serve it for lunch it looks and tastes like an ethiop's ear but i don't care because i'm getting gorgeously thin if the radishes hold out i'll invade central america and panama i've one eye on valparaiso already i know it sounds wild but it means a future and a fortune for featherlooms i find i don't even have to talk skirts they're self sellers but i have to talk honesty and packing how did you hit it off with ella sweeney haven't seen a sign of fat ed meyers i'm getting nervous do you think he may have exploded at the equator emma but kind fortune saw fit to add a last sweet drop to emma mcchesney's already brimming cup as she reached the docks on the day of her departure clad in cool crisp white from hat to shoes her quick eye spied a red faced rotund familiar figure disembarking from the new york boat just arrived the fates grinning had planned this moment like a stage manager fat ed meyers came heavily down the gangplank his hat was off he was mopping the top of his head with a large damp handkerchief his gaze swept over the busy landing docks darted hither and thither alighted on emma mcchesney with a shock and rested there a distinct little shock went through that lady too but she waited at the foot of her boat's gangway until the unbelievably nimble meyers reached her he was a fiery spectacle his cheeks were distended his eyes protuberant he wasted no words they understood each other those two coming or going going replied emma mcchesney clean up this this bonez areez too absolutely did huh meyers stood a moment panting his little eyes glaring into her calm ones well i beat you in bahia anyway he boasted emma mcchesney snapped her fingers blithely bah for bahia she took a step or two up the gangplank and turned good by ed and good luck i can recommend the radishes but pass up the beef dangerous fat ed meyers still staring began to stutter unintelligibly his lips moving while no words came emma mcchesney held up a warning hand don't do that ed not in this climate a man of your build too i'm surprised consider the feelings of your firm fat ed meyers glared up at the white clad smiling gracious figure his hands unclenched the words came oh if only you were a man for just ten minutes he moaned ii thanks to miss morrissey it was fat ed meyers of the sans silk skirt company who first said that mrs emma mcchesney was the maude adams of the business world it was on the occasion of his being called to the carpet for his failure to make sans silks as popular as emma mcchesney's famed featherlooms he spoke in self defense heatedly it isn't featherlooms it's mcchesney her line is no better than ours it's her personality not her petticoats she's got a following that swears by her if maude adams was to open on broadway in east lynne they'd flock to see her wouldn't they well emma mcchesney could sell hoop skirts i'm telling you she could sell bustles she could sell red woolen mittens on fifth avenue the title stuck it was late in september when mrs mcchesney sunburned decidedly under weight but gloriously triumphant returned from a four months tour of south america against the earnest protests of her business partner t a buck president of the buck featherloom petticoat company she had invaded the southern continent and left it abloom with featherlooms from the plata to the canal success was no stranger to mrs mcchesney this last business victory had not turned her head but it had come perilously near to tilting that extraordinarily well balanced part a certain light in her eyes a certain set of her chin an added briskness of bearing a cocky slant of the eyebrow revealed the fact that though mrs mcchesney's feet were still on the ground she might be said to be standing on tiptoe when she had sailed from brooklyn pier that june afternoon four months before she had cast her ordinary load of business responsibilities on the unaccustomed shoulders of t a buck that elegant person although president of the company which his father had founded had never been its real head when trouble threatened in the workroom it was to mrs mcchesney that the forewoman came when an irascible customer in green bay wisconsin waxed impatient over the delayed shipment of a featherloom order it was to emma mcchesney that his typewritten protest was addressed when the office machinery needed mental oiling when a new hand demanded to be put on silk work instead of mercerized when a consignment of skirt material turned out to be more than usually metallic it was in mrs emma mcchesney's little private office that the tangle was unsnarled she walked into that little office now at nine o'clock of a brilliant september morning it was a reassuring room bright orderly workmanlike reflecting the personality of its owner she stood in the center of it now and looked about her eyes glowing lips parted she raised her hands high above her head then brought them down to her sides again with an unconsciously dramatic gesture that expressed triumph peace content relief accomplishment and a great and deep satisfaction t a buck in the doorway saw the gesture and understood not so bad to get back to it is it bad it's like a drink of cool spring water after too much champagne in those miserable south american hotels how i used to long for the orderliness and quiet of this she took off hat and coat in a vase on the desk a cluster of yellow chrysanthemums shook their shaggy heads in welcome emma mcchesney's quick eye jumped to them then to buck who had come in and was surveying the scene appreciatively you of course she indicated the flowers with a nod and a radiant smile sorry no the office staff did that there's a card of welcome i believe oh said emma mcchesney the smile was still there but the radiance was gone she seated herself at her desk buck took the chair near by she unlocked a drawer opened it rummaged closed it again unlocked another she patted the flat top of her desk with loving fingers i can't help it she said with a little shamed laugh i'm so glad to be back i'll probably hug the forewoman and bite a piece out of the first featherloom i lay hands on i had to use all my self control to keep from kissing jake the elevator man coming up out of the corner of her eye emma mcchesney had been glancing at her handsome business partner she had found herself doing the same thing from the time he had met her at the dock late in the afternoon of the day before those four months had wrought some subtle change but what where she frowned a moment in thought then is that a new suit t a this lord no last summer's put it on because of this july hangover in september why oh i don't know vaguely i just wondered there was nothing vague about t a buck however his old air of leisureliness was gone his very attitude as he sat there erect brisk confident was in direct contrast to his old graceful indolence i'd like to go over the home grounds with you this morning he said of course in our talk last night we didn't cover the south american situation thoroughly but your letters and the orders told the story you carried the thing through to success it's marvelous but we stay at homes haven't been marking time during your absence the puzzled frown still sat on emma mcchesney's brow as though thinking aloud she said have you grown thinner or fatter or something not an ounce weighed at the club yesterday he leaned forward a little his face suddenly very sober emma i want to tell you now that that mother she i lost her just a few weeks after you sailed emma mcchesney gave a little cry she came quickly over to him and one hand went to his shoulder as she stood looking down at him her face all sympathy and contrition and sorrow and you didn't write me you didn't even tell me last night i didn't want to distress you i knew you were having a hard enough pull down there without additional worries it happened very suddenly while i was out on the road i got the wire in peoria she died very suddenly and quite painlessly her companion miss tate was with her she had never been herself since dad's death and you i could only do what was to be done then i went back on the road i closed up the house and now i've leased it of course it's big enough for a regiment but we stayed on because mother was used to it i sold some of the furniture but stored the things she had loved she left some to you to me you know she used to enjoy your visits so much partly because of the way in which you always talked of dad she left you some jewelry that she was fond of and that colossal old mahogany buffet that you used to rave over whenever you came up heaven knows what you'll do with it it's a white elephant if you add another story to it you could rent it out as an apartment indeed i shall take it and cherish it and polish it up myself every week the beauty she came back to her chair they sat a moment in silence then emma mcchesney spoke musingly so that was it buck looked up i sensed something different i didn't know i couldn't explain it buck passed a quick hand over his eyes shook himself sat up erect and brisk again and plunged with a directness that was as startling as it was new in him into the details of middle western business good exclaimed emma mcchesney it's all very well to know that featherlooms are safe in south america but the important thing is to know how they're going in the corn country buck stood up suppose we transfer this talk to my office all the papers are there all the correspondence all the orders everything you can get the whole situation in half an hour what's the use of talking when figures will tell you he walked swiftly over to the door and stood there waiting emma mcchesney rose the puzzled look was there again no that wasn't it after all she said eh said buck wasn't what nothing replied emma mcchesney i'm wool gathering this morning i'm afraid it's going to take me a day or two to get back into harness again if you'd rather wait if you think you'll be more fit to morrow or the day after we'll wait there's no real hurry i just thought but mrs mcchesney led the way across the hall that separated her office from her partner's halfway across she stopped and surveyed the big bright busy main office with its clacking typewriters and rustle and crackle of papers and its air of concentration why you've run up a partition there between miss casey's desk and the workroom door haven't you yes it's much better that way yes of course and why where are the boys desks spalding's and hutchinson's and they're all gone she turned in amazement break it to me aren't we using traveling men any more buck laughed his low pleasant laugh oh yes but i thought their desks belonged somewhere else than in the main office they're now installed in the little room between the shop and healy's office close quarters but better than having them out here where they were inclined to neglect their reports in order to shine in the eyes of that pretty new stenographer there are one or two other changes i hope you'll approve of them i'm sure i shall replied emma mcchesney a little stiffly in buck's office she settled back in her chair to watch him as he arranged neat sheaves of papers for her inspection her eyes traveled from his keen eager face to the piles of paper and back again tell me did you hit it off with the ella sweeneys and the sadie harrises of the great middle west is business as bad as the howlers say it is you said something last night about a novelty bifurcated skirt was that the new designer's idea how have the early buyers taken to it buck crooked an elbow over his head in self defense stop it you make me feel like rheims cathedral don't bombard until negotiations fail he handed her the first sheaf of papers but before she began to read i'll say this much miss sharp of berg brothers omaha the one you warned against as the human cactus had me up for dinner well i know you don't but it's true her father and i hit it off just like that he's a character that old boy ever meet him no and miss sharp told me something about herself that explains her porcupine pose that poor child was engaged to a chap who was killed in the spanish american war and she kate sharp interrupted emma mcchesney why t a buck in all her vinegary narrow life that girl has never had a beau much less buck's eyebrows came up slightly emma mcchesney you haven't developed er claws have you with a gasp emma mcchesney plunged into the papers before her for ten minutes the silence of the room was unbroken except for the crackling of papers then emma mcchesney put down the first sheaf and looked up at her business partner is that a fair sample she demanded very answered t a buck and handed her another set another ten minutes of silence emma mcchesney reached out a hand for still another set of papers the pink of repressed excitement was tinting her cheeks they're they're all like this practically yes mrs mcchesney faced him her eyes wide her breath coming fast t a buck she slapped the papers before her smartly with the back of her hand this means you've broken our record for middle western sales yes said t a quietly dad would have enjoyed a morning like this wouldn't he emma mcchesney stood up enjoyed it he is enjoying it don't tell me that t a senior just because he is no longer on earth has failed to get the joy of knowing that his son has realized his fondest dreams why i can feel him here in this room i can see those bright brown eyes of his twinkling behind his glasses not know it of course he knows it buck looked down at the desk smiling curiously d'you know i felt that way too suddenly emma mcchesney began to laugh it was not all mirth that laugh buck waited and to think that i i kindly and patronizingly handed you a little book full of tips on how to handle western buyers the salesman's who's who i who used to think i was the witch of the west when it came to selling you on your first selling trip have made me look like like a shoe string peddler buck put out a hand suddenly don't say that emma i somehow it takes away all the pleasure it's true and now that i know it explains a lot of things that i've been puzzling about in the last twenty four hours what kind of things the way you look and act and think the way you carry your head the way you sit in a chair the very words you use your gestures your intonations they're different t a buck busy with his cigar laughed a little self consciously oh nonsense he said you're imagining things which remark while not a particularly happy one certainly was not in itself so unfortunate as to explain why mrs mcchesney should have turned rather suddenly and bolted into her own office across the hall and closed the door behind her t a buck quite cool and unruffled viewed her sudden departure quizzically then he took his cigar from his mouth and stood eying it a moment with more attention perhaps than it deserved in spite of its fine aroma when he put it back between his lips and sat down at his desk once more he was smiling ever so slightly then began a new order of things in the offices of the t a buck featherloom petticoat company feet that once had turned quite as a matter of course toward the door marked mrs mcchesney now took the direction of the door opposite and that door bore the name of buck"
