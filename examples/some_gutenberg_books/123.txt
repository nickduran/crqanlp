"1" "point that the eyes could fathom the distance was lost in the distance that was all there was no clear cut horizontal line marking the dip of the globe below the line of vision a great light is commencing to break on me continued perry taking out his watch i believe that i have partially solved the riddle it is now two o'clock when we emerged from the prospector the sun was directly above us where is it now i glanced up to find the great orb still motionless in the center of the heaven and such a sun i had scarcely noticed it before fully thrice the size of the sun i had known throughout my life and apparently so near that the sight of it carried the conviction that one might almost reach up and touch it my god perry where are we i exclaimed this thing is beginning to get on my nerves i think that i may state quite positively david he commenced that we are but he got no further from behind us in the vicinity of the prospector there came the most thunderous awe inspiring roar that ever had fallen upon my ears with one accord we turned to discover the author of that fearsome noise had i still retained the suspicion that we were on earth the sight that met my eyes would quite entirely have banished it emerging from the forest was a colossal beast which closely resembled a bear it was fully as large as the largest elephant and with great forepaws armed with huge claws its nose or snout depended nearly a foot below its lower jaw much after the manner of a rudimentary trunk the giant body was covered by a coat of thick shaggy hair roaring horribly it came toward us at a ponderous shuffling trot i turned to perry to suggest that it might be wise to seek other surroundings the idea had evidently occurred to perry previously for he was already a hundred paces away and with each second his prodigious bounds increased the distance i had never guessed what latent speed possibilities the old gentleman possessed i saw that he was headed toward a little point of the forest which ran out toward the sea not far from where we had been standing and as the mighty creature the sight of which had galvanized him into such remarkable action was forging steadily toward me i set off after perry though at a somewhat more decorous pace it was evident that the massive beast pursuing us was not built for speed so all that i considered necessary was to gain the trees sufficiently ahead of it to enable me to climb to the safety of some great branch before it came up notwithstanding our danger i could not help but laugh at perry's frantic capers as he essayed to gain the safety of the lower branches of the trees he now had reached the stems were bare for a distance of some fifteen feet at least on those trees which perry attempted to ascend for the suggestion of safety carried by the larger of the forest giants had evidently attracted him to them a dozen times he scrambled up the trunks like a huge cat only to fall back to the ground once more and with each failure he cast a horrified glance over his shoulder at the oncoming brute simultaneously emitting terror stricken shrieks that awoke the echoes of the grim forest at length he spied a dangling creeper about the bigness of one's wrist and when i reached the trees he was racing madly up it hand over hand he had almost reached the lowest branch of the tree from which the creeper depended when the thing parted beneath his weight and he fell sprawling at my feet the misfortune now was no longer amusing for the beast was already too close to us for comfort seizing perry by the shoulder i dragged him to his feet and rushing to a smaller tree one that he could easily encircle with his arms and legs i boosted him as far up as i could and then left him to his fate for a glance over my shoulder revealed the awful beast almost upon me it was the great size of the thing alone that saved me its enormous bulk rendered it too slow upon its feet to cope with the agility of my young muscles and so i was enabled to dodge out of its way and run completely behind it before its slow wits could direct it in pursuit the few seconds of grace that this gave me found me safely lodged in the branches of a tree a few paces from that in which perry had at last found a haven did i say safely lodged at the time i thought we were quite safe and so did perry he was praying raising his voice in thanksgiving at our deliverance and had just completed a sort of paeon of gratitude that the thing couldn't climb a tree when without warning it reared up beneath him on its enormous tail and hind feet and reached those fearfully armed paws quite to the branch upon which he crouched the accompanying roar was all but drowned in perry's scream of fright and he came near tumbling headlong into the gaping jaws beneath him so precipitate was his impetuous haste to vacate the dangerous limb it was with a deep sigh of relief that i saw him gain a higher branch in safety and then the brute did that which froze us both anew with horror grasping the tree's stem with his powerful paws he dragged down with all the great weight of his huge bulk and all the irresistible force of those mighty muscles slowly but surely the stem began to bend toward him inch by inch he worked his paws upward as the tree leaned more and more from the perpendicular perry clung chattering in a panic of terror higher and higher into the bending and swaying tree he clambered more and more rapidly was the tree top inclining toward the ground i saw now why the great brute was armed with such enormous paws the use that he was putting them to was precisely that for which nature had intended them the sloth like creature was herbivorous and to feed that mighty carcass entire trees must be stripped of their foliage the reason for its attacking us might easily be accounted for on the supposition of an ugly disposition such as that which the fierce and stupid rhinoceros of africa possesses but these were later reflections at the moment i was too frantic with apprehension on perry's behalf to consider aught other than a means to save him from the death that loomed so close realizing that i could outdistance the clumsy brute in the open i dropped from my leafy sanctuary intent only on distracting the thing's attention from perry long enough to enable the old man to gain the safety of a larger tree there were many close by which not even the terrific strength of that titanic monster could bend as i touched the ground i snatched a broken limb from the tangled mass that matted the jungle like floor of the forest and leaping unnoticed behind the shaggy back dealt the brute a terrific blow my plan worked like magic from the previous slowness of the beast i had been led to look for no such marvelous agility as he now displayed releasing his hold upon the tree he dropped on all fours and at the same time swung his great wicked tail with a force that would have broken every bone in my body had it struck me but fortunately i had turned to flee at the very instant that i felt my blow land upon the towering back as it started in pursuit of me i made the mistake of running along the edge of the forest rather than making for the open beach in a moment i was knee deep in rotting vegetation and the awful thing behind me was gaining rapidly as i floundered and fell in my efforts to extricate myself a fallen log gave me an instant's advantage for climbing upon it i leaped to another a few paces farther on and in this way was able to keep clear of the mush that carpeted the surrounding ground but the zigzag course that this necessitated was placing such a heavy handicap upon me that my pursuer was steadily gaining upon me suddenly from behind i heard a tumult of howls and sharp piercing barks much the sound that a pack of wolves raises when in full cry involuntarily i glanced backward to discover the origin of this new and menacing note with the result that i missed my footing and went sprawling once more upon my face in the deep muck my mammoth enemy was so close by this time that i knew i must feel the weight of one of his terrible paws before i could rise but to my surprise the blow did not fall upon me the howling and snapping and barking of the new element which had been infused into the melee now seemed centered quite close behind me and as i raised myself upon my hands and glanced around i saw what it was that had distracted the dyryth as i afterward learned the thing is called from my trail it was surrounded by a pack of some hundred wolf like creatures wild dogs they seemed that rushed growling and snapping in upon it from all sides so that they sank their white fangs into the slow brute and were away again before it could reach them with its huge paws or sweeping tail but these were not all that my startled eyes perceived chattering and gibbering through the lower branches of the trees came a company of manlike creatures evidently urging on the dog pack they were to all appearances strikingly similar in aspect to the negro of africa their skins were very black and their features much like those of the more pronounced negroid type except that the head receded more rapidly above the eyes leaving little or no forehead their arms were rather longer and their legs shorter in proportion to the torso than in man and later i noticed that their great toes protruded at right angles from their feet because of their arboreal habits i presume behind them trailed long slender tails which they used in climbing quite as much as they did either their hands or feet i had stumbled to my feet the moment that i discovered that the wolf dogs were holding the dyryth at bay at sight of me several of the savage creatures left off worrying the great brute to come slinking with bared fangs toward me and as i turned to run toward the trees again to seek safety among the lower branches i saw a number of the man apes leaping and chattering in the foliage of the nearest tree between them and the beasts behind me there was little choice but at least there was a doubt as to the reception these grotesque parodies on humanity would accord me while there was none as to the fate which awaited me beneath the grinning fangs of my fierce pursuers and so i raced on toward the trees intending to pass beneath that which held the man things and take refuge in another farther on but the wolf dogs were very close behind me so close that i had despaired of escaping them when one of the creatures in the tree above swung down headforemost his tail looped about a great limb and grasping me beneath my armpits swung me in safety up among his fellows there they fell to examining me with the utmost excitement and curiosity they picked at my clothing my hair and my flesh they turned me about to see if i had a tail and when they discovered that i was not so equipped they fell into roars of laughter their teeth were very large and white and even except for the upper canines which were a trifle longer than the others protruding just a bit when the mouth was closed when they had examined me for a few moments one of them discovered that my clothing was not a part of me with the result that garment by garment they tore it from me amidst peals of the wildest laughter apelike they essayed to don the apparel themselves but their ingenuity was not sufficient to the task and so they gave it up in the meantime i had been straining my eyes to catch a glimpse of perry but nowhere about could i see him although the clump of trees in which he had first taken refuge was in full view i was much exercised by fear that something had befallen him and though i called his name aloud several times there was no response tired at last of playing with my clothing the creatures threw it to the ground and catching me one on either side by an arm started off at a most terrifying pace through the tree tops never have i experienced such a journey before or since even now i oftentimes awake from a deep sleep haunted by the horrid remembrance of that awful experience from tree to tree the agile creatures sprang like flying squirrels while the cold sweat stood upon my brow as i glimpsed the depths beneath into which a single misstep on the part of either of my bearers would hurl me as they bore me along my mind was occupied with a thousand bewildering thoughts what had become of perry would i ever see him again what were the intentions of these half human things into whose hands i had fallen were they inhabitants of the same world into which i had been born no it could not be but yet where else i had not left that earth of that i was sure still neither could i reconcile the things which i had seen to a belief that i was still in the world of my birth with a sigh i gave it up iii a change of masters we must have traveled several miles through the dark and dismal wood when we came suddenly upon a dense village built high among the branches of the trees as we approached it my escort broke into wild shouting which was immediately answered from within and a moment later a swarm of creatures of the same strange race as those who had captured me poured out to meet us again i was the center of a wildly chattering horde i was pulled this way and that pinched pounded and thumped until i was black and blue yet i do not think that their treatment was dictated by either cruelty or malice i was a curiosity a freak a new plaything and their childish minds required the added evidence of all their senses to back up the testimony of their eyes presently they dragged me within the village which consisted of several hundred rude shelters of boughs and leaves supported upon the branches of the trees between the huts which sometimes formed crooked streets were dead branches and the trunks of small trees which connected the huts upon one tree to those within adjoining trees the whole network of huts and pathways forming an almost solid flooring a good fifty feet above the ground i wondered why these agile creatures required connecting bridges between the trees but later when i saw the motley aggregation of half savage beasts which they kept within their village i realized the necessity for the pathways there were a number of the same vicious wolf dogs which we had left worrying the dyryth and many goatlike animals whose distended udders explained the reasons for their presence my guard halted before one of the huts into which i was pushed then two of the creatures squatted down before the entrance to prevent my escape doubtless though where i should have escaped to i certainly had not the remotest conception i had no more than entered the dark shadows of the interior than there fell upon my ears the tones of a familiar voice in prayer perry i cried dear old perry thank the lord you are safe david can it be possible that you escaped and the old man stumbled toward me and threw his arms about me he had seen me fall before the dyryth and then he had been seized by a number of the ape creatures and borne through the tree tops to their village his captors had been as inquisitive as to his strange clothing as had mine with the same result as we looked at each other we could not help but laugh with a tail david remarked perry you would make a very handsome ape maybe we can borrow a couple i rejoined they seem to be quite the thing this season i wonder what the creatures intend doing with us perry they don't seem really savage what do you suppose they can be you were about to tell me where we are when that great hairy frigate bore down upon us have you really any idea at all yes david he replied i know precisely where we are we have made a magnificent discovery my boy we have proved that the earth is hollow we have passed entirely through its crust to the inner world perry you are mad not at all david for two hundred and fifty miles our prospector bore us through the crust beneath our outer world at that point it reached the center of gravity of the five hundred mile thick crust up to that point we had been descending direction is of course merely relative then at the moment that our seats revolved the thing that made you believe that we had turned about and were speeding upward we passed the center of gravity and though we did not alter the direction of our progress yet we were in reality moving upward toward the surface of the inner world does not the strange fauna and flora which we have seen convince you that you are not in the world of your birth and the horizon could it present the strange aspects which we both noted unless we were indeed standing upon the inside surface of a sphere but the sun perry i urged how in the world can the sun shine through five hundred miles of solid crust it is not the sun of the outer world that we see here it is another sun an entirely different sun that casts its eternal noonday effulgence upon the face of the inner world look at it now david if you can see it from the doorway of this hut and you will see that it is still in the exact center of the heavens we have been here for many hours yet it is still noon and withal it is very simple david the earth was once a nebulous mass it cooled and as it cooled it shrank at length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon its outer surface a sort of shell but within it was partially molten matter and highly expanded gases as it continued to cool what happened centrifugal force hurled the particles of the nebulous center toward the crust as rapidly as they approached a solid state you have seen the same principle practically applied in the modern cream separator presently there was only a small super heated core of gaseous matter remaining within a huge vacant interior left by the contraction of the cooling gases the equal attraction of the solid crust from all directions maintained this luminous core in the exact center of the hollow globe what remains of it is the sun you saw today a relatively tiny thing at the exact center of the earth equally to every part of this inner world it diffuses its perpetual noonday light and torrid heat this inner world must have cooled sufficiently to support animal life long ages after life appeared upon the outer crust but that the same agencies were at work here is evident from the similar forms of both animal and vegetable creation which we have already seen take the great beast which attacked us for example unquestionably a counterpart of the megatherium of the post pliocene period of the outer crust whose fossilized skeleton has been found in south america but the grotesque inhabitants of this forest i urged surely they have no counterpart in the earth's history who can tell he rejoined they may constitute the link between ape and man all traces of which have been swallowed by the countless convulsions which have racked the outer crust or they may be merely the result of evolution along slightly different lines either is quite possible further speculation was interrupted by the appearance of several of our captors before the entrance of the hut two of them entered and dragged us forth the perilous pathways and the surrounding trees were filled with the black ape men their females and their young there was not an ornament a weapon or a garment among the lot quite low in the scale of creation commented perry quite high enough to play the deuce with us though i replied now what do you suppose they intend doing with us we were not long in learning as on the occasion of our trip to the village we were seized by a couple of the powerful creatures and whirled away through the tree tops while about us and in our wake raced a chattering jabbering grinning horde of sleek black ape things twice my bearers missed their footing and my heart ceased beating as we plunged toward instant death among the tangled deadwood beneath but on both occasions those lithe powerful tails reached out and found sustaining branches nor did either of the creatures loosen their grasp upon me in fact it seemed that the incidents were of no greater moment to them than would be the stubbing of one's toe at a street crossing in the outer world they but laughed uproariously and sped on with me for some time they continued through the forest how long i could not guess for i was learning what was later borne very forcefully to my mind that time ceases to be a factor the moment means for measuring it cease to exist our watches were gone and we were living beneath a stationary sun already i was puzzled to compute the period of time which had elapsed since we broke through the crust of the inner world it might be hours or it might be days who in the world could tell where it was always noon by the sun no time had elapsed but my judgment told me that we must have been several hours in this strange world presently the forest terminated and we came out upon a level plain a short distance before us rose a few low rocky hills toward these our captors urged us and after a short time led us through a narrow pass into a tiny circular valley here they got down to work and we were soon convinced that if we were not to die to make a roman holiday we were to die for some other purpose the attitude of our captors altered immediately as they entered the natural arena within the rocky hills their laughter ceased grim ferocity marked their bestial faces bared fangs menaced us we were placed in the center of the amphitheater the thousand creatures forming a great ring about us then a wolf dog was brought hyaenodon perry called it and turned loose with us inside the circle the thing's body was as large as that of a full grown mastiff its legs were short and powerful and its jaws broad and strong dark shaggy hair covered its back and sides while its breast and belly were quite white as it slunk toward us it presented a most formidable aspect with its upcurled lips baring its mighty fangs perry was on his knees praying i stooped and picked up a small stone at my movement the beast veered off a bit and commenced circling us evidently it had been a target for stones before the ape things were dancing up and down urging the brute on with savage cries until at last seeing that i did not throw he charged us at andover and later at yale i had pitched on winning ball teams my speed and control must both have been above the ordinary for i made such a record during my senior year at college that overtures were made to me in behalf of one of the great major league teams but in the tightest pitch that ever had confronted me in the past i had never been in such need for control as now as i wound up for the delivery i held my nerves and muscles under absolute command though the grinning jaws were hurtling toward me at terrific speed and then i let go with every ounce of my weight and muscle and science in back of that throw the stone caught the hyaenodon full upon the end of the nose and sent him bowling over upon his back at the same instant a chorus of shrieks and howls arose from the circle of spectators so that for a moment i thought that the upsetting of their champion was the cause but in this i soon saw that i was mistaken as i looked the ape things broke in all directions toward the surrounding hills and then i distinguished the real cause of their perturbation behind them streaming through the pass which leads into the valley came a swarm of hairy men gorilla like creatures armed with spears and hatchets and bearing long oval shields like demons they set upon the ape things and before them the hyaenodon which had now regained its senses and its feet fled howling with fright past us swept the pursued and the pursuers nor did the hairy ones accord us more than a passing glance until the arena had been emptied of its former occupants then they returned to us and one who seemed to have authority among them directed that we be brought with them when we had passed out of the amphitheater onto the great plain we saw a caravan of men and women human beings like ourselves and for the first time hope and relief filled my heart until i could have cried out in the exuberance of my happiness it is true that they were a half naked wild appearing aggregation but they at least were fashioned along the same lines as ourselves there was nothing grotesque or horrible about them as about the other creatures in this strange weird world but as we came closer our hearts sank once more for we discovered that the poor wretches were chained neck to neck in a long line and that the gorilla men were their guards with little ceremony perry and i were chained at the end of the line and without further ado the interrupted march was resumed up to this time the excitement had kept us both up but now the tiresome monotony of the long march across the sun baked plain brought on all the agonies consequent to a long denied sleep on and on we stumbled beneath that hateful noonday sun if we fell we were prodded with a sharp point our companions in chains did not stumble they strode along proudly erect occasionally they would exchange words with one another in a monosyllabic language they were a noble appearing race with well formed heads and perfect physiques the men were heavily bearded tall and muscular the women smaller and more gracefully molded with great masses of raven hair caught into loose knots upon their heads the features of both sexes were well proportioned there was not a face among them that would have been called even plain if judged by earthly standards they wore no ornaments but this i later learned was due to the fact that their captors had stripped them of everything of value as garmenture the women possessed a single robe of some light colored spotted hide rather similar in appearance to a leopard's skin this they wore either supported entirely about the waist by a leathern thong so that it hung partially below the knee on one side or possibly looped gracefully across one shoulder their feet were shod with skin sandals the men wore loin cloths of the hide of some shaggy beast long ends of which depended before and behind nearly to the ground in some instances these ends were finished with the strong talons of the beast from which the hides had been taken our guards whom i already have described as gorilla like men were rather lighter in build than a gorilla but even so they were indeed mighty creatures their arms and legs were proportioned more in conformity with human standards but their entire bodies were covered with shaggy brown hair and their faces were quite as brutal as those of the few stuffed specimens of the gorilla which i had seen in the museums at home their only redeeming feature lay in the development of the head above and back of the ears in this respect they were not one whit less human than"
