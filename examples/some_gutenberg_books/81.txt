"1" "shall never accede to your demands leave the room please you have no right here you promised not to enter very well olga i shall not enter but before i am done with you you shall wish a thousand times that you had done at once the favor i have asked in the end i shall win anyway so you might as well save trouble and time for me and disgrace for yourself and your never nikolas interrupted the woman and then tarzan saw rokoff turn and nod to paulvitch who sprang quickly toward the doorway of the cabin rushing in past rokoff who held the door open for him then the latter stepped quickly out the door closed tarzan heard the click of the lock as paulvitch turned it from the inside rokoff remained standing before the door with head bent as though to catch the words of the two within a nasty smile curled his bearded lip tarzan could hear the woman's voice commanding the fellow to leave her cabin i shall send for my husband she cried he will show you no mercy paulvitch's sneering laugh came through the polished panels the purser will fetch your husband madame said the man in fact that officer has already been notified that you are entertaining a man other than your husband behind the locked door of your cabin bah cried the woman my husband will know most assuredly your husband will know but the purser will not nor will the newspaper men who shall in some mysterious way hear of it on our landing but they will think it a fine story and so will all your friends when they read of it at breakfast on let me see this is tuesday yes when they read of it at breakfast next friday morning nor will it detract from the interest they will all feel when they learn that the man whom madame entertained is a russian servant her brother's valet to be quite exact alexis paulvitch came the woman's voice cold and fearless you are a coward and when i whisper a certain name in your ear you will think better of your demands upon me and your threats against me and then you will leave my cabin quickly nor do i think that ever again will you at least annoy me and there came a moment's silence in which tarzan could imagine the woman leaning toward the scoundrel and whispering the thing she had hinted at into his ear only a moment of silence and then a startled oath from the man the scuffling of feet a woman's scream and silence but scarcely had the cry ceased before the ape man had leaped from his hiding place rokoff started to run but tarzan grasped him by the collar and dragged him back neither spoke for both felt instinctively that murder was being done in that room and tarzan was confident that rokoff had had no intention that his confederate should go that far he felt that the man's aims were deeper than that deeper and even more sinister than brutal cold blooded murder without hesitating to question those within the ape man threw his giant shoulder against the frail panel and in a shower of splintered wood he entered the cabin dragging rokoff after him before him on a couch the woman lay and on top of her was paulvitch his fingers gripping the fair throat while his victim's hands beat futilely at his face tearing desperately at the cruel fingers that were forcing the life from her the noise of his entrance brought paulvitch to his feet where he stood glowering menacingly at tarzan the girl rose falteringly to a sitting posture upon the couch one hand was at her throat and her breath came in little gasps although disheveled and very pale tarzan recognized her as the young woman whom he had caught staring at him on deck earlier in the day what is the meaning of this said tarzan turning to rokoff whom he intuitively singled out as the instigator of the outrage the man remained silent scowling touch the button please continued the ape man we will have one of the ship's officers here this affair has gone quite far enough no no cried the girl coming suddenly to her feet please do not do that i am sure that there was no real intention to harm me i angered this person and he lost control of himself that is all i would not care to have the matter go further please monsieur and there was such a note of pleading in her voice that tarzan could not press the matter though his better judgment warned him that there was something afoot here of which the proper authorities should be made cognizant you wish me to do nothing then in the matter he asked nothing please she replied you are content that these two scoundrels should continue persecuting you she did not seem to know what answer to make and looked very troubled and unhappy tarzan saw a malicious grin of triumph curl rokoff's lip the girl evidently was in fear of these two she dared not express her real desires before them then said tarzan i shall act on my own responsibility to you he continued turning to rokoff and this includes your accomplice i may say that from now on to the end of the voyage i shall take it upon myself to keep an eye on you and should there chance to come to my notice any act of either one of you that might even remotely annoy this young woman you shall be called to account for it directly to me nor shall the calling or the accounting be pleasant experiences for either of you now get out of here and he grabbed rokoff and paulvitch each by the scruff of the neck and thrust them forcibly through the doorway giving each an added impetus down the corridor with the toe of his boot then he turned back to the stateroom and the girl she was looking at him in wide eyed astonishment and you madame will confer a great favor upon me if you will but let me know if either of those rascals troubles you further ah monsieur she answered i hope that you will not suffer for the kind deed you attempted you have made a very wicked and resourceful enemy who will stop at nothing to satisfy his hatred you must be very careful indeed monsieur pardon me madame my name is tarzan monsieur tarzan and because i would not consent to notify the officers do not think that i am not sincerely grateful to you for the brave and chivalrous protection you rendered me good night monsieur tarzan i shall never forget the debt i owe you and with a most winsome smile that displayed a row of perfect teeth the girl curtsied to tarzan who bade her good night and made his way on deck it puzzled the man considerably that there should be two on board this girl and count de coude who suffered indignities at the hands of rokoff and his companion and yet would not permit the offenders to be brought to justice before he turned in that night his thoughts reverted many times to the beautiful young woman into the evidently tangled web of whose life fate had so strangely introduced him it occurred to him that he had not learned her name that she was married had been evidenced by the narrow gold band that encircled the third finger of her left hand involuntarily he wondered who the lucky man might be tarzan saw nothing further of any of the actors in the little drama that he had caught a fleeting glimpse of until late in the afternoon of the last day of the voyage then he came suddenly face to face with the young woman as the two approached their deck chairs from opposite directions she greeted him with a pleasant smile speaking almost immediately of the affair he had witnessed in her cabin two nights before it was as though she had been perturbed by a conviction that he might have construed her acquaintance with such men as rokoff and paulvitch as a personal reflection upon herself i trust monsieur has not judged me she said by the unfortunate occurrence of tuesday evening i have suffered much on account of it this is the first time that i have ventured from my cabin since i have been ashamed she concluded simply one does not judge the gazelle by the lions that attack it replied tarzan i had seen those two work before in the smoking room the day prior to their attack on you if i recollect it correctly and so knowing their methods i am convinced that their enmity is a sufficient guarantee of the integrity of its object men such as they must cleave only to the vile hating all that is noblest and best it is very kind of you to put it that way she replied smiling i have already heard of the matter of the card game my husband told me the entire story he spoke especially of the strength and bravery of monsieur tarzan to whom he feels that he owes an immense debt of gratitude your husband repeated tarzan questioningly yes i am the countess de coude i am already amply repaid madame in knowing that i have rendered a service to the wife of the count de coude alas monsieur i already am so greatly indebted to you that i may never hope to settle my own account so pray do not add further to my obligations and she smiled so sweetly upon him that tarzan felt that a man might easily attempt much greater things than he had accomplished solely for the pleasure of receiving the benediction of that smile he did not see her again that day and in the rush of landing on the following morning he missed her entirely but there had been something in the expression of her eyes as they parted on deck the previous day that haunted him it had been almost wistful as they had spoken of the strangeness of the swift friendships of an ocean crossing and of the equal ease with which they are broken forever tarzan wondered if he should ever see her again chapter 3 what happened in the rue maule on his arrival in paris tarzan had gone directly to the apartments of his old friend d'arnot where the naval lieutenant had scored him roundly for his decision to renounce the title and estates that were rightly his from his father john clayton the late lord greystoke you must be mad my friend said d'arnot thus lightly to give up not alone wealth and position but an opportunity to prove beyond doubt to all the world that in your veins flows the noble blood of two of england's most honored houses instead of the blood of a savage she ape it is incredible that they could have believed you miss porter least of all why i never did believe it even back in the wilds of your african jungle when you tore the raw meat of your kills with mighty jaws like some wild beast and wiped your greasy hands upon your thighs even then before there was the slightest proof to the contrary i knew that you were mistaken in the belief that kala was your mother and now with your father's diary of the terrible life led by him and your mother on that wild african shore with the account of your birth and final and most convincing proof of all your own baby finger prints upon the pages of it it seems incredible to me that you are willing to remain a nameless penniless vagabond i do not need any better name than tarzan replied the ape man and as for remaining a penniless vagabond i have no intention of so doing in fact the next and let us hope the last burden that i shall be forced to put upon your unselfish friendship will be the finding of employment for me pooh pooh scoffed d'arnot you know that i did not mean that have i not told you a dozen times that i have enough for twenty men and that half of what i have is yours and if i gave it all to you would it represent even the tenth part of the value i place upon your friendship my tarzan would it repay the services you did me in africa i do not forget my friend that but for you and your wondrous bravery i had died at the stake in the village of mbonga's cannibals nor do i forget that to your self sacrificing devotion i owe the fact that i recovered from the terrible wounds i received at their hands i discovered later something of what it meant to you to remain with me in the amphitheater of apes while your heart was urging you on to the coast when we finally came there and found that miss porter and her party had left i commenced to realize something of what you had done for an utter stranger nor am i trying to repay you with money tarzan it is that just at present you need money were it sacrifice that i might offer you it were the same my friendship must always be yours because our tastes are similar and i admire you that i cannot command but the money i can and shall well laughed tarzan we shall not quarrel over the money i must live and so i must have it but i shall be more contented with something to do you cannot show me your friendship in a more convincing manner than to find employment for me i shall die of inactivity in a short while as for my birthright it is in good hands clayton is not guilty of robbing me of it he truly believes that he is the real lord greystoke and the chances are that he will make a better english lord than a man who was born and raised in an african jungle you know that i am but half civilized even now let me see red in anger but for a moment and all the instincts of the savage beast that i really am submerge what little i possess of the milder ways of culture and refinement and then again had i declared myself i should have robbed the woman i love of the wealth and position that her marriage to clayton will now insure to her i could not have done that could i paul nor is the matter of birth of great importance to me he went on without waiting for a reply raised as i have been i see no worth in man or beast that is not theirs by virtue of their own mental or physical prowess and so i am as happy to think of kala as my mother as i would be to try to picture the poor unhappy little english girl who passed away a year after she bore me kala was always kind to me in her fierce and savage way i must have nursed at her hairy breast from the time that my own mother died she fought for me against the wild denizens of the forest and against the savage members of our tribe with the ferocity of real mother love and i on my part loved her paul i did not realize how much until after the cruel spear and the poisoned arrow of mbonga's black warrior had stolen her away from me i was still a child when that occurred and i threw myself upon her dead body and wept out my anguish as a child might for his own mother to you my friend she would have appeared a hideous and ugly creature but to me she was beautiful so gloriously does love transfigure its object and so i am perfectly content to remain forever the son of kala the she ape i do not admire you the less for your loyalty said d'arnot but the time will come when you will be glad to claim your own remember what i say and let us hope that it will be as easy then as it is now you must bear in mind that professor porter and mr philander are the only people in the world who can swear that the little skeleton found in the cabin with those of your father and mother was that of an infant anthropoid ape and not the offspring of lord and lady greystoke that evidence is most important they are both old men they may not live many years longer and then did it not occur to you that once miss porter knew the truth she would break her engagement with clayton you might easily have your title your estates and the woman you love tarzan had you not thought of that tarzan shook his head you do not know her he said nothing could bind her closer to her bargain than some misfortune to clayton she is from an old southern family in america and southerners pride themselves upon their loyalty tarzan spent the two following weeks renewing his former brief acquaintance with paris in the daytime he haunted the libraries and picture galleries he had become an omnivorous reader and the world of possibilities that were opened to him in this seat of culture and learning fairly appalled him when he contemplated the very infinitesimal crumb of the sum total of human knowledge that a single individual might hope to acquire even after a lifetime of study and research but he learned what he could by day and threw himself into a search for relaxation and amusement at night nor did he find paris a whit less fertile field for his nocturnal avocation if he smoked too many cigarettes and drank too much absinth it was because he took civilization as he found it and did the things that he found his civilized brothers doing the life was a new and alluring one and in addition he had a sorrow in his breast and a great longing which he knew could never be fulfilled and so he sought in study and in dissipation the two extremes to forget the past and inhibit contemplation of the future he was sitting in a music hall one evening sipping his absinth and admiring the art of a certain famous russian dancer when he caught a passing glimpse of a pair of evil black eyes upon him the man turned and was lost in the crowd at the exit before tarzan could catch a good look at him but he was confident that he had seen those eyes before and that they had been fastened on him this evening through no passing accident he had had the uncanny feeling for some time that he was being watched and it was in response to this animal instinct that was strong within him that he had turned suddenly and surprised the eyes in the very act of watching him before he left the music hall the matter had been forgotten nor did he notice the swarthy individual who stepped deeper into the shadows of an opposite doorway as tarzan emerged from the brilliantly lighted amusement hall had tarzan but known it he had been followed many times from this and other places of amusement but seldom if ever had he been alone tonight d'arnot had had another engagement and tarzan had come by himself as he turned in the direction he was accustomed to taking from this part of paris to his apartments the watcher across the street ran from his hiding place and hurried on ahead at a rapid pace tarzan had been wont to traverse the rue maule on his way home at night because it was very quiet and very dark it reminded him more of his beloved african jungle than did the noisy and garish streets surrounding it if you are familiar with your paris you will recall the narrow forbidding precincts of the rue maule if you are not you need but ask the police about it to learn that in all paris there is no street to which you should give a wider berth after dark on this night tarzan had proceeded some two squares through the dense shadows of the squalid old tenements which line this dismal way when he was attracted by screams and cries for help from the third floor of an opposite building the voice was a woman's before the echoes of her first cries had died tarzan was bounding up the stairs and through the dark corridors to her rescue at the end of the corridor on the third landing a door stood slightly ajar and from within tarzan heard again the same appeal that had lured him from the street another instant found him in the center of a dimly lighted room an oil lamp burned upon a high old fashioned mantel casting its dim rays over a dozen repulsive figures all but one were men the other was a woman of about thirty her face marked by low passions and dissipation might once have been lovely she stood with one hand at her throat crouching against the farther wall help monsieur she cried in a low voice as tarzan entered the room they were killing me as tarzan turned toward the men about him he saw the crafty evil faces of habitual criminals he wondered that they had made no effort to escape a movement behind him caused him to turn two things his eyes saw and one of them caused him considerable wonderment a man was sneaking stealthily from the room and in the brief glance that tarzan had of him he saw that it was rokoff but the other thing that he saw was of more immediate interest it was a great brute of a fellow tiptoeing upon him from behind with a huge bludgeon in his hand and then as the man and his confederates saw that he was discovered there was a concerted rush upon tarzan from all sides some of the men drew knives others picked up chairs while the fellow with the bludgeon raised it high above his head in a mighty swing that would have crushed tarzan's head had it ever descended upon it but the brain and the agility and the muscles that had coped with the mighty strength and cruel craftiness of terkoz and numa in the fastness of their savage jungle were not to be so easily subdued as these apaches of paris had believed selecting his most formidable antagonist the fellow with the bludgeon tarzan charged full upon him dodging the falling weapon and catching the man a terrific blow on the point of the chin that felled him in his tracks then he turned upon the others this was sport he was reveling in the joy of battle and the lust of blood as though it had been but a brittle shell to break at the least rough usage the thin veneer of his civilization fell from him and the ten burly villains found themselves penned in a small room with a wild and savage beast against whose steel muscles their puny strength was less than futile at the end of the corridor without stood rokoff waiting the outcome of the affair he wished to be sure that tarzan was dead before he left but it was not a part of his plan to be one of those within the room when the murder occurred the woman still stood where she had when tarzan entered but her face had undergone a number of changes with the few minutes which had elapsed from the semblance of distress which it had worn when tarzan first saw it it had changed to one of craftiness as he had wheeled to meet the attack from behind but the change tarzan had not seen later an expression of surprise and then one of horror superseded the others and who may wonder for the immaculate gentleman her cries had lured to what was to have been his death had been suddenly metamorphosed into a demon of revenge instead of soft muscles and a weak resistance she was looking upon a veritable hercules gone mad mon dieu she cried he is a beast for the strong white teeth of the ape man had found the throat of one of his assailants and tarzan fought as he had learned to fight with the great bull apes of the tribe of kerchak he was in a dozen places at once leaping hither and thither about the room in sinuous bounds that reminded the woman of a panther she had seen at the zoo now a wrist bone snapped in his iron grip now a shoulder was wrenched from its socket as he forced a victim's arm backward and upward with shrieks of pain the men escaped into the hallway as quickly as they could but even before the first one staggered bleeding and broken from the room rokoff had seen enough to convince him that tarzan would not be the one to lie dead in that house this night and so the russian had hastened to a nearby den and telephoned the police that a man was committing murder on the third floor of rue maule 27 when the officers arrived they found three men groaning on the floor a frightened woman lying upon a filthy bed her face buried in her arms and what appeared to be a well dressed young gentleman standing in the center of the room awaiting the reenforcements which he had thought the footsteps of the officers hurrying up the stairway had announced but they were mistaken in the last it was a wild beast that looked upon them through those narrowed lids and steel gray eyes with the smell of blood the last vestige of civilization had deserted tarzan and now he stood at bay like a lion surrounded by hunters awaiting the next overt act and crouching to charge its author what has happened here asked one of the policemen tarzan explained briefly but when he turned to the woman for confirmation of his statement he was appalled by her reply he lies she screamed shrilly addressing the policeman he came to my room while i was alone and for no good purpose when i repulsed him he would have killed me had not my screams attracted these gentlemen who were passing the house at the time he is a devil monsieurs alone he has all but killed ten men with his bare hands and his teeth so shocked was tarzan by her ingratitude that for a moment he was struck dumb the police were inclined to be a little skeptical for they had had other dealings with this same lady and her lovely coterie of gentlemen friends however they were policemen not judges so they decided to place all the inmates of the room under arrest and let another whose business it was separate the innocent from the guilty but they found that it was one thing to tell this well dressed young man that he was under arrest but quite another to enforce it i am guilty of no offense he said quietly i have but sought to defend myself i do not know why the woman has told you what she has she can have no enmity against me for never until i came to this room in response to her cries for help had i seen her come come said one of the officers there are judges to listen to all that and he advanced to lay his hand upon tarzan's shoulder an instant later he lay crumpled in a corner of the room and then as his comrades rushed in upon the ape man they experienced a taste of what the apaches had but recently gone through so quickly and so roughly did he handle them that they had not even an opportunity to draw their revolvers during the brief fight tarzan had noted the open window and beyond the stem of a tree or a telegraph pole he could not tell which as the last officer went down one of his fellows succeeded in drawing his revolver and from where he lay on the floor fired at tarzan the shot missed and before the man could fire again tarzan had swept the lamp from the mantel and plunged the room into darkness the next they saw was a lithe form spring to the sill of the open window and leap panther like onto the pole across the walk when the police gathered themselves together and reached the street their prisoner was nowhere to be seen they did not handle the woman and the men who had not escaped any too gently when they took them to the station they were a very sore and humiliated detail of police it galled them to think that it would be necessary to report that a single unarmed man had wiped the floor with the whole lot of them and then escaped them as easily as though they had not existed the officer who had remained in the street swore that no one had leaped from the window or left the building from the time they entered until they had come out his comrades thought that he lied but they could not prove it when tarzan found himself clinging"
