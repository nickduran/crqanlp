shaped panes admitted the sunlight into hall and chamber while nevertheless the second story projecting far over the base and itself retiring beneath the third threw a shadowy and thoughtful gloom into the lower rooms carved globes of wood were affixed under the jutting stories little spiral rods of iron beautified each of the seven peaks on the triangular portion of the gable that fronted next the street was a dial put up that very morning and on which the sun was still marking the passage of the first bright hour in a history that was not destined to be all so bright all around were scattered shavings chips shingles and broken halves of bricks these together with the lately turned earth on which the grass had not begun to grow contributed to the impression of strangeness and novelty proper to a house that had yet its place to make among men's daily interests the principal entrance which had almost the breadth of a church door was in the angle between the two front gables and was covered by an open porch with benches beneath its shelter under this arched doorway scraping their feet on the unworn threshold now trod the clergymen the elders the magistrates the deacons and whatever of aristocracy there was in town or county thither too thronged the plebeian classes as freely as their betters and in larger number just within the entrance however stood two serving men pointing some of the guests to the neighborhood of the kitchen and ushering others into the statelier rooms hospitable alike to all but still with a scrutinizing regard to the high or low degree of each velvet garments sombre but rich stiffly plaited ruffs and bands embroidered gloves venerable beards the mien and countenance of authority made it easy to distinguish the gentleman of worship at that period from the tradesman with his plodding air or the laborer in his leathern jerkin stealing awe stricken into the house which he had perhaps helped to build one inauspicious circumstance there was which awakened a hardly concealed displeasure in the breasts of a few of the more punctilious visitors the founder of this stately mansion a gentleman noted for the square and ponderous courtesy of his demeanor ought surely to have stood in his own hall and to have offered the first welcome to so many eminent personages as here presented themselves in honor of his solemn festival he was as yet invisible the most favored of the guests had not beheld him this sluggishness on colonel pyncheon's part became still more unaccountable when the second dignitary of the province made his appearance and found no more ceremonious a reception the lieutenant governor although his visit was one of the anticipated glories of the day had alighted from his horse and assisted his lady from her side saddle and crossed the colonel's threshold without other greeting than that of the principal domestic this person a gray headed man of quiet and most respectful deportment found it necessary to explain that his master still remained in his study or private apartment on entering which an hour before he had expressed a wish on no account to be disturbed do not you see fellow said the high sheriff of the county taking the servant aside that this is no less a man than the lieutenant governor summon colonel pyncheon at once i know that he received letters from england this morning and in the perusal and consideration of them an hour may have passed away without his noticing it but he will be ill pleased i judge if you suffer him to neglect the courtesy due to one of our chief rulers and who may be said to represent king william in the absence of the governor himself call your master instantly nay please your worship answered the man in much perplexity but with a backwardness that strikingly indicated the hard and severe character of colonel pyncheon's domestic rule my master's orders were exceeding strict and as your worship knows he permits of no discretion in the obedience of those who owe him service let who list open yonder door i dare not though the governor's own voice should bid me do it pooh pooh master high sheriff cried the lieutenant governor who had overheard the foregoing discussion and felt himself high enough in station to play a little with his dignity i will take the matter into my own hands it is time that the good colonel came forth to greet his friends else we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken a sip too much of his canary wine in his extreme deliberation which cask it were best to broach in honor of the day but since he is so much behindhand i will give him a remembrancer myself accordingly with such a tramp of his ponderous riding boots as might of itself have been audible in the remotest of the seven gables he advanced to the door which the servant pointed out and made its new panels reecho with a loud free knock then looking round with a smile to the spectators he awaited a response as none came however he knocked again but with the same unsatisfactory result as at first and now being a trifle choleric in his temperament the lieutenant governor uplifted the heavy hilt of his sword wherewith he so beat and banged upon the door that as some of the bystanders whispered the racket might have disturbed the dead be that as it might it seemed to produce no awakening effect on colonel pyncheon when the sound subsided the silence through the house was deep dreary and oppressive notwithstanding that the tongues of many of the guests had already been loosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine or spirits strange forsooth very strange cried the lieutenant governor whose smile was changed to a frown but seeing that our host sets us the good example of forgetting ceremony i shall likewise throw it aside and make free to intrude on his privacy he tried the door which yielded to his hand and was flung wide open by a sudden gust of wind that passed as with a loud sigh from the outermost portal through all the passages and apartments of the new house it rustled the silken garments of the ladies and waved the long curls of the gentlemen's wigs and shook the window hangings and the curtains of the bedchambers causing everywhere a singular stir which yet was more like a hush a shadow of awe and half fearful anticipation nobody knew wherefore nor of what had all at once fallen over the company they thronged however to the now open door pressing the lieutenant governor in the eagerness of their curiosity into the room in advance of them at the first glimpse they beheld nothing extraordinary a handsomely furnished room of moderate size somewhat darkened by curtains books arranged on shelves a large map on the wall and likewise a portrait of colonel pyncheon beneath which sat the original colonel himself in an oaken elbow chair with a pen in his hand letters parchments and blank sheets of paper were on the table before him he appeared to gaze at the curious crowd in front of which stood the lieutenant governor and there was a frown on his dark and massive countenance as if sternly resentful of the boldness that had impelled them into his private retirement a little boy the colonel's grandchild and the only human being that ever dared to be familiar with him now made his way among the guests and ran towards the seated figure then pausing halfway he began to shriek with terror the company tremulous as the leaves of a tree when all are shaking together drew nearer and perceived that there was an unnatural distortion in the fixedness of colonel pyncheon's stare that there was blood on his ruff and that his hoary beard was saturated with it it was too late to give assistance the iron hearted puritan the relentless persecutor the grasping and strong willed man was dead dead in his new house there is a tradition only worth alluding to as lending a tinge of superstitious awe to a scene perhaps gloomy enough without it that a voice spoke loudly among the guests the tones of which were like those of old matthew maule the executed wizard god hath given him blood to drink thus early had that one guest the only guest who is certain at one time or another to find his way into every human dwelling thus early had death stepped across the threshold of the house of the seven gables colonel pyncheon's sudden and mysterious end made a vast deal of noise in its day there were many rumors some of which have vaguely drifted down to the present time how that appearances indicated violence that there were the marks of fingers on his throat and the print of a bloody hand on his plaited ruff and that his peaked beard was dishevelled as if it had been fiercely clutched and pulled it was averred likewise that the lattice window near the colonel's chair was open and that only a few minutes before the fatal occurrence the figure of a man had been seen clambering over the garden fence in the rear of the house but it were folly to lay any stress on stories of this kind which are sure to spring up around such an event as that now related and which as in the present case sometimes prolong themselves for ages afterwards like the toadstools that indicate where the fallen and buried trunk of a tree has long since mouldered into the earth for our own part we allow them just as little credence as to that other fable of the skeleton hand which the lieutenant governor was said to have seen at the colonel's throat but which vanished away as he advanced farther into the room certain it is however that there was a great consultation and dispute of doctors over the dead body one john swinnerton by name who appears to have been a man of eminence upheld it if we have rightly understood his terms of art to be a case of apoplexy his professional brethren each for himself adopted various hypotheses more or less plausible but all dressed out in a perplexing mystery of phrase which if it do not show a bewilderment of mind in these erudite physicians certainly causes it in the unlearned peruser of their opinions the coroner's jury sat upon the corpse and like sensible men returned an unassailable verdict of sudden death it is indeed difficult to imagine that there could have been a serious suspicion of murder or the slightest grounds for implicating any particular individual as the perpetrator the rank wealth and eminent character of the deceased must have insured the strictest scrutiny into every ambiguous circumstance as none such is on record it is safe to assume that none existed tradition which sometimes brings down truth that history has let slip but is oftener the wild babble of the time such as was formerly spoken at the fireside and now congeals in newspapers tradition is responsible for all contrary averments in colonel pyncheon's funeral sermon which was printed and is still extant the rev mr higginson enumerates among the many felicities of his distinguished parishioner's earthly career the happy seasonableness of his death his duties all performed the highest prosperity attained his race and future generations fixed on a stable basis and with a stately roof to shelter them for centuries to come what other upward step remained for this good man to take save the final step from earth to the golden gate of heaven the pious clergyman surely would not have uttered words like these had he in the least suspected that the colonel had been thrust into the other world with the clutch of violence upon his throat the family of colonel pyncheon at the epoch of his death seemed destined to as fortunate a permanence as can anywise consist with the inherent instability of human affairs it might fairly be anticipated that the progress of time would rather increase and ripen their prosperity than wear away and destroy it for not only had his son and heir come into immediate enjoyment of a rich estate but there was a claim through an indian deed confirmed by a subsequent grant of the general court to a vast and as yet unexplored and unmeasured tract of eastern lands these possessions for as such they might almost certainly be reckoned comprised the greater part of what is now known as waldo county in the state of maine and were more extensive than many a dukedom or even a reigning prince's territory on european soil when the pathless forest that still covered this wild principality should give place as it inevitably must though perhaps not till ages hence to the golden fertility of human culture it would be the source of incalculable wealth to the pyncheon blood had the colonel survived only a few weeks longer it is probable that his great political influence and powerful connections at home and abroad would have consummated all that was necessary to render the claim available but in spite of good mr higginson's congratulatory eloquence this appeared to be the one thing which colonel pyncheon provident and sagacious as he was had allowed to go at loose ends so far as the prospective territory was concerned he unquestionably died too soon his son lacked not merely the father's eminent position but the talent and force of character to achieve it he could therefore effect nothing by dint of political interest and the bare justice or legality of the claim was not so apparent after the colonel's decease as it had been pronounced in his lifetime some connecting link had slipped out of the evidence and could not anywhere be found efforts it is true were made by the pyncheons not only then but at various periods for nearly a hundred years afterwards to obtain what they stubbornly persisted in deeming their right but in course of time the territory was partly regranted to more favored individuals and partly cleared and occupied by actual settlers these last if they ever heard of the pyncheon title would have laughed at the idea of any man's asserting a right on the strength of mouldy parchments signed with the faded autographs of governors and legislators long dead and forgotten to the lands which they or their fathers had wrested from the wild hand of nature by their own sturdy toil this impalpable claim therefore resulted in nothing more solid than to cherish from generation to generation an absurd delusion of family importance which all along characterized the pyncheons it caused the poorest member of the race to feel as if he inherited a kind of nobility and might yet come into the possession of princely wealth to support it in the better specimens of the breed this peculiarity threw an ideal grace over the hard material of human life without stealing away any truly valuable quality in the baser sort its effect was to increase the liability to sluggishness and dependence and induce the victim of a shadowy hope to remit all self effort while awaiting the realization of his dreams years and years after their claim had passed out of the public memory the pyncheons were accustomed to consult the colonel's ancient map which had been projected while waldo county was still an unbroken wilderness where the old land surveyor had put down woods lakes and rivers they marked out the cleared spaces and dotted the villages and towns and calculated the progressively increasing value of the territory as if there were yet a prospect of its ultimately forming a princedom for themselves in almost every generation nevertheless there happened to be some one descendant of the family gifted with a portion of the hard keen sense and practical energy that had so remarkably distinguished the original founder his character indeed might be traced all the way down as distinctly as if the colonel himself a little diluted had been gifted with a sort of intermittent immortality on earth at two or three epochs when the fortunes of the family were low this representative of hereditary qualities had made his appearance and caused the traditionary gossips of the town to whisper among themselves here is the old pyncheon come again now the seven gables will be new shingled from father to son they clung to the ancestral house with singular tenacity of home attachment for various reasons however and from impressions often too vaguely founded to be put on paper the writer cherishes the belief that many if not most of the successive proprietors of this estate were troubled with doubts as to their moral right to hold it of their legal tenure there could be no question but old matthew maule it is to be feared trode downward from his own age to a far later one planting a heavy footstep all the way on the conscience of a pyncheon if so we are left to dispose of the awful query whether each inheritor of the property conscious of wrong and failing to rectify it did not commit anew the great guilt of his ancestor and incur all its original responsibilities and supposing such to be the case would it not be a far truer mode of expression to say of the pyncheon family that they inherited a great misfortune than the reverse we have already hinted that it is not our purpose to trace down the history of the pyncheon family in its unbroken connection with the house of the seven gables nor to show as in a magic picture how the rustiness and infirmity of age gathered over the venerable house itself as regards its interior life a large dim looking glass used to hang in one of the rooms and was fabled to contain within its depths all the shapes that had ever been reflected there the old colonel himself and his many descendants some in the garb of antique babyhood and others in the bloom of feminine beauty or manly prime or saddened with the wrinkles of frosty age had we the secret of that mirror we would gladly sit down before it and transfer its revelations to our page but there was a story for which it is difficult to conceive any foundation that the posterity of matthew maule had some connection with the mystery of the looking glass and that by what appears to have been a sort of mesmeric process they could make its inner region all alive with the departed pyncheons not as they had shown themselves to the world nor in their better and happier hours but as doing over again some deed of sin or in the crisis of life's bitterest sorrow the popular imagination indeed long kept itself busy with the affair of the old puritan pyncheon and the wizard maule the curse which the latter flung from his scaffold was remembered with the very important addition that it had become a part of the pyncheon inheritance if one of the family did but gurgle in his throat a bystander would be likely enough to whisper between jest and earnest he has maule's blood to drink the sudden death of a pyncheon about a hundred years ago with circumstances very similar to what have been related of the colonel's exit was held as giving additional probability to the received opinion on this topic it was considered moreover an ugly and ominous circumstance that colonel pyncheon's picture in obedience it was said to a provision of his will remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died those stern immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil influence and so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the sunshine of the passing hour that no good thoughts or purposes could ever spring up and blossom there to the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of superstition in what we figuratively express by affirming that the ghost of a dead progenitor perhaps as a portion of his own punishment is often doomed to become the evil genius of his family the pyncheons in brief lived along for the better part of two centuries with perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended most other new england families during the same period of time possessing very distinctive traits of their own they nevertheless took the general characteristics of the little community in which they dwelt a town noted for its frugal discreet well ordered and home loving inhabitants as well as for the somewhat confined scope of its sympathies but in which be it said there are odder individuals and now and then stranger occurrences than one meets with almost anywhere else during the revolution the pyncheon of that epoch adopting the royal side became a refugee but repented and made his reappearance just at the point of time to preserve the house of the seven gables from confiscation for the last seventy years the most noted event in the pyncheon annals had been likewise the heaviest calamity that ever befell the race no less than the violent death for so it was adjudged of one member of the family by the criminal act of another certain circumstances attending this fatal occurrence had brought the deed irresistibly home to a nephew of the deceased pyncheon the young man was tried and convicted of the crime but either the circumstantial nature of the evidence and possibly some lurking doubts in the breast of the executive or lastly an argument of greater weight in a republic than it could have been under a monarchy the high respectability and political influence of the criminal's connections had availed to mitigate his doom from death to perpetual imprisonment this sad affair had chanced about thirty years before the action of our story commences latterly there were rumors which few believed and only one or two felt greatly interested in that this long buried man was likely for some reason or other to be summoned forth from his living tomb it is essential to say a few words respecting the victim of this now almost forgotten murder he was an old bachelor and possessed of great wealth in addition to the house and real estate which constituted what remained of the ancient pyncheon property being of an eccentric and melancholy turn of mind and greatly given to rummaging old records and hearkening to old traditions he had brought himself it is averred to the conclusion that matthew maule the wizard had been foully wronged out of his homestead if not out of his life such being the case and he the old bachelor in possession of the ill gotten spoil with the black stain of blood sunken deep into it and still to be scented by conscientious nostrils the question occurred whether it were not imperative upon him even at this late hour to make restitution to maule's posterity to a man living so much in the past and so little in the present as the secluded and antiquarian old bachelor a century and a half seemed not so vast a period as to obviate the propriety of substituting right for wrong it was the belief of those who knew him best that he would positively have taken the very singular step of giving up the house of the seven gables to the representative of matthew maule but for the unspeakable tumult which a suspicion of the old gentleman's project awakened among his pyncheon relatives their exertions had the effect of suspending his purpose but it was feared that he would perform after death by the operation of his last will what he had so hardly been prevented from doing in his proper lifetime but there is no one thing which men so rarely do whatever the provocation or inducement as to bequeath patrimonial property away from their own blood they may love other individuals far better than their relatives they may even cherish dislike or positive hatred to the latter but yet in view of death the strong prejudice of propinquity revives and impels the testator to send down his estate in the line marked out by custom so immemorial that it looks like nature in all the pyncheons this feeling had the energy of disease it was too powerful for the conscientious scruples of the old bachelor at whose death accordingly the mansion house together with most of his other riches passed into the possession of his next legal representative this was a nephew the cousin of the miserable young man who had been convicted of the uncle's murder the new heir up to the period of his accession was reckoned rather a dissipated youth but had at once reformed and made himself an exceedingly respectable member of society in fact he showed more of the pyncheon quality and had won higher eminence in the world than any of his race since the time of the original puritan applying himself in earlier manhood to the study of the law and having a natural tendency towards office he had attained many years ago to a judicial situation in some inferior court which gave him for life the very desirable and imposing title of judge later he had engaged in politics and served a part of two terms in congress besides making a considerable figure in both branches of the state legislature judge pyncheon was unquestionably an honor to his race he had built himself a country seat within a few miles of his native town and there spent such portions of his time as could be spared from public service in the display of every grace and virtue as a newspaper phrased it on the eve of an election befitting the christian the good citizen the horticulturist and the gentleman there were few of the pyncheons left to sun themselves in the glow of the judge's prosperity in respect to natural increase the breed had not thriven it appeared rather to be dying out the only members of the family known to be extant were first the judge himself and a single surviving son who was now travelling in europe next the thirty years prisoner already alluded to and a sister of the latter who occupied in an extremely retired manner the house of the seven gables in which she had a life estate by the will of the old bachelor she was understood to be wretchedly poor and seemed to make it her choice to remain so inasmuch as her affluent cousin the judge had repeatedly offered her all the comforts of life either in the old mansion or his own modern residence the last and youngest pyncheon was a little country girl of seventeen the daughter of another of the judge's cousins who had married a young woman of no family or property and died early and in poor circumstances his widow had recently taken another husband as for matthew maule's posterity it was supposed now to be extinct for a very long period after the witchcraft delusion however the maules had continued to inhabit the town where their progenitor had suffered so unjust a death to all appearance they were a quiet honest well meaning race of people cherishing no malice against individuals or the public for the wrong which had been done them or if at their own fireside they transmitted from father to child any hostile recollection of the wizard's fate and their lost patrimony it was never acted upon nor openly expressed nor would it have been singular had they ceased to remember that the house of the seven gables was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that was rightfully their own there is something so massive stable and almost irresistibly imposing in the exterior presentment of established rank and great possessions that their very existence seems to give them a right to exist at least so excellent a counterfeit of right that few poor and humble men have moral force enough to question it even in their secret minds such is the case now after so many ancient prejudices have been overthrown and it was far more so in ante revolutionary days when the aristocracy could venture to be proud and the low were content to be abased thus the maules at all events kept their resentments within their own breasts they were generally poverty stricken always plebeian and obscure working with unsuccessful diligence at handicrafts laboring on the wharves or following the sea as sailors before the mast living here and there about the town in hired tenements and coming finally to the almshouse as the natural home of their old age at last after creeping as it were for such a length of time along the utmost verge of the opaque puddle of obscurity they had taken that downright plunge which sooner or later is the destiny of all families whether princely or plebeian for thirty years past neither town record nor gravestone nor the directory nor the knowledge or memory of man bore any trace of matthew maule's descendants his blood might possibly exist elsewhere here where its lowly current could be traced so far back it had ceased to keep an onward course so long as any of the race were to be found they"
