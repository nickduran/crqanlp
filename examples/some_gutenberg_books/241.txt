"1" "brows the slave trader jennings on his arrival at new orleans took up his quarters here with his gang of human cattle and the morning after at 10 o'clock they were exhibited for sale first of all came the beautiful marion whose pale countenance and dejected look told how many sad hours she had passed since parting with her mother at natchez there too was a poor woman who had been separated from her husband and another woman whose looks and manners were expressive of deep anguish sat by her side there was uncle jeems with his whiskers off his face shaven clean and the gray hairs plucked out ready to be sold for ten years younger than he was toby was also there with his face shaven and greased ready for inspection the examination commenced and was carried on in such a manner as to shock the feelings of any one not entirely devoid of the milk of human kindness what are you wiping your eyes for inquired a far red faced man with a white hat set on one side of his head and a cigar in his mouth of a woman who sat on one of the benches because i left my man behind oh if i buy you i will furnish you with a better man than you left i've got lots of young bucks on my farm i don't

i specs i'd have to how long did you live with your third master three years sar why that makes you thirty three i thought you told me you were only twenty five aaron now looked first at the planter then at the trader and seemed perfectly bewildered he had forgotten the lesson given him by pompey relative to his age and the planter's circuitous questions doubtless to find out the slave's real age had thrown the negro off his guard i must see you back so as to know how much you have been whipped before i think of buying pompey who had been standing by during the examination thought that his services were now required and stepping forth with a degree of officiousness said to aaron don't you hear de gemman tell you he wants to zamin you cum unharness yo'seff ole boy and don't be standin dar aaron was soon examined and pronounced sound yet the conflicting statement about his age was not satisfactory fortunately for marion she was spared the pain of undergoing such an examination mr cardney a teller in one of the banks had just been married and wanted a maid servant for his wife and passing through the market in the early part of the day was pleased with the young slave's appearance and his dwelling the quadroon found a much better home than often falls to the lot of a slave sold in the new orleans market chapter vii the slave holding parson the rev james wilson was a native of the state of connecticut where he was educated for the ministry in the methodist persuasion his father was a strict follower of john wesley and spared no pains in his son's education with the hope that he would one day be as renowned as the leader of his sect james had scarcely finished his education at new haven when he was invited by an uncle then on a visit to his father to spend a few months at natchez in mississippi young wilson accepted his uncle's invitation and accompanied him to the south few young men and especially clergymen going fresh from college to the south but are looked upon as geniuses in a small way and who are not invited to all the parties in the neighborhood mr wilson was not an exception to this rule the society into which he was thrown on his arrival at natchez was too brilliant for him not to be captivated by it and as might have been expected he succeeded in captivating a plantation with seventy slaves if not the heart of the lady to whom it belonged added to this he became a popular preacher and had a large congregation with a snug salary like other planters mr wilson confided the care of his farm to ned huckelby an overseer of high reputation in his way the poplar farm as it was called was situated in a beautiful valley nine miles from natchez and near the mississippi river the once unshorn face of nature had given way and the farm now blossomed with a splendid harvest the neat cottage stood in a grove where lombardy poplars lift their tops almost to prop the skies where the willow locust and horse chestnut trees spread forth their branches and flowers never ceased to blossom this was the parson's country residence where the family spent only two months during the year his town residence was a fine villa seated on the brow of a hill at the edge of the city it was in the kitchen of this house that agnes found her new home mr wilson was every inch a democrat and early resolved that his people as he called his slaves should be well fed and not over worked and therefore laid down the law and gospel to the overseer as well as to the slaves it is my wish said he to mr carlingham an old school fellow who was spending a few days with him it is my wish that a new system be adopted on the plantations in this state i believe that the sons of ham should have the gospel and i intend that mine shall have it the gospel is calculated to make mankind better and none should be without it what say you said carlingham about the right of man to his liberty now carlingham you have begun to harp again about men's rights i really wish that you could see this matter as i do i regret that i cannot see eye to eye with you said carlingham i am a disciple of rousseau and have for years made the rights of man my study and i must confess to you that i see no difference between white and black as it regards liberty now my dear carlingham would you really have the negroes enjoy the same rights as ourselves i would most certainly look at our great declaration of independence look even at the constitution of our own connecticut and see what is said in these about liberty i regard all this talk about rights as mere humbug the bible is older than the declaration of independence and there i take my stand a long discussion followed in which both gentlemen put forth their peculiar ideas with much warmth of feeling during this conversation there was another person in the room seated by the window who although at work embroidering a fine collar paid minute attention to what was said this was georgiana the only daughter of the parson who had but just returned from connecticut where she had finished her education she had had the opportunity of contrasting the spirit of christianity and liberty in new england with that of slavery in her native state and had learned to feel deeply for the injured negro georgiana was in her nineteenth year and had been much benefited by her residence of five years at the north her form was tall and graceful her features regular and well defined and her complexion was illuminated by the freshness of youth beauty and health the daughter differed from both the father and visitor upon the subject which they had been discussing and as soon as an opportunity offered she gave it as her opinion that the bible was both the bulwark of christianity and of liberty with a smile she said of course papa will overlook my difference with him for although i am a native of the south i am by education and sympathy a northerner mr wilson laughed appearing rather pleased than otherwise at the manner in which his daughter had expressed herself from this georgiana took courage and continued thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself this single passage of scripture should cause us to have respect for the rights of the slave true christian love is of an enlarged and disinterested nature it loves all who love the lord jesus christ in sincerity without regard to color or condition georgiana my dear you are an abolitionist your talk is fanaticism said mr wilson in rather a sharp tone but the subdued look of the girl and the presence of carlingham caused him to soften his language mr wilson having lost his wife by consumption and georgiana being his only child he loved her too dearly to say more even if he felt disposed a silence followed this exhortation from the young christian but her remarks had done a noble work the father's heart was touched and the sceptic for the first time was viewing christianity in its true light chapter viii a night in the parson's kitchen besides agnes whom mr wilson had purchased from the slave trader jennings he kept a number of house servants the chief one of these was sam who must be regarded as second only to the parson himself if a dinner party was in contemplation or any company was to be invited after all the arrangements had been talked over by the minister and his daughter sam was sure to be consulted on the subject by miss georgy as miss wilson was called by all the servants if furniture crockery or anything was to be purchased sam felt that he had been slighted if his opinion was not asked as to the marketing he did it all he sat at the head of the servants table in the kitchen and was master of the ceremonies a single look from him was enough to silence any conversation or noise among the servants in the kitchen or in any other part of the premises there is in the southern states a great amount of prejudice in regard to color even among the negroes themselves the nearer the negro or mulatto approaches to the white the more he seems to feel his superiority over those of a darker hue this is no doubt the result of the prejudice that exists on the part of the whites against both the mulattoes and the blacks sam was originally from kentucky and through the instrumentality of one of his young masters whom he had to take to school he had learned to read so as to be well understood and owing to that fact was considered a prodigy not only among his own master's slaves but also among those of the town who knew him sam had a great wish to follow in the footsteps of his master and be a poet and was therefore often heard singing doggerels of his own composition but there was one drawback to sam and that was his color he was one of the blackest of his race this he evidently regarded as a great misfortune but he endeavored to make up for it in dress mr wilson kept his house servants well dressed and as for sam he was seldom seen except in a ruffled shirt indeed the washerwoman feared him more than any one else in the house agnes had been inaugurated chief of the kitchen department and had a general supervision of the household affairs alfred the coachman peter and hetty made up the remainder of the house servants besides these mr wilson owned eight slaves who were masons these worked in the city being mechanics they were let out to greater advantage than to keep them on the farm every sunday evening mr wilson's servants including the brick layers assembled in the kitchen where the events of the week were fully discussed and commented upon it was on a sunday evening in the month of june that there was a party at mr wilson's house and according to custom in the southern states the ladies had their maid servants with them tea had been served in the house and the servants including the strangers had taken their seats at the table in the kitchen sam being a single gentleman was unusually attentive to the ladies on this occasion he seldom let a day pass without spending an hour or two in combing and brushing his har he had an idea that fresh butter was better for his hair than any other kind of grease and therefore on churning days half a pound of butter had always to be taken out before it was salted when he wished to appear to great advantage he would grease his face to make it shiny therefore on the evening of the party when all the servants were at the table sam cut a big figure there he sat with his wool well combed and buttered face nicely greased and his ruffles extending five or six inches from his bosom the parson in his drawing room did not make a more imposing appearance than did his servant on this occasion i jis bin had my fortune tole last sunday night said sam while helping one of the girls indeed cried half a dozen voices yes continued he aunt winny tole me i's to hab de prettiest yallah gal in de town and dat i's to be free all eyes were immediately turned toward sally johnson who was seated near sam i specs i see somebody blush at dat remark said alfred pass dem pancakes an lasses up dis way mr alf and none ob your sinuwashuns here rejoined sam dat reminds me said agnes dat dorcas simpson is gwine to git married who to i want to know inquired peter to one of mr darby's field hands answered agnes i should tink dat gal wouldn't frow herseff away in dat ar way said sally she's good lookin nough to git a house servant and not hab to put up wid a field nigger yes said sam dat's a werry unsensible remark ob yourn miss sally i admires your judgment werry much i sures you dar's plenty ob susceptible an well dressed house serbants dat a gal ob her looks can git widout takin up wid dem common darkies the evening's entertainment concluded by sam's relating a little of his own experience while with his first master in old kentucky this master was a doctor and had a large practice among his neighbors doctoring both masters and slaves when sam was about fifteen years old his master set him to grinding up ointment and making pills as the young student grew older and became more practised in his profession his services were of more importance to the doctor the physician having a good business and a large number of his patients being slaves the most of whom had to call on the doctor when ill he put sam to bleeding pulling teeth and administering medicine to the slaves sam soon acquired the name among the slaves of the black doctor with this appellation he was delighted and no regular physician could have put on more airs than did the black doctor when his services were required in bleeding he must have more bandages and would rub and smack the arm more than the doctor would have thought of sam was once seen taking out a tooth for one of his patients and nothing appeared more amusing he got the poor fellow down on his back and then getting astride of his chest he applied the turnkeys and pulled away for dear life unfortunately he had got hold of the wrong tooth and the poor man screamed as loud as he could but it was to no purpose for sam had him fast and after a pretty severe tussle out came the sound grinder the young doctor now saw his mistake but consoled himself with the thought that as the wrong tooth was out of the way there was more room to get at the right one bleeding and a dose of calomel were always considered indispensable by the old boss and as a matter of course sam followed in his footsteps on one occasion the old doctor was ill himself so as to be unable to attend to his patients a slave with pass in hand called to receive medical advice and the master told sam to examine him and see what he wanted this delighted him beyond measure for although he had been acting his part in the way of giving out medicine as the master ordered it he had never been called upon by the latter to examine a patient and this seemed to convince him after all that he was no sham doctor as might have been expected he cut a rare figure in his first examination placing himself directly opposite his patient and folding his arms across his breast looking very knowingly he began what's de matter wid you i is sick where is you sick here replied the man putting his hand upon his stomach put out your tongue continued the doctor the man ran out his tongue at full length let me feel your pulse at the same time taking his patient's hand in his and placing his fingers upon his pulse he said ah your case is a bad one ef i don't do something for you and dat pretty quick you'll be a gone coon and dat's sartin at this the man appeared frightened and inquired what was the matter with him in answer to which sam said i done told dat your case is a bad one and dat's enuff on sam's returning to his master's bedside the latter said well sam what do you think is the matter with him his stomach is out ob order sar he replied what do you think had better be done for him i tink i'd better bleed him and gib him a dose ob calomel returned sam so to the latter's gratification the master let him have his own way on one occasion when making pills and ointment sam made a great mistake he got the preparations for both mixed together so that he could not legitimately make either but fearing that if he threw the stuff away his master would flog him and being afraid to inform his superior of the mistake he resolved to make the whole batch of pill and ointment stuff into pills he well knew that the powder over the pills would hide the inside and the fact that most persons shut their eyes when taking such medicine led the young doctor to feel that all would be right in the end therefore sam made his pills boxed them up put on the labels and placed them in a conspicuous position on one of the shelves sam felt a degree of anxiety about his pills however it was a strange mixture and he was not certain whether it would kill or cure but he was willing that it should be tried at last the young doctor had his vanity gratified col tallen one of dr saxondale's patients drove up one morning and sam as usual ran out to the gate to hold the colonel's horse call your master said the colonel i will not get out the doctor was soon beside the carriage and inquired about the health of his patient after a little consultation the doctor returned to his office took down a box of sam's new pills and returned to the carriage take two of these every morning and night said the doctor and if you don't feel relieved double the dose good gracious exclaimed sam in an undertone when he heard his master tell the colonel how to take the pills it was several days before sam could learn the result of his new medicine one afternoon about a fortnight after the colonel's visit sam saw his master's patient riding up to the gate on horseback the doctor happened to be in the yard and met the colonel and said how are you now i am entirely recovered replied the patient those pills of yours put me on my feet the next day i knew they would rejoined the doctor sam was near enough to hear the conversation and was delighted beyond description the negro immediately ran into the kitchen amongst his companions and commenced dancing what de matter wid you inquired the cook i is de greatest doctor in his country replied sam ef you ever get sick call on me no matter what ails you i is de man dat can cure you in no time if you do hab de backache de rheumatics de headache de coller morbus fits er any ting else sam is de gentleman dat can put you on your feet wid his pills for a long time after sam did little else than boast of his skill as a doctor we have said that the black doctor was full of wit and good sense indeed in that respect he had scarcely an equal in the neighborhood although his master resided some little distance out of the city sam was always the first man in all the negro balls and parties in town when his master could give him a pass he went and when he did not give him one he would steal away after his master had retired and run the risk of being taken up by the night watch of course the master never knew anything of the absence of the servant at night without permission as the negroes at these parties tried to excel each other in the way of dress sam was often at a loss to make that appearance that his heart desired but his ready wit ever helped him in this when his master had retired to bed at night it was the duty of sam to put out the lights and take out with him his master's clothes and boots and leave them in the office until morning and then black the boots brush the clothes and return them to his master's room having resolved to attend a dress ball one night without his master's permission and being perplexed for suitable garments sam determined to take his master's so dressing himself in the doctor's clothes even to his boots and hat off the negro started for the city being well acquainted with the usual walk of the patrols he found no difficulty in keeping out of their way as might have been expected sam was the great gun with the ladies that night the next morning sam was back home long before his master's time for rising and the clothes were put in their accustomed place for a long time sam had no difficulty in attiring himself for parties but the old proverb that it is a long lane that has no turning was verified in the negro's case one stormy night when the rain was descending in torrents the doctor heard a rap at his door it was customary with him when called up at night to visit a patient to ring for sam but this time the servant was nowhere to be found the doctor struck a light and looked for clothes they too were gone it was twelve o'clock and the doctor's clothes hat boots and even his watch were nowhere to be found here was a pretty dilemma for a doctor to be in it was some time before the physician could fit himself out so as to make the visit at last however he started with one of the farm horses for sam had taken the doctor's best saddle horse the doctor felt sure that the negro had robbed him and was on his way to canada but in this he was mistaken sam had gone to the city to attend a ball and had decked himself out in his master's best suit the physician returned before morning and again retired to bed but with little hope of sleep for his thoughts were with his servant and horse at six o'clock in walked sam with his master's clothes and the boots neatly blacked the watch was placed on the shelf and the hat in its place sam had not met any of the servants and was therefore entirely ignorant of what had occurred during his absence what have you been about sir and where was you last night when i was called asked the doctor i don't know sir i spose i was asleep replied sam but the doctor was not to be so easily satisfied after having been put to so much trouble in hunting up another suit without the aid of sam after breakfast sam was taken into the barn tied up and severely flogged with the cat which brought from him the truth concerning his absence the previous night this forever put an end to his fine appearance at the negro parties had not the doctor been one of the most indulgent of masters he would not have escaped with merely a severe whipping as a matter of course sam had to relate to his companions that evening in mr wilson's kitchen all his adventures as a physician while with his old master chapter ix the man of honor augustine cardinay the purchaser of marion was from the green mountains of vermont and his feelings were opposed to the holding of slaves but his young wife persuaded him into the idea that it was no worse to own a slave than to hire one and pay the money to another hence it was that he had been induced to purchase marion adolphus morton a young physician from the same state and who had just commenced the practice of his profession in new orleans was boarding with cardinay when marion was brought home the young physician had been in new orleans but a very few weeks and had seen but little of slavery in his own mountain home he had been taught that the slaves of the southern states were negroes and if not from the coast of africa the descendants of those who had been imported he was unprepared to behold with composure a beautiful white girl of sixteen in the degraded position of a chattel slave the blood chilled in his young heart as he heard cardinay tell how by bantering with the trader he had bought her two hundred dollars less than he first asked his very looks showed that she had the deepest sympathies of his heart marion had been brought up by her mother to look after the domestic concerns of her cottage in virginia and well knew how to perform the duties imposed upon her mrs cardinay was much pleased with her new servant and often mentioned her good qualities in the presence of mr morton after eight months acquaintance with marion morton's sympathies ripened into love which was most cordially reciprocated by the friendless and injured child of sorrow there was but one course which the young man could honorably pursue and that was to purchase marion and make her his lawful wife and this he did immediately for he found mr and mrs cardinay willing to second his liberal intentions the young man after purchasing marion from cardinay and marrying her took lodgings in another part of the city a private teacher was called in and the young wife was taught some of those accomplishments so necessary for one taking a high position in good society dr morton soon obtained a large and influential practice in his profession and with it increased in wealth but with all his wealth he never owned a slave probably the fact that he had raised his wife from that condition kept the hydra headed system continually before him to the credit of marion be it said she used every means to obtain the freedom of her mother who had been sold to parson wilson at natchez her efforts however had come too late for agnes had died of a fever before the arrival of dr morton's agent marion found in adolphus morton a kind and affectionate husband and his wish to purchase her mother although unsuccessful had doubly endeared him"
