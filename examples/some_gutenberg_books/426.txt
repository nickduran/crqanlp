"1" "me swear to tell you but for my part he cried bursting into tears i just wish that i was dead and he fell on his knees before a chair and hid his face whether his father spoke or whether he remained long in the room or at once departed are points lost to history a horrid turmoil of mind and body bursting sobs broken vanishing thoughts now of indignation now of remorse broken elementary whiffs of consciousness of the smell of the horse hair on the chair bottom of the jangling of church bells that now began to make day horrible throughout the confines of the city of the hard floor that bruised his knees of the taste of tears that found their way into his mouth for a period of time the duration of which i cannot guess while i refuse to dwell longer on its agony these were the whole of god’s world for john nicholson when at last as by the touching of a spring he returned again to clearness of consciousness and even a measure of composure the bells had but just done ringing and the sabbath silence was still marred by the patter of belated feet by the clock above the fire as well as by these more speaking signs the service had not long begun and the unhappy sinner if his father had really gone to church might count on near two hours of only comparative unhappiness with his father the superlative degree returned infallibly he knew it by every shrinking fibre in his body he knew it by the sudden dizzy whirling of his brain at the mere thought of that calamity an hour and a half perhaps an hour and three quarters if the doctor was long winded and then would begin again that active agony from which even in the dull ache of the present he shrunk as from the bite of fire he saw in a vision the family pew the somnolent cushions the bibles the psalm books maria with her smelling salts his father sitting spectacled and critical and at once he was struck with indignation not unjustly it was inhuman to go off to church and leave a sinner in suspense unpunished unforgiven and at the very touch of criticism the paternal sanctity was lessened yet the paternal terror only grew and the two strands of feeling pushed him in the same direction and suddenly there came upon him a mad fear lest his father should have locked him in the notion had no ground in sense it was probably no more than a reminiscence of similar calamities in childhood for his father’s room had always been the chamber of inquisition and the scene of punishment but it stuck so rigorously in his mind that he must instantly approach the door and prove its untruth as he went he struck upon a drawer left open in the business table it was the money drawer a measure of his father’s disarray the money drawer perhaps a pointing providence who is to decide when even divines differ between a providence and a temptation or who sitting calmly under his own vine is to pass a judgment on the doings of a poor hunted dog slavishly afraid slavishly rebellious like john nicholson on that particular sunday his hand was in the drawer almost before his mind had conceived the hope and rising to his new situation he wrote sitting in his father’s chair and using his father’s blotting pad his pitiful apology and farewell my dear father i have taken the money but i will pay it back as soon as i am able you will never hear of me again i did not mean any harm by anything so i hope you will try and forgive me i wish you would say good bye to alexander and maria but not if you don’t want to i could not wait to see you really please try to forgive me your affectionate son john nicholson the coins abstracted and the missive written he could not be gone too soon from the scene of these transgressions and remembering how his father had once returned from church on some slight illness in the middle of the second psalm he durst not even make a packet of a change of clothes attired as he was he slipped from the paternal doors and found himself in the cool spring air the thin spring sunshine and the great sabbath quiet of the city which was now only pointed by the cawing of the rooks there was not a soul in randolph crescent nor a soul in queensferry street in this outdoor privacy and the sense of escape john took heart again and with a pathetic sense of leave taking he even ventured up the lane and stood awhile a strange peri at the gates of a quaint paradise by the west end of st george’s church they were singing within and by a strange chance the tune was st george’s edinburgh which bears the name and was first sung in the choir of that church who is this king of glory went the voices from within and to john this was like the end of all christian observances for he was now to be a wild man like ishmael and his life was to be cast in homeless places and with godless people it was thus with no rising sense of the adventurous but in mere desolation and despair that he turned his back on his native city and set out on foot for california with a more immediate eye to glasgow chapter iv the second sowing it is no part of mine to narrate the adventures of john nicholson which were many but simply his more momentous misadventures which were more than he desired and by human standards more than he deserved how he reached california how he was rooked and robbed and beaten and starved how he was at last taken up by charitable folk restored to some degree of self complacency and installed as a clerk in a bank in san francisco it would take too long to tell nor in these episodes were there any marks of the peculiar nicholsonic destiny for they were just such matters as befell some thousands of other young adventurers in the same days and places but once posted in the bank he fell for a time into a high degree of good fortune which as it was only a longer way about to fresh disaster it behooves me to explain it was his luck to meet a young man in what is technically called a dive and thanks to his monthly wages to extricate this new acquaintance from a position of present disgrace and possible danger in the future this young man was the nephew of one of the nob hill magnates who run the san francisco stock exchange much as more humble adventurers in the corner of some public park at home may be seen to perform the simple artifice of pea and thimble for their own profit that is to say and the discouragement of public gambling it was thus in his power and as he was of grateful temper it was among the things that he desired to put john in the way of growing rich and thus without thought or industry or so much as even understanding the game at which he played but by simply buying and selling what he was told to buy and sell that plaything of fortune was presently at the head of between eleven and twelve thousand pounds or as he reckoned it of upward of sixty thousand dollars how he had come to deserve this wealth any more than how he had formerly earned disgrace at home was a problem beyond the reach of his philosophy it was true that he had been industrious at the bank but no more so than the cashier who had seven small children and was visibly sinking in decline nor was the step which had determined his advance a visit to a dive with a month’s wages in his pocket an act of such transcendent virtue or even wisdom as to seem to merit the favour of the gods from some sense of this and of the dizzy see saw heaven high hell deep on which men sit clutching or perhaps fearing that the sources of his fortune might be insidiously traced to some root in the field of petty cash he stuck to his work said not a word of his new circumstances and kept his account with a bank in a different quarter of the town the concealment innocent as it seems was the first step in the second tragicomedy of john’s existence meanwhile he had never written home whether from diffidence or shame or a touch of anger or mere procrastination or because as we have seen he had no skill in literary arts or because as i am sometimes tempted to suppose there is a law in human nature that prevents young men not otherwise beasts from the performance of this simple act of piety months and years had gone by and john had never written the habit of not writing indeed was already fixed before he had begun to come into his fortune and it was only the difficulty of breaking this long silence that withheld him from an instant restitution of the money he had stolen or as he preferred to call it borrowed in vain he sat before paper attending on inspiration that heavenly nymph beyond suggesting the words my dear father remained obstinately silent and presently john would crumple up the sheet and decide as soon as he had a good chance to carry the money home in person and this delay which is indefensible was his second step into the snares of fortune ten years had passed and john was drawing near to thirty he had kept the promise of his boyhood and was now of a lusty frame verging toward corpulence good features good eyes a genial manner a ready laugh a long pair of sandy whiskers a dash of an american accent a close familiarity with the great american joke and a certain likeness to a r y l p rs n ge who shall remain nameless for me made up the man’s externals as he could be viewed in society inwardly in spite of his gross body and highly masculine whiskers he was more like a maiden lady than a man of twenty nine it chanced one day as he was strolling down market street on the eve of his fortnight’s holiday that his eye was caught by certain railway bills and in very idleness of mind he calculated that he might be home for christmas if he started on the morrow the fancy thrilled him with desire and in one moment he decided he would go there was much to be done his portmanteau to be packed a credit to be got from the bank where he was a wealthy customer and certain offices to be transacted for that other bank in which he was an humble clerk and it chanced in conformity with human nature that out of all this business it was the last that came to be neglected night found him not only equipped with money of his own but once more as on that former occasion saddled with a considerable sum of other people’s now it chanced there lived in the same boarding house a fellow clerk of his an honest fellow with what is called a weakness for drink though it might in this case have been called a strength for the victim had been drunk for weeks together without the briefest intermission to this unfortunate john intrusted a letter with an inclosure of bonds addressed to the bank manager even as he did so he thought he perceived a certain haziness of eye and speech in his trustee but he was too hopeful to be stayed silenced the voice of warning in his bosom and with one and the same gesture committed the money to the clerk and himself into the hands of destiny i dwell even at the risk of tedium on john’s minutest errors his case being so perplexing to the moralist but we have done with them now the roll is closed the reader has the worst of our poor hero and i leave him to judge for himself whether he or john has been the less deserving henceforth we have to follow the spectacle of a man who was a mere whip top for calamity on whose unmerited misadventures not even the humourist can look without pity and not even the philosopher without alarm that same night the clerk entered upon a bout of drunkenness so consistent as to surprise even his intimate acquaintance he was speedily ejected from the boarding house deposited his portmanteau with a perfect stranger who did not even catch his name wandered he knew not where and was at last hove to all standing in a hospital at sacramento there under the impenetrable _alias_ of the number of his bed the crapulous being lay for some more days unconscious of all things and of one thing in particular that the police were after him two months had come and gone before the convalescent in the sacramento hospital was identified with kirkman the absconding san francisco clerk even then there must elapse nearly a fortnight more till the perfect stranger could be hunted up the portmanteau recovered and john’s letter carried at length to its destination the seal still unbroken the inclosure still intact meanwhile john had gone upon his holidays without a word which was irregular and there had disappeared with him a certain sum of money which was out of all bounds of palliation but he was known to be careless and believed to be honest the manager besides had a regard for him and little was said although something was no doubt thought until the fortnight was finally at an end and the time had come for john to reappear then indeed the affair began to look black and when inquiries were made and the penniless clerk was found to have amassed thousands of dollars and kept them secretly in a rival establishment the stoutest of his friends abandoned him the books were overhauled for traces of ancient and artful fraud and though none were found there still prevailed a general impression of loss the telegraph was set in motion and the correspondent of the bank in edinburgh for which place it was understood that john had armed himself with extensive credits was warned to communicate with the police now this correspondent was a friend of mr nicholson’s he was well acquainted with the tale of john’s calamitous disappearance from edinburgh and putting one thing with another hasted with the first word of this scandal not to the police but to his friend the old gentleman had long regarded his son as one dead john’s place had been taken the memory of his faults had already fallen to be one of those old aches which awaken again indeed upon occasion but which we can always vanquish by an effort of the will and to have the long lost resuscitated in a fresh disgrace was doubly bitter macewen said the old man this must be hushed up if possible if i give you a cheek for this sum about which they are certain could you take it on yourself to let the matter rest i will said macewen i will take the risk of it you understand resumed mr nicholson speaking precisely but with ashen lips i do this for my family not for that unhappy young man if it should turn out that these suspicions are correct and he has embezzled large sums he must lie on his bed as he has made it and then looking up at macewen with a nod and one of his strange smiles good bye said he and macewen perceiving the case to be too grave for consolation took himself off and blessed god on his way home that he was childless chapter v the prodigal’s return by a little after noon on the eve of christmas john had left his portmanteau in the cloak room and stepped forth into princes street with a wonderful expansion of the soul such as men enjoy on the completion of long nourished schemes he was at home again incognito and rich presently he could enter his father’s house by means of the pass key which he had piously preserved through all his wanderings he would throw down the borrowed money there would be a reconciliation the details of which he frequently arranged and he saw himself during the next month made welcome in many stately houses at many frigid dinner parties taking his share in the conversation with the freedom of the man and the traveller and laying down the law upon finance with the authority of the successful investor but this programme was not to be begun before evening not till just before dinner indeed at which meal the reassembled family were to sit roseate and the best wine the modern fatted calf should flow for the prodigal’s return meanwhile he walked familiar streets merry reminiscences crowding round him sad ones also both with the same surprising pathos the keen frosty air the low rosy wintry sun the castle hailing him like an old acquaintance the names of friends on door plates the sight of friends whom he seemed to recognise and whom he eagerly avoided in the streets the pleasant chant of the north country accent the dome of st george’s reminding him of his last penitential moments in the lane and of that king of glory whose name had echoed ever since in the saddest corner of his memory and the gutters where he had learned to slide and the shop where he had bought his skates and the stones on which he had trod and the railings in which he had rattled his clachan as he went to school and all those thousand and one nameless particulars which the eye sees without noting which the memory keeps indeed yet without knowing and which taken one with another build up for us the aspect of the place that we call home all these besieged him as he went with both delight and sadness his first visit was for houston who had a house on regent terrace kept for him in old days by an aunt the door was opened to his surprise upon the chain and a voice asked him from within what he wanted i want mr houston mr alan houston said he and who are ye said the voice this is most extraordinary thought john and then aloud he told his name no young mr john cried the voice with a sudden increase of scotch accent testifying to a friendlier feeling the very same said john and the old butler removed his defences remarking only i thocht ye were that man but his master was not there he was staying it appeared at the house in murrayfield and though the butler would have been glad enough to have taken his place and given all the news of the family john struck with a little chill was eager to be gone only the door was scarce closed again before he regretted that he had not asked about that man he was to pay no more visits till he had seen his father and made all well at home alan had been the only possible exception and john had not time to go as far as murrayfield but here he was on regent terrace there was nothing to prevent him going round the end of the hill and looking from without on the mackenzies house as he went he reflected that flora must now be a woman of near his own age and it was within the bounds of possibility that she was married but this dishonourable doubt he dammed down there was the house sure enough but the door was of another colour and what was this two door plates he drew nearer the top one bore with dignified simplicity the words mr proudfoot the lower one was more explicit and informed the passer by that here was likewise the abode of mr j a dunlop proudfoot advocate the proudfoots must be rich for no advocate could look to have much business in so remote a quarter and john hated them for their wealth and for their name and for the sake of the house they desecrated with their presence he remembered a proudfoot he had seen at school not known a little whey faced urchin the despicable member of some lower class could it be this abortion that had climbed to be an advocate and now lived in the birthplace of flora and the home of john’s tenderest memories the chill that had first seized upon him when he heard of houston’s absence deepened and struck inward for a moment as he stood under the doors of that estranged house and looked east and west along the solitary pavement of the royal terrace where not a cat was stirring the sense of solitude and desolation took him by the throat and he wished himself in san francisco and then the figure he made with his decent portliness his whiskers the money in his purse the excellent cigar that he now lighted recurred to his mind in consolatory comparison with that of a certain maddened lad who on a certain spring sunday ten years before and in the hour of church time silence had stolen from that city by the glasgow road in the face of these changes it were impious to doubt fortune’s kindness all would be well yet the mackenzies would be found flora younger and lovelier and kinder than before alan would be found and would have so nicely discriminated his behaviour as to have grown on the one hand into a valued friend of mr nicholson’s and to have remained upon the other of that exact shade of joviality which john desired in his companions and so once more john fell to work discounting the delightful future his first appearance in the family pew his first visit to his uncle greig who thought himself so great a financier and on whose purblind edinburgh eyes john was to let in the dazzling daylight of the west and the details in general of that unrivalled transformation scene in which he was to display to all edinburgh a portly and successful gentleman in the shoes of the derided fugitive the time began to draw near when his father would have returned from the office and it would be the prodigal’s cue to enter he strolled westward by albany street facing the sunset embers pleased he knew not why to move in that cold air and indigo twilight starred with street lamps but there was one more disenchantment waiting him by the way at the corner of pitt street he paused to light a fresh cigar the vesta threw as he did so a strong light upon his features and a man of about his own age stopped at sight of it i think your name must be nicholson said the stranger it was too late to avoid recognition and besides as john was now actually on the way home it hardly mattered and he gave way to the impulse of his nature great scott he cried beatson and shook hands with warmth it scarce seemed he was repaid in kind so you’re home again said beatson where have you been all this long time in the states said john california i’ve made my pile though and it suddenly struck me it would be a noble scheme to come home for christmas i see said beatson well i hope we’ll see something of you now you’re here oh i guess so said john a little frozen well ta ta concluded beatson and he shook hands again and went this was a cruel first experience it was idle to blink facts here was john home again and beatson old beatson did not care a rush he recalled old beatson in the past that merry and affectionate lad and their joint adventures and mishaps the window they had broken with a catapult in india place the escalade of the castle rock and many another inestimable bond of friendship and his hurt surprise grew deeper well after all it was only on a man’s own family that he could count blood was thicker than water he remembered and the net result of this encounter was to bring him to the doorstep of his father’s house with tenderer and softer feelings the night had come the fanlight over the door shone bright the two windows of the dining room where the cloth was being laid and the three windows of the drawing room where maria would be waiting dinner glowed softlier through yellow blinds it was like a vision of the past all this time of his absence life had gone forward with an equal foot and the fires and the gas had been lighted and the meals spread at the accustomed hours at the accustomed hour too the bell had sounded thrice to call the family to worship and at the thought a pang of regret for his demerit seized him he remembered the things that were good and that he had neglected and the things that were evil and that he had loved and it was with a prayer upon his lips that he mounted the steps and thrust the key into the key hole he stepped into the lighted hall shut the door softly behind him and stood there fixed in wonder no surprise of strangeness could equal the surprise of that complete familiarity there was the bust of chalmers near the stair railings there was the clothes brush in the accustomed place and there on the hat stand hung hats and coats that must surely be the same as he remembered ten years dropped from his life as a pin may slip between the fingers and the ocean and the mountains and the mines and crowded marts and mingled races of san francisco and his own fortune and his own disgrace became for that one moment the figures of a dream that was over he took off his hat and moved mechanically toward the stand and there he found a small change that was a great one to him the pin that had been his from boyhood where he had flung his balmoral when he loitered home from the academy and his first hat when he came briskly back from college or the office his pin was occupied they might have at least respected my pin he thought and he was moved as by a slight and began at once to recollect that he was here an interloper in a strange house which he had entered almost by a burglary and where at any moment he might be scandalously challenged he moved at once his hat still in his hand to the door of his father’s room opened it and entered mr nicholson sat in the same place and posture as on that last sunday morning only he was older and greyer and sterner and as he now glanced up and caught the eye of his son a strange commotion and a dark flush sprung into his face father said john steadily and even cheerfully for this was a moment against which he was long ago prepared father here i am and here is the money that i took from you i have come back to ask your forgiveness and to stay christmas with you and the children keep your money said the father and go father cried john for god’s sake don’t receive me this way i’ve come for understand me interrupted mr nicholson you are no son of mine and in the sight of god i wash my hands of you one last thing i will tell you one warning i will give you all is discovered and you are being hunted for your crimes if you are still at large it is thanks to me but i have done all that i mean to do and from this time forth i would not raise one finger not one finger to save you from the gallows and now with a low voice of absolute authority and a single weighty gesture of the finger and now go chapter vi the house at murrayfield how john passed the evening in what windy confusion of mind in what squalls of anger and lulls of sick collapse in what pacing of streets and plunging into public houses it would profit little to relate his misery if it were not progressive yet tended in no way to diminish for in proportion as grief and indignation abated fear began to take their place at first his father’s menacing words lay by in some safe drawer of memory biding their hour at first john was all thwarted affection and blighted hope next bludgeoned vanity raised its head again with twenty mortal gashes and the father was disowned even as he had disowned the son what was this regular course of life that john should have admired it what were these clock work virtues from which love was absent kindness was the test kindness the aim and soul and judged by such a standard the discarded prodigal now rapidly drowning his sorrows and his reason in successive drams was a"
