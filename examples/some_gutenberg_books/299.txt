"1" "behind his back the transitions from the light and ethereal texture of melody to the simple more concrete theme which he rendered with delicate shadings of articulation were sufficiently startling to impress even a less cultivated ear than that of edith van kirk who had indeed exhausted whatever musical resources new york has to offer and she was most profoundly impressed as he glided over the last pianissimo notes toward the two concluding chords an ending so characteristic of chopin she rose and hurried to his side with a heedless eagerness which was more eloquent than emphatic words of praise won't you please repeat this passage she said humming the air with soft modulations i have always regarded the monotonous repetition of this strain and she indicated it lightly by a few touches of the keys as rather a blemish of an otherwise perfect composition but as you play it it is anything but monotonous you put into this single phrase a more intense meaning and a greater variety of thought than i ever suspected it was capable of expressing it is my favorite composition answered he modestly i have bestowed more thought upon it than upon anything i have ever played unless perhaps it be the one in g minor which with all its difference of mood and phraseology expresses an essentially kindred thought my dear mr birch exclaimed mrs van kirk whom his skillful employment of technical terms in spite of his indifferent accent had impressed even more than his rendering of the music you are a comsummate sic artist and we shall deem it a great privilege if you will undertake to instruct our child i have listened to you with profound satisfaction halfdan acknowledged the compliment by a bow and a blush and repeated the latter part of the nocturne according to edith's request and now resumed edith may i trouble you to play the g minor which has even puzzled me more than the one you have just played it ought really to have been played first replied halfdan it is far intenser in its coloring and has a more passionate ring but its conclusion does not seem to be final there is no rest in it and it seems oddly enough to be a mere transition into the major which is its proper supplement and completes the fragmentary thought mother and daughter once more telegraphed wondering looks at each other while halfdan plunged into the impetuous movements of the minor nocturne which he played to the end with ever increasing fervor and animation mr birch said edith as he arose from the piano with a flushed face and the agitation of the music still tingling through his nerves you are a far greater musician than you seem to be aware of i have not been taking lessons for some time but you have aroused all my musical ambition and if you will accept me too as a pupil i shall deem it a favor i hardly know if i can teach you anything answered he while his eyes dwelt with keen delight on her beautiful form but in my present position i can hardly afford to decline so flattering an offer you mean to say that you would decline it if you were in a position to do so said she smiling no only that i should question my convenience more closely ah never mind i take all the responsibility i shall cheerfully consent to being imposed upon by you mrs van kirk in the mean while had been examining the contents of a fragrant russia leather pocket book and she now drew out two crisp ten dollar notes and held them out toward him i prefer to make sure of you by paying you in advance said she with a cheerfully familiar nod and a critical glance at his attire the meaning of which he did not fail to detect somebody else might make the same discovery that we have made to day and outbid us and we do not want to be cheated out of our good fortune in having been the first to secure so valuable a prize you need have no fear on that score madam retorted halfdan with a vivid blush and purposely misinterpreting the polite subterfuge you may rely upon my promise i shall be here again as soon as you wish me to return then if you please we shall look for you to morrow morning at ten o'clock and mrs van kirk hesitatingly folded up her notes and replaced them in her pocket book to our idealist there was something extremely odious in this sudden offer of money it was the first time any one had offered to pay him and it seemed to put him on a level with a common day laborer his first impulse was to resent it as a gratuitous humiliation but a glance at mrs van kirk's countenance which was all aglow with officious benevolence re assured him and his indignation died away that same afternoon olson having been informed of his friend's good fortune volunteered a loan of a hundred dollars and accompanied him to a fashionable tailor where he underwent a pleasing metamorphosis v in norway the ladies dress with the innocent purpose of protecting themselves against the weather if this purpose is still remotely present in the toilets of american women of to day it is at all events sufficiently disguised to challenge detection very much like a primitive sanscrit root in its french and english derivatives this was the reflection which was uppermost in halfdan's mind as edith ravishing to behold in the airy grace of her fragrant morning toilet at the appointed time took her seat at his side before the piano her presence seemed so intense so all absorbing that it left no thought for the music a woman with all the spiritual mysteries which that name implies had always appeared to him rather a composite phenomenon even apart from those varied accessories of dress in which as by an inevitable analogy she sees fit to express the inner multiformity of her being nevertheless this former conception of his when compared to that wonderful complexity of ethereal lines colors tints and half tints which go to make up the modern new york girl seemed inexpressibly simple almost what plain arithmetic must appear to a man who has mastered calculus edith had opened one of those small red covered volumes of chopin where the rich wondrous melodies lie peacefully folded up like strange exotic flowers in an herbarium she began to play the fantasia impromtu which ought to be dashed off at a single heat whose passionate impulse hurries it on breathlessly toward its abrupt finale but edith toiled considerably with her fingering and blurred the keen edges of each swift phrase by her indistinct articulation and still there was a sufficiently ardent intention in her play to save it from being a failure she made a gesture of disgust when she had finished shut the book and let her hands drop crosswise in her lap i only wanted to give you a proof of my incapacity she said turning her large luminous gaze upon her instructor in order to make you duly appreciate what you have undertaken now tell me truly and honestly are you not discouraged not by any means replied he while the rapture of her presence rippled through his nerves you have fire enough in you to make an admirable musician but your fingers as yet refuse to carry out your fine intentions they only need discipline and do you suppose you can discipline them they are a fearfully obstinate set and cause me infinite mortification would you allow me to look at your hand she raised her right hand and with a sort of impulsive heedlessness let it drop into his an exclamation of surprise escaped him if you will pardon me he said it is a superb hand a hand capable of performing miracles musical miracles i mean only look here and he drew the fore and second fingers apart so firmly set in the joint and still so flexible i doubt if liszt himself can boast a finer row of fingers your hands will surely not prevent you from becoming a second von bulow which to my mind means a good deal more than a second liszt thank you that is quite enough she exclaimed with an incredulous laugh you have done bravely that at all events throws the whole burden of responsibility upon myself if i do not become a second somebody i shall be perfectly satisfied however if you can only make me as good a musician as you are yourself so that i can render a not too difficult piece without feeling all the while that i am committing sacrilege in mutilating the fine thoughts of some great composer you are too modest you do not no no i am not modest she interrupted him with an impetuosity which startled him i beg of you not to persist in paying me compliments i get too much of that cheap article elsewhere i hate to be told that i am better than i know i am if you are to do me any good by your instruction you must be perfectly sincere toward me and tell me plainly of my short comings i promise you beforehand that i shall never be offended there is my hand now is it a bargain his fingers closed involuntarily over the soft beautiful hand and once more the luxury of her touch sent a thrill of delight through him i have not been insincere he murmured but i shall be on my guard in future even against the appearance of insincerity and when i play detestably you will say so and not smooth it over with unmeaning flatteries i will try very well then we shall get on well together do not imagine that this is a mere feminine whim of mine i never was more in earnest men and i believe foreigners to a greater degree than americans have the idea that women must be treated with gentle forbearance that their follies if they are foolish must be glossed over with some polite name they exert themselves to the utmost to make us mere playthings and as such contemptible both in our own eyes and in theirs no sincere respect can exist where the truth has to be avoided but the majority of american women are made of too stern a stuff to be dealt with in that way they feel the lurking insincerity even where politeness forbids them to show it and it makes them disgusted both with themselves and with the flatterer and now you must pardon me for having spoken so plainly to you on so short an acquaintance but you are a foreigner and it may be an act of friendship to initiate you as soon as possible into our ways and customs he hardly knew what to answer her vehemence was so sudden and the sentiments she had uttered so different from those which he had habitually ascribed to women that he could only sit and gaze at her in mute astonishment he could not but admit that in the main she had judged him rightly and that his own attitude and that of other men toward her sex were based upon an implied assumption of superiority i am afraid i have shocked you she resumed noticing the startled expression of his countenance but really it was quite inevitable if we were at all to understand each other you will forgive me won't you forgive stammered he i have nothing to forgive it was only your merciless truthfulness which startled me i rather owe you thanks if you will allow me to be grateful to you it seems an enviable privilege now interrupted edith raising her forefinger in playful threat remember your promise the lesson was now continued without further interruption when it was finished a little girl with her hair done up in curl papers and a very stiffly starched dress which stood out on all sides almost horizontally entered accompanied by mrs van kirk halfdan immediately recognized his acquaintance from the park and it appeared to him a good omen that this child whose friendly interest in him had warmed his heart in a moment when his fortunes seemed so desperate should continue to be associated with his life on this new continent clara was evidently greatly impressed by the change in his appearance and could with difficulty be restrained from commenting upon it she proved a very apt scholar in music and enjoyed the lessons the more for her cordial liking of her teacher it will be necessary henceforth to omit the less significant details in the career of our friend mr birch before a month was past he had firmly established himself in the favor of the different members of the van kirk family mrs van kirk spoke of him to her lady visitors as a perfect jewel frequently leaving them in doubt as to whether he was a cook or a coachman edith apostrophized him to her fashionable friends as a real genius leaving a dim impression upon their minds of flowing locks a shiny velvet jacket slouched hat defiant neck tie and a general air of disreputable pretentiousness geniuses of the foreign type were never in the estimation of fashionable new york society what you would call exactly nice and against prejudices of this order no amount of argument will ever prevail clara who had by this time discovered that her teacher possessed an inexhaustible fund of fairy stories assured her playmates across the street that he was just splendid and frequently invited them over to listen to his wonderful tales mr van kirk himself of course was non committal but paid the bills unmurmuringly halfdan in the meanwhile was vainly struggling against his growing passion for edith but the more he rebelled the more hopelessly he found himself entangled in its inextricable net the fly as long as it keeps quiet in the spider's web may for a moment forget its situation but the least effort to escape is apt to frustrate itself and again reveal the imminent peril thus he too kicked against the pricks hoped feared rebelled against his destiny and again from sheer weariness relapsed into a dull benumbed apathy in spite of her friendly sympathy he never felt so keenly his alienism as in her presence she accepted the spontaneous homage he paid her sometimes with impatience as something that was really beneath her notice at other times she frankly recognized it bantered him with his old world chivalry which would soon evaporate in the practical american atmosphere and called him her viking her knight and her faithful squire but it never occurred to her to regard his devotion in a serious light and to look upon him as a possible lover had evidently never entered her head as their intercourse grew more intimate he had volunteered to read his favorite poets with her and had gradually succeeded in imparting to her something of his own passionate liking for heine and bjoernson she had in return called his attention to the works of american authors who had hitherto been little more than names to him and they had thus managed to be of mutual benefit to each other and to spend many a pleasant hour during the long winter afternoons in each other's company but edith had a very keen sense of humor and could hardly restrain her secret amusement when she heard him reading longfellow's psalm of life and poe's raven which had been familiar to her from her babyhood often with false accent but always with intense enthusiasm the reflection that he had had no part of his life in common with her that he did not love the things which she loved could not share her prejudices and women have a feeling akin to contempt for a man who does not respond to their prejudices removed him at times almost beyond the reach of her sympathy it was interesting enough as long as the experience was novel to be thus unconsciously exploring another person's mind and finding so many strange objects there but after a while the thing began to assume an uncomfortably serious aspect and then there seemed to be something almost terrible about it at such times a call from a gentleman of her own nation even though he were one of the placidly stupid type would be a positive relief she could abandon herself to the secure sense of being at home she need fear no surprises and in the smooth shallows of their talk there were no unsuspected depths to excite and to baffle her ingenuity and again reverting in her thought to halfdan his conversational brilliancy would almost repel her as something odious and un american the cheap result of outlandish birth and unrepublican education not that she had ever valued republicanism very highly she was one of those who associated politics with noisy vulgarity in speech and dress and therefore thanked fortune that women were permitted to keep aloof from it but in the presence of this alien she found herself growing patriotic that much discussed abstraction which we call our country and which is nothing but the aggregate of all the slow and invisible influences which go toward making up our own being became by degrees a very palpable and intelligible fact to her frequently while her american self was thus loudly asserting itself edith inflicted many a cruel wound upon her foreign adorer once it was the fourth of july more than a year after halfdan's arrival a number of young ladies and gentlemen after having listened to a patriotic oration were invited in to an informal luncheon while waiting they naturally enough spent their time in singing national songs and halfdan's clear tenor did good service in keeping the straggling voices together when they had finished edith went up to him and was quite effusive in her expressions of gratitude i am sure we ought all to be very grateful to you mr birch she said and i for my part can assure you that i am grateful why demanded halfdan looking quite unhappy for singing our national songs of course now won't you sing one of your own please we should all be so delighted to hear how a swedish or norwegian is it national song sounds yes mr birch do sing a swedish song echoed several voices they of course did not even remotely suspect their own cruelty he had in his enthusiasm for the day allowed himself to forget that he was not made of the same clay as they were that he was an exile and a stranger and must ever remain so that he had no right to share their joy in the blessing of liberty edith had taken pains to dispel the happy illusion and had sent him once more whirling toward his cold native pole his passion came near choking him and to conceal his impetuous emotion he flung himself down on the piano stool and struck some introductory chords with perhaps a little superfluous emphasis suddenly his voice burst out into the swedish national anthem our land our land our fatherland and the air shook and palpitated with strong martial melody his indignation his love and his misery imparted strength to his voice and its occasional tremble in the piano passages was something more than an artistic intention he was loudly applauded as he arose and the young ladies thronged about him to ask if he wouldn't please write out the music for them thus month after month passed by and every day brought its own misery mrs van kirk's patronizing manners and ostentatious kindness often tested his patience to the utmost if he was guilty of an innocent witticism or a little quaintness of expression she always assumed it to be a mistake of terms and corrected him with an air of benign superiority at times of course her corrections were legitimate as for instance when he spoke of wearing a cane instead of carrying one but in nine cases out of ten the fault lay in her own lack of imagination and not in his ignorance of english on such occasions edith often took pity on him defended him against her mother's criticism and insisted that if this or that expression was not in common vogue that was no reason why it should not be used as it was perfectly grammatical and moreover in keeping with the spirit of the language and he listening passively in admiring silence to her argument thanked her even for the momentary pain because it was followed by so great a happiness for it was so sweet to be defended by edith to feel that he and she were standing together side by side against the outer world could he only show her in the old heroic manner how much he loved her would only some one that was dear to her die so that he in that breaking down of social barriers which follows a great calamity might comfort her in her sorrow would she then perhaps weeping lean her wonderful head upon his breast feeling but that he was a fellow mortal who had a heart that was loyal and true and forgetting for one brief instant that he was a foreigner then to touch that delicate elizabethan frill which wound itself so daintily about edith's neck what inconceivable rapture but it was quite impossible it could never be these were selfish thoughts no doubt but they were a lover's selfishness and as such bore a close kinship to all that is purest and best in human nature it is one of the tragic facts of this life that a relation so unequal as that which existed between halfdan and edith is at all possible as for edith i must admit that she was well aware that her teacher was in love with her women have wonderfully keen senses for phenomena of that kind and it is an illusion if any one imagines as our norseman did that he has locked his secret securely in the hidden chamber of his heart in fleeting intonations unconscious glances and attitudes and through a hundred other channels it will make its way out and the bereaved jailer may still clasp his key in fierce triumph never knowing that he has been robbed it was of course no fault of edith's that she had become possessed of halfdan's heart secret she regarded it as on the whole rather an absurd affair and prized it very lightly that a love so strong and yet so humble so destitute of hope and still so unchanging reverent and faithful had something grand and touching in it had never occurred to her it is a truism to say that in our social code the value of a man's character is determined by his position and fine traits in a foreigner unless he should happen to be something very great strike us rather as part of a supposed mental alienism and as such naturally suspicious it is rather disgraceful than otherwise to have your music teacher in love with you and critical friends will never quite banish the suspicion that you have encouraged him edith had in her first delight at the discovery of halfdan's talent frankly admitted him to a relation of apparent equality he was a man of culture had the manners and bearing of a gentleman and had none of those theatrical airs which so often raise a sort of invisible wall between foreigners and americans her mother who loved to play the patron especially to young men had invited him to dinner parties and introduced him to their friends until almost every one looked upon him as a protege of the family he appeared so well in a parlor and had really such a distinguished presence that it was a pleasure to look at him he was remarkably free from those obnoxious traits which generalizing american travelers have led us to believe were inseparable from foreign birth his finger nails were in no way conspicuous he did not as a french count a former adorer of edith's had done indulge an unmasculine taste for diamond rings possibly because he had none his politeness was unobtrusive and subdued and of his accent there was just enough left to give an agreeable color of individuality to his speech but for all that edith could never quite rid herself of the impression that he was intensely un american there was a certain idyllic quiescence about him a child like directness and simplicity and a total absence of push which were startlingly at variance with the spirit of american life an american could never have been content to remain in an inferior position without trying in some way to better his fortunes but halfdan could stand still and see without the faintest stirring of envy his plebeian friend olson whose education and talents could bear no comparison with his own rise rapidly above him and apparently have no desire to emulate him he could sit on a cricket in a corner with clara on his lap and two or three little girls nestling about him and tell them fairy stories by the hour while his kindly face beamed with innocent happiness and if clara to coax him into continuing the entertainment offered to kiss him his measure of joy was full this fair child with her affectionate ways and her confiding prattle wound herself ever more closely about his homeless heart and he clung to her with a touching devotion for she was the only one who seemed to be unconscious of the difference of blood who had not yet learned that she was an american and he a foreigner vi three years had passed by and still the situation was unchanged halfdan still taught music and told fairy stories to the children he had a good many more pupils now than three years ago although he had made no effort to solicit patronage and had never tried to advertise his talent by what he regarded as vulgar and inartistic display but mrs van kirk who had by this time discovered his disinclination to assert himself had been only the more active had talked him up among her aristocratic friends had given musical soirees at which she had coaxed him to play the principal role and had in various other ways exerted herself in his behalf it was getting to be quite fashionable to admire his quiet unostentatious style of playing which was so far removed from the noisy bravado and clap trap then commonly in vogue even professional musicians began to indorse him and some who had discovered that there was money in him made him tempting offers for a public engagement but with characteristic modesty he distrusted their verdict his sensitive nature shrank from anything which had the appearance of self assertion or display but edith ah if it had not been for edith he might have found courage to enter at the door of fortune which was now opened ajar that fame if he should gain it would bring him any nearer to her was a thought that was alien to so unworldly a temperament as his and any action that had no bearing upon his relation to her left him cold seemed unworthy of the effort if she had asked him to play in public if she had required of him to go to the north pole or to cut his own throat i verily believe he would have done it and at last edith did ask him to play she and olson had plotted together and from the very friendliest motives agreed to play into each other's hands if you only would consent to play said she in her own persuasive way one day as they had finished their lesson we should all be so happy only think how proud we should be of your success for you know there is nothing you can't do in the way of music if you really want to do you really think so exclaimed he while his eyes suddenly grew large and luminous indeed i do said edith emphatically and if if i played well faltered he would it really please you of course it would cried edith laughing how can you ask such a foolish question because i hardly dared to believe it now listen to me continued the girl leaning forward in her chair and beaming all over with kindly officiousness now for once you must be rational and do just what i tell you i shall never like you again if you oppose me in this for i have set my heart upon it you must promise beforehand that you will be good and not make any objection do you hear when edith assumed this tone toward him she might well have made him promise to perform miracles she was too intent upon her benevolent scheme to heed the possible inferences which he might draw from her sudden display of interest then you promise repeated she eagerly as he hesitated to answer yes i promise now you must not be surprised but mamma and i have made arrangements with mr s that you are to appear under his auspices at a concert which is to be given a week from to night all our friends are going and we shall take up all the front seats and i have already told my gentlemen friends to scatter through the audience and"
