"1" "found that miss tita for such the name of this high tremulous spinster proved somewhat incongruously to be had an insatiable appetite for them when i speak of my suit as won i mean that before i left her she had promised that she would refer the question to her aunt i inquired who her aunt might be and she answered why miss bordereau with an air of surprise as if i might have been expected to know there were contradictions like this in tita bordereau which as i observed later contributed to make her an odd and affecting person it was the study of the two ladies to live so that the world should not touch them and yet they had never altogether accepted the idea that it never heard of them in tita at any rate a grateful susceptibility to human contact had not died out and contact of a limited order there would be if i should come to live in the house we have never done anything of the sort we have never had a lodger or any kind of inmate so much as this she made a point of saying to me we are very poor we live very badly the rooms are very bare that you might take they have nothing in them i don't know how you would sleep how you would eat with your permission i could easily put in a bed and a few tables and chairs c'est la moindre des choses and the affair of an hour or two i know a little man from whom i can hire what i should want for a few months for a trifle and my gondolier can bring the things round in his boat of course in this great house you must have a second kitchen and my servant who is a wonderfully handy fellow this personage was an evocation of the moment can easily cook me a chop there my tastes and habits are of the simplest i live on flowers and then i ventured to add that if they were very poor it was all the more reason they should let their rooms they were bad economists i had never heard of such a waste of material i saw in a moment that the good lady had never before been spoken to in that way with a kind of humorous firmness which did not exclude sympathy but was on the contrary founded on it she might easily have told me that my sympathy was impertinent but this by good fortune did not occur to her i left her with the understanding that she would consider the matter with her aunt and that i might come back the next day for their decision the aunt will refuse she will think the whole proceeding very louche mrs prest declared shortly after this when i had resumed my place in her gondola she had put the idea into my head and now so little are women to be counted on she appeared to take a despondent view of it her pessimism provoked me and i pretended to have the best hopes i went so far as to say that i had a distinct presentiment that i should succeed upon this mrs prest broke out oh i see what's in your head you fancy you have made such an impression in a quarter of an hour that she is dying for you to come and can be depended upon to bring the old one round if you do get in you'll count it as a triumph i did count it as a triumph but only for the editor in the last analysis not for the man who had not the tradition of personal conquest when i went back on the morrow the little maidservant conducted me straight through the long sala it opened there as before in perfect perspective and was lighter now which i thought a good omen into the apartment from which the recipient of my former visit had emerged on that occasion it was a large shabby parlor with a fine old painted ceiling and a strange figure sitting alone at one of the windows they come back to me now almost with the palpitation they caused the successive feelings that accompanied my consciousness that as the door of the room closed behind me i was really face to face with the juliana of some of aspern's most exquisite and most renowned lyrics i grew used to her afterward though never completely but as she sat there before me my heart beat as fast as if the miracle of resurrection had taken place for my benefit her presence seemed somehow to contain his and i felt nearer to him at that first moment of seeing her than i ever had been before or ever have been since yes i remember my emotions in their order even including a curious little tremor that took me when i saw that the niece was not there with her the day before i had become sufficiently familiar but it almost exceeded my courage much as i had longed for the event to be left alone with such a terrible relic as the aunt she was too strange too literally resurgent then came a check with the perception that we were not really face to face inasmuch as she had over her eyes a horrible green shade which for her served almost as a mask i believed for the instant that she had put it on expressly so that from underneath it she might scrutinize me without being scrutinized herself at the same time it increased the presumption that there was a ghastly death's head lurking behind it the divine juliana as a grinning skull the vision hung there until it passed then it came to me that she was tremendously old so old that death might take her at any moment before i had time to get what i wanted from her the next thought was a correction to that it lighted up the situation she would die next week she would die tomorrow then i could seize her papers meanwhile she sat there neither moving nor speaking she was very small and shrunken bent forward with her hands in her lap she was dressed in black and her head was wrapped in a piece of old black lace which showed no hair my emotion keeping me silent she spoke first and the remark she made was exactly the most unexpected iii our house is very far from the center but the little canal is very comme il faut it's the sweetest corner of venice and i can imagine nothing more charming i hastened to reply the old lady's voice was very thin and weak but it had an agreeable cultivated murmur and there was wonder in the thought that that individual note had been in jeffrey aspern's ear please to sit down there i hear very well she said quietly as if perhaps i had been shouting at her and the chair she pointed to was at a certain distance i took possession of it telling her that i was perfectly aware that i had intruded that i had not been properly introduced and could only throw myself upon her indulgence perhaps the other lady the one i had had the honor of seeing the day before would have explained to her about the garden that was literally what had given me courage to take a step so unconventional i had fallen in love at sight with the whole place she herself probably was so used to it that she did not know the impression it was capable of making on a stranger and i had felt it was really a case to risk something was her own kindness in receiving me a sign that i was not wholly out in my calculation it would render me extremely happy to think so i could give her my word of honor that i was a most respectable inoffensive person and that as an inmate they would be barely conscious of my existence i would conform to any regulations any restrictions if they would only let me enjoy the garden moreover i should be delighted to give her references guarantees they would be of the very best both in venice and in england as well as in america she listened to me in perfect stillness and i felt that she was looking at me with great attention though i could see only the lower part of her bleached and shriveled face independently of the refining process of old age it had a delicacy which once must have been great she had been very fair she had had a wonderful complexion she was silent a little after i had ceased speaking then she inquired if you are so fond of a garden why don't you go to terra firma where there are so many far better than this oh it's the combination i answered smiling and then with rather a flight of fancy it's the idea of a garden in the middle of the sea it's not in the middle of the sea you can't see the water i stared a moment wondering whether she wished to convict me of fraud can't see the water why dear madam i can come up to the very gate in my boat she appeared inconsequent for she said vaguely in reply to this yes if you have got a boat i haven't any it's many years since i have been in one of the gondolas she uttered these words as if the gondolas were a curious faraway craft which she knew only by hearsay let me assure you of the pleasure with which i would put mine at your service i exclaimed i had scarcely said this however before i became aware that the speech was in questionable taste and might also do me the injury of making me appear too eager too possessed of a hidden motive but the old woman remained impenetrable and her attitude bothered me by suggesting that she had a fuller vision of me than i had of her she gave me no thanks for my somewhat extravagant offer but remarked that the lady i had seen the day before was her niece she would presently come in she had asked her to stay away a little on purpose because she herself wished to see me at first alone she relapsed into silence and i asked myself why she had judged this necessary and what was coming yet also whether i might venture on some judicious remark in praise of her companion i went so far as to say that i should be delighted to see her again she had been so very courteous to me considering how odd she must have thought me a declaration which drew from miss bordereau another of her whimsical speeches she has very good manners i bred her up myself i was on the point of saying that that accounted for the easy grace of the niece but i arrested myself in time and the next moment the old woman went on i don't care who you may be i don't want to know it signifies very little today this had all the air of being a formula of dismissal as if her next words would be that i might take myself off now that she had had the amusement of looking on the face of such a monster of indiscretion therefore i was all the more surprised when she added with her soft venerable quaver you may have as many rooms as you like if you will pay a good deal of money i hesitated but for a single instant long enough to ask myself what she meant in particular by this condition first it struck me that she must have really a large sum in her mind then i reasoned quickly that her idea of a large sum would probably not correspond to my own my deliberation i think was not so visible as to diminish the promptitude with which i replied i will pay with pleasure and of course in advance whatever you may think is proper to ask me well then a thousand francs a month she rejoined instantly while her baffling green shade continued to cover her attitude the figure as they say was startling and my logic had been at fault the sum she had mentioned was by the venetian measure of such matters exceedingly large there was many an old palace in an out of the way corner that i might on such terms have enjoyed by the year but so far as my small means allowed i was prepared to spend money and my decision was quickly taken i would pay her with a smiling face what she asked but in that case i would give myself the compensation of extracting the papers from her for nothing moreover if she had asked five times as much i should have risen to the occasion so odious would it have appeared to me to stand chaffering with aspern's juliana it was queer enough to have a question of money with her at all i assured her that her views perfectly met my own and that on the morrow i should have the pleasure of putting three months rent into her hand she received this announcement with serenity and with no apparent sense that after all it would be becoming of her to say that i ought to see the rooms first this did not occur to her and indeed her serenity was mainly what i wanted our little bargain was just concluded when the door opened and the younger lady appeared on the threshold as soon as miss bordereau saw her niece she cried out almost gaily he will give three thousand three thousand tomorrow miss tita stood still with her patient eyes turning from one of us to the other then she inquired scarcely above her breath do you mean francs did you mean francs or dollars the old woman asked of me at this i think francs were what you said i answered smiling that is very good said miss tita as if she had become conscious that her own question might have looked overreaching what do you know you are ignorant miss bordereau remarked not with acerbity but with a strange soft coldness yes of money certainly of money miss tita hastened to exclaim i am sure you have your own branches of knowledge i took the liberty of saying genially there was something painful to me somehow in the turn the conversation had taken in the discussion of the rent she had a very good education when she was young i looked into that myself said miss bordereau then she added but she has learned nothing since i have always been with you miss tita rejoined very mildly and evidently with no intention of making an epigram yes but for that her aunt declared with more satirical force she evidently meant that but for this her niece would never have got on at all the point of the observation however being lost on miss tita though she blushed at hearing her history revealed to a stranger miss bordereau went on addressing herself to me and what time will you come tomorrow with the money the sooner the better if it suits you i will come at noon i am always here but i have my hours said the old woman as if her convenience were not to be taken for granted you mean the times when you receive i never receive but i will see you at noon when you come with the money very good i shall be punctual and i added may i shake hands with you on our contract i thought there ought to be some little form it would make me really feel easier for i foresaw that there would be no other besides though miss bordereau could not today be called personally attractive and there was something even in her wasted antiquity that bade one stand at one's distance i felt an irresistible desire to hold in my own for a moment the hand that jeffrey aspern had pressed for a minute she made no answer and i saw that my proposal failed to meet with her approbation she indulged in no movement of withdrawal which i half expected she only said coldly i belong to a time when that was not the custom i felt rather snubbed but i exclaimed good humoredly to miss tita oh you will do as well i shook hands with her while she replied with a small flutter yes yes to show it's all arranged shall you bring the money in gold miss bordereau demanded as i was turning to the door i looked at her for a moment aren't you a little afraid after all of keeping such a sum as that in the house it was not that i was annoyed at her avidity but i was really struck with the disparity between such a treasure and such scanty means of guarding it whom should i be afraid of if i am not afraid of you she asked with her shrunken grimness ah well said i laughing i shall be in point of fact a protector and i will bring gold if you prefer thank you the old woman returned with dignity and with an inclination of her head which evidently signified that i might depart i passed out of the room reflecting that it would not be easy to circumvent her as i stood in the sala again i saw that miss tita had followed me and i supposed that as her aunt had neglected to suggest that i should take a look at my quarters it was her purpose to repair the omission but she made no such suggestion she only stood there with a dim though not a languid smile and with an effect of irresponsible incompetent youth which was almost comically at variance with the faded facts of her person she was not infirm like her aunt but she struck me as still more helpless because her inefficiency was spiritual which was not the case with miss bordereau's i waited to see if she would offer to show me the rest of the house but i did not precipitate the question inasmuch as my plan was from this moment to spend as much of my time as possible in her society i only observed at the end of a minute i have had better fortune than i hoped it was very kind of her to see me perhaps you said a good word for me it was the idea of the money said miss tita and did you suggest that i told her that you would perhaps give a good deal what made you think that i told her i thought you were rich and what put that idea into your head i don't know the way you talked dear me i must talk differently now i declared i'm sorry to say it's not the case well said miss tita i think that in venice the forestieri in general often give a great deal for something that after all isn't much she appeared to make this remark with a comforting intention to wish to remind me that if i had been extravagant i was not really foolishly singular we walked together along the sala and as i took its magnificent measure i said to her that i was afraid it would not form a part of my quartiere were my rooms by chance to be among those that opened into it not if you go above on the second floor she answered with a little startled air as if she had rather taken for granted i would know my proper place and i infer that that's where your aunt would like me to be she said your apartments ought to be very distinct that certainly would be best and i listened with respect while she told me that up above i was free to take whatever i liked that there was another staircase but only from the floor on which we stood and that to pass from it to the garden story or to come up to my lodging i should have in effect to cross the great hall this was an immense point gained i foresaw that it would constitute my whole leverage in my relations with the two ladies when i asked miss tita how i was to manage at present to find my way up she replied with an access of that sociable shyness which constantly marked her manner perhaps you can't i don't see unless i should go with you she evidently had not thought of this before we ascended to the upper floor and visited a long succession of empty rooms the best of them looked over the garden some of the others had a view of the blue lagoon above the opposite rough tiled housetops they were all dusty and even a little disfigured with long neglect but i saw that by spending a few hundred francs i should be able to convert three or four of them into a convenient habitation my experiment was turning out costly yet now that i had all but taken possession i ceased to allow this to trouble me i mentioned to my companion a few of the things that i should put in but she replied rather more precipitately than usual that i might do exactly what i liked she seemed to wish to notify me that the misses bordereau would take no overt interest in my proceedings i guessed that her aunt had instructed her to adopt this tone and i may as well say now that i came afterward to distinguish perfectly as i believed between the speeches she made on her own responsibility and those the old lady imposed upon her she took no notice of the unswept condition of the rooms and indulged in no explanations nor apologies i said to myself that this was a sign that juliana and her niece disenchanting idea were untidy persons with a low italian standard but i afterward recognized that a lodger who had forced an entrance had no locus standi as a critic we looked out of a good many windows for there was nothing within the rooms to look at and still i wanted to linger i asked her what several different objects in the prospect might be but in no case did she appear to know she was evidently not familiar with the view it was as if she had not looked at it for years and i presently saw that she was too preoccupied with something else to pretend to care for it suddenly she said the remark was not suggested i don't know whether it will make any difference to you but the money is for me the money the money you are going to bring why you'll make me wish to stay here two or three years i spoke as benevolently as possible though it had begun to act on my nerves that with these women so associated with aspern the pecuniary question should constantly come back that would be very good for me she replied smiling you put me on my honor she looked as if she failed to understand this but went on she wants me to have more she thinks she is going to die ah not soon i hope i exclaimed with genuine feeling i had perfectly considered the possibility that she would destroy her papers on the day she should feel her end really approach i believed that she would cling to them till then and i think i had an idea that she read aspern's letters over every night or at least pressed them to her withered lips i would have given a good deal to have a glimpse of the latter spectacle i asked miss tita if the old lady were seriously ill and she replied that she was only very tired she had lived so very very long that was what she said herself she wanted to die for a change besides all her friends were dead long ago either they ought to have remained or she ought to have gone that was another thing her aunt often said she was not at all content but people don't die when they like do they miss tita inquired i took the liberty of asking why if there was actually enough money to maintain both of them there would not be more than enough in case of her being left alone she considered this difficult problem a moment and then she said oh well you know she takes care of me she thinks that when i'm alone i shall be a great fool i shall not know how to manage i should have supposed that you took care of her i'm afraid she is very proud why have you discovered that already miss tita cried with the glimmer of an illumination in her face i was shut up with her there for a considerable time and she struck me she interested me extremely it didn't take me long to make my discovery she won't have much to say to me while i'm here no i don't think she will my companion averred do you suppose she has some suspicion of me miss tita's honest eyes gave me no sign that i had touched a mark i shouldn't think so letting you in after all so easily oh so easily she has covered her risk but where is it that one could take an advantage of her i oughtn't to tell you if i knew ought i and miss tita added before i had time to reply to this smiling dolefully do you think we have any weak points that's exactly what i'm asking you would only have to mention them for me to respect them religiously she looked at me at this with that air of timid but candid and even gratified curiosity with which she had confronted me from the first and then she said there is nothing to tell we are terribly quiet i don't know how the days pass we have no life i wish i might think that i should bring you a little oh we know what we want she went on it's all right there were various things i desired to ask her how in the world they did live whether they had any friends or visitors any relations in america or in other countries but i judged such an inquiry would be premature i must leave it to a later chance well don't you be proud i contented myself with saying don't hide from me altogether oh i must stay with my aunt she returned without looking at me and at the same moment abruptly without any ceremony of parting she quitted me and disappeared leaving me to make my own way downstairs i remained a while longer wandering about the bright desert the sun was pouring in of the old house thinking the situation over on the spot not even the pattering little serva came to look after me and i reflected that after all this treatment showed confidence iv perhaps it did but all the same six weeks later toward the middle of june the moment when mrs prest undertook her annual migration i had made no measurable advance i was obliged to confess to her that i had no results to speak of my first step had been unexpectedly rapid but there was no appearance that it would be followed by a second i was a thousand miles from taking tea with my hostesses that privilege of which as i reminded mrs prest we both had had a vision she reproached me with wanting boldness and i answered that even to be bold you must have an opportunity you may push on through a breach but you can't batter down a dead wall she answered that the breach i had already made was big enough to admit an army and accused me of wasting precious hours in whimpering in her salon when i ought to have been carrying on the struggle in the field it is true that i went to see her very often on the theory that it would console me i freely expressed my discouragement for my want of success on my own premises but i began to perceive that it did not console me to be perpetually chaffed for my scruples especially when i was really so vigilant and i was rather glad when my derisive friend closed her house for the summer she had expected to gather amusement from the drama of my intercourse with the misses bordereau and she was disappointed that the intercourse and consequently the drama had not come off they'll lead you on to your ruin she said before she left venice they'll get all your money without showing you a scrap i think i settled down to my business with more concentration after she had gone away it was a fact that up to that time i had not save on a single brief occasion had even a moment's contact with my queer hostesses the exception had occurred when i carried them according to my promise the terrible three thousand francs then i found miss tita waiting for me in the hall and she took the money from my hand so that i did not see her aunt"
