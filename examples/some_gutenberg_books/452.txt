where he renewed his strength or calmed his temper with five excellent sausages and then came on to sheringham he told us there were three personages in the world whom he always had a desire to see two of these had slipped through his fingers so he was determined to see the third pray mr borrow who were they he held up three fingers of his left hand and pointed them off with the forefinger of the right the first daniel o'connell the second lamplighter the sire of phosphorus lord berners's winner of the derby the third anna gurney the first two were dead and he had not seen them now he had come to see anna gurney and this was the end of his visit i took him up to the hall he talking of many persons and occasionally doubling his fist and giving a sort of warning like that of his isopel berners in _lavengro_ to give the flaming tinman long melford with his right hand as soon as we reached the hall a battle piece by wouvermans was the first thing that caught his eye and greatly interested him he told me of a descendant of wouvermans an officer in the austrian army whom he knew then entering the drawing room and looking out of the bay window through the oak wood on the deep blue sea beyond he seemed for some time quite entranced by the lovely peaceful view till at last i felt i must arouse him and said a charming view mr borrow with a deep sigh he slowly answered yes please god the russians don't come here preface in the following pages i have endeavoured to describe a dream partly of study partly of adventure in which will be found copious notices of books and many descriptions of life and manners some in a very unusual form the scenes of action lie in the british islands pray be not displeased gentle reader if perchance thou hast imagined that i was about to conduct thee to distant lands and didst promise thyself much instruction and entertainment from what i might tell thee of them i do assure thee that thou hast no reason to be displeased inasmuch as there are no countries in the world less known by the british than these selfsame british islands or where more strange things are every day occurring whether in road or street house or dingle the time embraces nearly the first quarter of the present century this information again may perhaps be anything but agreeable to thee it is a long time to revert to but fret not thyself many matters which at present much occupy the public mind originated in some degree towards the latter end of that period and some of them will be treated of the principal actors in this dream or drama are as you will have gathered from the title page a scholar a gypsy and a priest should you imagine that these three form one permit me to assure you that you are very much mistaken should there be something of the gypsy manifest in the scholar there is certainly nothing of the priest with respect to the gypsy decidedly the most entertaining character of the three there is certainly nothing of the scholar or the priest in him and as for the priest though there may be something in him both of scholarship and gypsyism neither the scholar nor the gypsy would feel at all flattered by being confounded with him many characters which may be called subordinate will be found and it is probable that some of these characters will afford much more interest to the reader than those styled the principal the favourites with the writer are a brave old soldier and his helpmate an ancient gentlewoman who sold apples and a strange kind of wandering man and his wife amongst the many things attempted in this book is the encouragement of charity and free and genial manners and the exposure of humbug of which there are various kinds but of which the most perfidious the most debasing and the most cruel is the humbug of the priest yet let no one think that irreligion is advocated in this book with respect to religious tenets i wish to observe that i am a member of the church of england into whose communion i was baptized and to which my forefathers belonged its being the religion in which i was baptized and of my forefathers would be a strong inducement to me to cling to it for i do not happen to be one of those choice spirits who turn from their banner when the battle bears strongly against it and go over to the enemy and who receive at first a hug and a viva and in the sequel contempt and spittle in the face but my chief reason for belonging to it is because of all churches calling themselves christian ones i believe there is none so good so well founded upon scripture or whose ministers are upon the whole so exemplary in their lives and conversation so well read in the book from which they preach or so versed in general learning so useful in their immediate neighbourhoods or so unwilling to persecute people of other denominations for matters of doctrine in the communion of this church and with the religious consolation of its ministers i wish and hope to live and die and in its and their defence will at all times be ready if required to speak though humbly and to fight though feebly against enemies whether carnal or spiritual and is there no priestcraft in the church of england there is certainly or rather there was a modicum of priestcraft in the church of england but i have generally found that those who are most vehement against the church of england are chiefly dissatisfied with her because there is only a modicum of that article in her were she stuffed to the very cupola with it like a certain other church they would have much less to say against the church of england by the other church i mean rome its system was once prevalent in england and during the period that it prevailed there was more prolific of debasement and crime than all other causes united the people and the government at last becoming enlightened by means of the scripture spurned it from the island with disgust and horror the land instantly after its disappearance becoming a fair field in which arts sciences and all the amiable virtues flourished instead of being a pestilent marsh where swine like ignorance wallowed and artful hypocrites like so many wills o the wisp played antic gambols about around and above debased humanity but popery still wished to play her old part to regain her lost dominion to reconvert the smiling land into the pestilential morass where she could play again her old antics from the period of the reformation in england up to the present time she has kept her emissaries here individuals contemptible in intellect it is true but cat like and gliding who at her bidding have endeavoured as much as in their power has lain to damp and stifle every genial honest loyal and independent thought and to reduce minds to such a state of dotage as would enable their old popish mother to do what she pleased with them and in every country however enlightened there are always minds inclined to grovelling superstition minds fond of eating dust and swallowing clay minds never at rest save when prostrate before some fellow in a surplice and these popish emissaries found always some weak enough to bow down before them astounded by their dreadful denunciations of eternal woe and damnation to any who should refuse to believe their romania but they played a poor game the law protected the servants of scripture and the priest with his beads seldom ventured to approach any but the remnant of those of the eikonolatry representatives of worm eaten houses their debased dependants and a few poor crazy creatures amongst the middle classes he played a poor game and the labour was about to prove almost entirely in vain when the english legislature in compassion or contempt or yet more probably influenced by that spirit of toleration and kindness which is so mixed up with protestantism removed almost entirely the disabilities under which popery laboured and enabled it to raise its head and to speak out almost without fear and it did raise its head and though it spoke with some little fear at first soon discarded every relic of it went about the land uttering its damnation cry gathering around it and for doing so many thanks to it the favourers of priestcraft who lurked within the walls of the church of england frightening with the loudness of its voice the weak the timid and the ailing perpetrating whenever it had an opportunity that species of crime to which it has ever been most partial _deathbed robbery_ for as it is cruel so is it dastardly yes it went on enlisting plundering and uttering its terrible threats till till it became as it always does when left to itself a fool a very fool its plunderings might have been overlooked and so might its insolence had it been common insolence but it and then the roar of indignation which arose from outraged england against the viper the frozen viper which it had permitted to warm itself upon its bosom but thanks popery you have done all that the friends of enlightenment and religious liberty could wish but if ever there were a set of foolish ones to be found under heaven surely it is the priestly rabble who came over from rome to direct the grand movement so long in its getting up but now again the damnation cry is withdrawn there is a subdued meekness in your demeanour you are now once more harmless as a lamb well we shall see how the trick the old trick will serve you chapter i birth my father tamerlane ben brain french protestants east anglia sorrow and troubles true peace a beautiful child foreign grave mirrors alpine country emblems slow of speech the jew strange gestures on an evening of july in the year 18 at east d a beautiful little town in a certain district of east anglia i first saw the light my father was a cornish man the youngest as i have heard him say of seven brothers he sprang from a family of gentlemen or as some people would call them gentillatres for they were not very wealthy they had a coat of arms however and lived on their own property at a place called tredinnock which being interpreted means _the house on the hill_ which house and the neighbouring acres had been from time immemorial in their possession i mention these particulars that the reader may see at once that i am not altogether of low and plebeian origin the present age is highly aristocratic and i am convinced that the public will read my pages with more zest from being told that i am a gentillatre by birth with cornish blood 5 in my veins of a family who lived on their own property at a place bearing a celtic name signifying the house on the hill or more strictly the house on the _hillock_ my father was what is generally termed a posthumous child in other words the gentillatre who begot him never had the satisfaction of invoking the blessing of the father of all upon his head having departed this life some months before the birth of his youngest son the boy therefore never knew a father's care he was however well tended by his mother whose favourite he was so much so indeed that his brethren the youngest of whom was considerably older than himself were rather jealous of him i never heard however that they treated him with any marked unkindness and it will be as well to observe here that i am by no means well acquainted with his early history of which indeed as i am not writing his life it is not necessary to say much shortly after his mother's death which occurred when he was eighteen he adopted the profession of arms which he followed during the remainder of his life and in which had circumstances permitted he would probably have shone amongst the best by nature he was cool and collected slow to anger though perfectly fearless patient of control of great strength and to crown all a proper man with his hands with far inferior qualifications many a man has become a field marshal or general similar ones made tamerlane who was not a gentillatre but the son of a blacksmith emperor of one third of the world but the race is not always for the swift nor the battle for the strong indeed i ought rather to say very seldom certain it is that my father with all his high military qualifications never became emperor field marshal or even general indeed he had never an opportunity of distinguishing himself save in one battle and that took place neither in flanders egypt nor on the banks of the indus or oxus but in hyde park smile not gentle reader many a battle has been fought in hyde park in which as much skill science and bravery have been displayed as ever achieved a victory in flanders or by the indus in such a combat as that to which i allude i opine that even wellington or napoleon would have been heartily glad to cry for quarter ere the lapse of five minutes and even the blacksmith tartar would perhaps have shrunk from the opponent with whom after having had a dispute with him my father engaged in single combat for one hour at the end of which time the champions shook hands and retired each having experienced quite enough of the other's prowess the name of my father's antagonist was brain what still a smile did you never hear that name before i cannot help it honour to brain who four months after the event which i have now narrated was champion of england having conquered the heroic johnson honour to brain who at the end of other four months worn out by the dreadful blows which he had received in his manly combats expired in the arms of my father who read the bible to him in his latter moments big ben brain you no longer smile even _you_ have heard of big ben i have already hinted that my father never rose to any very exalted rank in his profession notwithstanding his prowess and other qualifications after serving for many years in the line he at last entered as captain in the militia regiment of the earl of at that period just raised and to which he was sent by the duke of york to instruct the young levies in military manoeuvres and discipline and in this mission i believe he perfectly succeeded competent judges having assured me that the regiment in question soon came by his means to be considered as one of the most brilliant in the service and inferior to no regiment of the line in appearance or discipline as the headquarters of this corps were at d the duties of my father not unfrequently carried him to that place and it was on one of these occasions that he became acquainted with a young person of the neighbourhood for whom he formed an attachment which was returned and this young person was my mother she was descended from a family of french protestants natives of caen who were obliged to leave their native country when old louis at the instigation of the pope thought fit to revoke the edict of nantes their name was petrement and i have reason for believing that they were people of some consideration that they were noble hearts and good christians they gave sufficient proof in scorning to bow the knee to the tyranny of rome so they left beautiful normandy for their faith's sake and with a few louis d'ors in their purse a bible in the vulgar tongue and a couple of old swords which if report be true had done service in the huguenot wars they crossed the sea to the isle of civil peace and religious liberty and established themselves in east anglia and many other huguenot families bent their steps thither and devoted themselves to agriculture or the mechanical arts and in the venerable old city the capital of the province in the northern shadow of the castle of de burgh the exiles built for themselves a church where they praised god in the french tongue and to which at particular seasons of the year they were in the habit of flocking from country and from town to sing thou hast provided for us a goodly earth thou waterest her furrows thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof thou makest it soft with the drops of rain and blessest the increase of it i have been told that in her younger days my mother was strikingly handsome this i can easily believe i never knew her in her youth for though she was very young when she married my father who was her senior by many years she had attained the middle age before i was born no children having been vouchsafed to my parents in the early stages of their union yet even at the present day now that years threescore and ten have passed over her head attended with sorrow and troubles manifold poorly chequered with scanty joys can i look on that countenance and doubt that at one time beauty decked it as with a glorious garment hail to thee my parent as thou sittest there in thy widow's weeds in the dusky parlour in the house overgrown with the lustrous ivy of the sister isle the solitary house at the end of the retired court shaded by lofty poplars hail to thee dame of the oval face olive complexion and grecian forehead by thy table seated with the mighty volume of the good bishop hopkins spread out before thee there is peace in thy countenance my mother it is not worldly peace however not the deceitful peace which lulls to bewitching slumbers and from which let us pray humbly pray that every sinner may be roused in time to implore mercy not in vain thine is the peace of the righteous my mother of those to whom no sin can be imputed the score of whose misdeeds has been long since washed away by the blood of atonement which imputeth righteousness to those who trust in it it was not always thus my mother a time was when the cares pomps and vanities of this world agitated thee too much but that time is gone by another and a better has succeeded there is peace now on thy countenance the true peace peace around thee too in thy solitary dwelling sounds of peace the cheerful hum of the kettle and the purring of the immense angola which stares up at thee from its settle with its almost human eyes no more earthly cares and affections now my mother yes one why dost thou suddenly raise thy dark and still brilliant eye from the volume with a somewhat startled glance what noise is that in the distant street merely the noise of a hoof a sound common enough it draws nearer nearer and now it stops before thy gate singular and now there is a pause a long pause ha thou hearest something a footstep a swift but heavy footstep thou risest thou tremblest there is a hand on the pin of the outer door there is some one in the vestibule and now the door of thy apartment opens there is a reflection on the mirror behind thee a travelling hat a gray head and sunburnt face my dearest son my darling mother yes mother thou didst recognise in the distant street the hoof tramp of the wanderer's horse i was not the only child of my parents i had a brother some three years older than myself he was a beautiful child one of those occasionally seen in england and in england alone a rosy angelic face blue eyes and light chestnut hair it was not exactly an anglo saxon countenance in which by the bye there is generally a cast of loutishness and stupidity it partook to a certain extent of the celtic character particularly in the fire and vivacity which illumined it his face was the mirror of his mind perhaps no disposition more amiable was ever found amongst the children of adam united however with no inconsiderable portion of high and dauntless spirit so great was his beauty in infancy that people especially those of the poorer classes would follow the nurse who carried him about in order to look at and bless his lovely face at the age of three months an attempt was made to snatch him from his mother's arms in the streets of london at the moment she was about to enter a coach indeed his appearance seemed to operate so powerfully upon every person who beheld him that my parents were under continual apprehension of losing him his beauty however was perhaps surpassed by the quickness of his parts he mastered his letters in a few hours and in a day or two could decipher the names of people on the doors of houses and over the shop windows as he grew up his personal appearance became less prepossessing his quickness and cleverness however rather increased and i may say of him that with respect to everything which he took in hand he did it better and more speedily than any other person perhaps it will be asked here what became of him alas alas his was an early and a foreign grave as i have said before the race is not always for the swift nor the battle for the strong and now doubtless after the above portrait of my brother painted in the very best style of rubens the reader will conceive himself justified in expecting a full length one of myself as a child for as to my present appearance i suppose he will be tolerably content with that flitting glimpse in the mirror but he must excuse me i have no intention of drawing a portrait of myself in childhood indeed it would be difficult for at that time i never looked into mirrors no attempts however were ever made to steal me in my infancy and i never heard that my parents entertained the slightest apprehension of losing me by the hands of kidnappers though i remember perfectly well that people were in the habit of standing still to look at me ay more than at my brother from which premisses the reader may form any conclusion with respect to my appearance which seemeth good unto him and reasonable should he being a good natured person and always inclined to adopt the charitable side in any doubtful point be willing to suppose that i too was eminently endowed by nature with personal graces i tell him frankly that i have no objection whatever to his entertaining that idea moreover that i heartily thank him and shall at all times be disposed under similar circumstances to exercise the same species of charity towards himself with respect to my mind and its qualities i shall be more explicit for were i to maintain much reserve on this point many things which appear in these memoirs would be highly mysterious to the reader indeed incomprehensible perhaps no two individuals were ever more unlike in mind and disposition than my brother and myself as light is opposed to darkness so was that happy brilliant cheerful child to the sad and melancholy being who sprang from the same stock as himself and was nurtured by the same milk once when travelling in an alpine country i arrived at a considerable elevation i saw in the distance far below a beautiful stream hastening to the ocean its rapid waters here sparkling in the sunshine and there tumbling merrily in cascades on its banks were vineyards and cheerful villages close to where i stood in a granite basin with steep and precipitous sides slumbered a deep dark lagoon shaded by black pines cypresses and yews it was a wild savage spot strange and singular ravens hovered above the pines filling the air with their uncouth notes pies chattered and i heard the cry of an eagle from a neighbouring peak there lay the lake the dark solitary and almost inaccessible lake gloomy shadows were upon it which strangely modified as gusts of wind agitated the surface occasionally assumed the shape of monsters so i stood on the alpine elevation and looked now on the gay distant river and now at the dark granite encircled lake close beside me in the lone solitude and i thought of my brother and myself i am no moraliser but the gay and rapid river and the dark and silent lake were of a verity no had emblems of us two so far from being quick and clever like my brother and able to rival the literary feat which i have recorded of him many years elapsed before i was able to understand the nature of letters or to connect them a lover of nooks and retired corners i was as a child in the habit of fleeing from society and of sitting for hours together with my head on my breast what i was thinking about it would be difficult to say at this distance of time i remember perfectly well however being ever conscious of a peculiar heaviness within me and at times of a strange sensation of fear which occasionally amounted to horror and for which i could assign no real cause whatever by nature slow of speech i took no pleasure in conversation nor in hearing the voices of my fellow creatures when people addressed me i not unfrequently especially if they were strangers turned away my head from them and if they persisted in their notice burst into tears which singularity of behaviour by no means tended to dispose people in my favour i was as much disliked as my brother was deservedly beloved and admired my parents it is true were always kind to me and my brother who was good nature itself was continually lavishing upon me every mark of affection there was however one individual who in the days of my childhood was disposed to form a favourable opinion of me one day a jew i have quite forgotten the circumstance but i was long subsequently informed of it one day a travelling jew knocked at the door of a farmhouse in which we had taken apartments i was near at hand sitting in the bright sunshine drawing strange lines on the dust with my fingers an ape and dog were my companions the jew looked at me and asked me some questions to which though i was quite able to speak i returned no answer on the door being opened the jew after a few words probably relating to pedlery demanded who the child was sitting in the sun the maid replied that i was her mistress's youngest son a child weak _here_ pointing to her forehead the jew looked at me again and then said pon my conscience my dear i believe that you must be troubled there yourself to tell me any such thing it is not my habit to speak to children inasmuch as i hate them because they often follow me and fling stones after me but i no sooner looked at that child than i was forced to speak to it his not answering me shows his sense for it has never been the custom of the wise to fling away their words in indifferent talk and conversation the child is a sweet child and has all the look of one of our people's children fool indeed did i not see his eyes sparkle just now when the monkey seized the dog by the ear they shone like my own diamonds does your good lady want any real and fine were it not for what you tell me i should say it was a prophet's child fool indeed he can write already or i'll forfeit the box which i carry on my back and for which i should be loth to take two hundred pounds he then leaned forward to inspect the lines which i had traced all of a sudden he started back and grew white as a sheet then taking off his hat he made some strange gestures to me cringing chattering and showing his teeth and shortly departed muttering something about holy letters and talking to himself in a strange tongue the words of the jew were in due course of time reported to my mother who treasured them in her heart and from that moment began to entertain brighter hopes of her youngest born than she had ever before ventured to foster picture:all of a sudden he started back and grew white as a sheet page13 jpg chapter ii barracks and lodgings a camp the viper a delicate child blackberry time _meun_"
