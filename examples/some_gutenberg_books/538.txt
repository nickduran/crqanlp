"1" "as it was he pulled up and waited while carl opened the wire gate and dragged it to one side from the look of his face carl also would have avoided the meeting if he could have done so he glanced up as lite passed through hell of a verdict lite made brief comment when he met carl's eyes carl stopped leaning against his horse with one hand thrown up to the saddle horn he was a small man not at all like aleck in size or in features he looked haggard now and white what do you make of it he asked lite do you believe of course i don't great question for a brother to ask lite retorted sharply it's not in aleck to do a thing like that what made you say you saw him ride home you didn't did you you heard what i said take it or leave it lite scowled down at carl what was there queer about it why if you'd been inside ten minutes before then carl told him bluntly you'd have heard aleck say he came home a full hour or more before you say you saw him ride in that's what's queer what made you do that it won't help aleck none well what are you going to do about it lite slouched miserably in the saddle and eyed the other without really seeing him at all they can't prove anything on aleck he added with faint hope i don't see myself how they can carl brightened perceptibly his being alone all day is bad he can't furnish the alibi you can furnish but they can't prove anything they'll turn him loose the grand jury will they'll have to they can't indict him on the evidence they haven't got any evidence not any more than just the fact that he rode in with the news no need to worry he'll be turned loose in a few days he picked up the gate dragged it after him as he went through and fumbled the wire loop into place over the post i wish he said when he had mounted with the gate between them you hadn't been so particular to say you saw him ride home about the same time you did that looks bad lite bad for who lite turned in the saddle aggressively looks bad all around i don't see what made you do that not when you knew jim and aleck had both testified before you did lite rode slowly down the road to the stable and cursed the impulse that had made him blunder so he had no compunctions for the lie if only it had done any good it had done harm he could see now that it had but he could not believe that it would make any material difference in aleck's case as the story had been repeated to lite by half a dozen men who had heard him tell it aleck's own testimony had been responsible for the verdict men had told lite plainly that aleck was a fool not to plead self defense even in face of the fact that johnny croft had not drawn any weapon jim had declared that aleck could have sworn that johnny reached for his gun others admitted voluntarily that while it would be a pretty weak defense it would beat the story aleck had told lite turned the mare and colt into a shed for the night he milked the two cows without giving any thought to what he was doing and carried the milk to the kitchen door before he realized that it would be wasted sitting in pans when the house would be empty still it occurred to him that he might as well go on with the routine of the place until they knew to a certainty what the grand jury would do so he went in and put away the milk after that lite let other work wait while he cleaned the kitchen and tried to wash out that brown stain on the floor his face was moody his eyes dull with trouble like a treadmill his mind went over and over the meager knowledge he had of the tragedy he could not bring himself to believe aleck douglas guilty of the murder yet he could not believe anything else johnny croft it had been proven at the inquest rode out from town alone bent on mischief if vague half drunken threats meant anything he had told more than one that he was going to the lazy a but it was certain that no one had followed him from town his threats had been for the most part directed against carl it is true but if he had meant to quarrel with carl he would have gone to the bar nothing instead of the lazy a probably he had meant to see both carl and aleck and had come here first since it was the nearest to town as to enemies no one had particularly liked johnny he was not a likeable sort he was too mouthy according to his associates he had quarreled with a good many for slight cause but since he was so notoriously blatant and argumentative no one had taken him seriously enough to nurse any grudge that would be likely to breed assassination it was inconceivable to lite that any man had trailed johnny croft to the lazy a and shot him down in the kitchen while he was calmly helping himself to jean's gingerbread still he must take that for granted or else believe what he steadfastly refused to confess even to himself that he believed it was nearly dark when he threw out the last pail of water and stood looking down dissatisfied at the result of his labor while he dried his hands the stain was still there in spite of him just as the memory of the murder would cling always to the place he went out and watered jean's poppies and sweet peas and pansies still going over and over the evidence and trying to fill in the gaps he had blundered with his lie that had meant to help the lie had proven to every man who heard him utter it that his faith in aleck's innocence was not strong it had proven that he did not trust the facts that hurt lite and made it seem more than ever his task to clear up the matter if he could if he could not then he would make amends in whatever way he might almost as if he were guarding that gruesome room which was empty now and silent since the clock had not been wound and had run down he sat long upon the narrow platform before the kitchen door and smoked and stared straight before him once he thought he saw a man move cautiously from the corner of the shed where the youngest calf slept beside its mother he had been thinking so deeply of other things that he was not sure but he went down there his cigarette glowing in the gloom and stood looking and listening he neither saw nor heard anything and presently he went back to the house but his abstraction was broken by the fancy so that he did not sit down again to smoke and think he had thought until his brain felt heavy and stupid and the last cigarette he lighted he threw away for he had smoked until his tongue was sore he went in and went to bed for a long time he lay awake finally he dropped into a sleep so heavy that it was nearer to a torpor and it was the sunlight that awoke him sunlight that was warm in the room and proved how late the morning was he swore in his astonishment and got up hastily a great deal more optimistic than when he had lain down and hurried out to feed the stock before he boiled coffee and fried eggs for himself it was when he went in to cook his belated breakfast that lite noticed something which had no logical explanation there were footprints on the kitchen floor that he had scrubbed so diligently he stood looking at them much as he had looked at the stain that would not come out no matter how hard he scrubbed he had not gone in the room after he had pulled the door shut and gone off to water jean's dowers he was positive upon that point and even if he had gone in his tracks would scarcely have led straight across the room to the cupboard where the table dishes were kept the tracks led to the cupboard and were muddled confusedly there as though the maker had stood there for some minutes lite could not see any sense in that they were very distinct just as footprints always show plainly on clean boards the floor had evidently been moist still lite had scrubbed man fashion with a broom and had not been very particular about drying the floor afterwards also he had thrown the water straight out from the door and the fellow must have stepped on the moist sand that clung to his boots in the dark he could not notice that or see that he had left tracks on the floor lite went to the cupboard and looked inside it wondering what the man could have wanted there it was one of those old fashioned safes such as our grandmothers considered indispensable in the furnishing of a kitchen it held the table dishes neatly piled dinner plates at the end of the middle shelf smaller plates next then a stack of saucers the arrangement stereotyped unvarying since first lite avery had taken dishtowel in hand to dry the dishes for jean when she was ten and stood upon a footstool so that her elbows would be higher than the rim of the dishpan the cherry blossom dinner set that had come from the mail order house long ago was chipped now and incomplete but the familiar rows gave lite an odd sense of the unreality of the tragedy that had so lately taken place in that room clearly there was nothing there to tempt a thief and there was nothing disturbed lite straightened up and looked down thoughtfully upon the top of the cupboard where jean had stacked out of date newspapers and magazines and where aleck had laid a pair of extra gloves he pulled out the two small drawers just under the cupboard top and looked within them the first held pipes and sacks of tobacco and books of cigarette papers lite knew well enough the contents of that drawer he appraised the supply of tobacco remembered how much had been there on the morning of the murder and decided that none had been taken he helped himself to a fresh ten cent sack of tobacco and inspected the other drawer here were merchants bills a few letters of no consequence a couple of writing tablets two lead pencils and a steel pen and a squat bottle of ink this was called the writing drawer and had been since lite first came to the ranch here lite believed the confusion was recent jean had been very domestic since her return from school and all disorder had been frowned upon lately the letters had been stacked in a corner whereas now they were scattered but they were of no consequence once they had been read and there was nothing else to merit attention from any one lite looked down at the tracks and saw that they led into another room which was aleck's bedroom he went in there but he could not find any reason for a night prowler's visit aleck's desk was always open there was never anything there which he wanted to hide away his account books and his business correspondence such as it was lay accessible to the curious there was nothing intricate or secret about the running of the lazy a ranch nothing that should interest any one save the owner it occurred to lite that incriminating evidence is sometimes placed surreptitiously in a suspected man's desk he had heard of such things being done he could not imagine what evidence might be placed here by any one but he made a thorough search he did not find anything that remotely concerned the murder he looked through the living room and even opened the door which led from the kitchen into jean's room which had been built on to the rest of the house a few years before he could not find any excuse for those footprints he cooked and ate his breakfast absent mindedly glancing often down at the footprints on the floor and occasionally at the brown stain in the center he decided that he would not say anything about those tracks he would keep his eyes open and his mouth shut and see what came of it chapter iii what a man's good name is worth you would think that the bare word of a man who has lived uprightly in a community for fifteen years or so would be believed under oath even if his whole future did depend upon it you would think that aleck douglas could not be convicted of murder just because he had reported that a man was shot down in aleck's house the report of aleck douglas trial is not the main feature of this story it is merely the commencement one might say therefore i am going to be brief as i can and still give you a clear idea of the situation and then i am going to skip the next three years and begin where the real story begins aleck's position was dishearteningly simple and there was nothing much that one could do to soften the facts or throw a new light on the murder lite watched wide awake and eager many a night for the return of that prowler but he never saw or heard a thing that gave him any clue whatever so the footprints seemed likely to remain the mystery they had seemed on the morning when he discovered them he laid traps pretending to ride away from the ranch to town before dark and returning cautiously by way of the trail down the bluff behind the house but nothing came of it lazy a ranch was keeping its secret well and by the time the trial was begun lite had given up hope once he believed the house had been visited in the daytime during his absence in town but he could not be sure of that jean went to chinook and stayed there so that lite saw her seldom carl also was away much of the time trying by every means he could think of to swing public opinion and the evidence in aleck's favor he prevailed upon rossman who was montana's best known lawyer to defend the case for one thing he seemed to pin his faith almost wholly upon rossman and declared to every one that aleck would never be convicted it would be he maintained impossible to convict him with rossman handling the case and he always added the statement that you can't send an innocent man to jail if things are handled right perhaps he did not after all handle things right for in spite of rossman and aleck's splendid reputation and the meager evidence against him he was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in deer lodge penitentiary rossman had made a great speech and had made men in the jury blink back unshed tears but he could not shake from them the belief that aleck douglas had ridden home and met johnny croft calmly making himself at home in the lazy a kitchen he could not convince them that there had not been a quarrel and that aleck had not fired the shot in the grip of a sudden overwhelming rage against croft by aleck's own statement he had been at the ranch some time before he had started for town to report the murder by the word of several witnesses it had been proven that croft had left town meaning to collect wages which he claimed were due him or else he would get even his last words to a group out by the hitching pole in front of the saloon which was johnny's hangout were i'm going to get what's coming to me or there'll be one fine large bunch of trouble he had not mentioned aleck douglas by name it is true but the fact that he had been found at the lazy a was proof enough that he had referred to aleck when he spoke there is no means of knowing just how far reaching was the effect of that impulsive lie which lite had told at the inquest he did not repeat the blunder at the trial when the district attorney reminded lite of the statement he had made lite had calmly explained that he had made a mistake he should have said that he had seen aleck ride away from the ranch instead of to it beyond that he would not go question him as they might the judge sentenced aleck to eight years and publicly regretted the fact that aleck had persisted in asserting his innocence had he pleaded guilty instead the judge more than hinted the sentence would have been made as light as the law would permit it was the stubborn denial of the deed in the face of all reason he said that went far toward weaning from the prisoner what sympathy he would otherwise have commanded from the public and the court of justice you know how those things go there was nothing particularly out of the ordinary in the case we read of such things in the paper and a paragraph or two is considered sufficient space to give so commonplace a happening but there was lite loyal to his last breath in the face of his secret belief that aleck was probably guilty loyal and blaming himself bitterly for hurting aleck's cause when he had meant only to help there was jean dazed by the magnitude of the catastrophe that had overtaken them all clinging to lite as to the only part of her home that was left to her steadfastly refusing to believe that they would actually take her dad away to prison until the very last minute when she stood on the crowded depot platform and watched in dry eyed misery while the train slid away and bore him out of her life these things are not put in the papers come on jean lite took her by the arm and swung her away from the curious crowd which she did not see you're my girl now and i'm going to start right in using my authority i've got pard here in the stable you go climb into your riding clothes and we'll hit it outa this darned burg where every man and his dog has all gone to eyes and tongues they make me sick come on where jean held back a little with vague stubbornness against the thought of taking up life again without her dad this this is the jumping off place lite there's nothing beyond lite gripped her arm a little tighter if anything and led her across the street and down the high sidewalk that bridged a swampy tract at the edge of town beyond the depot we're taking the long way round he observed because i'm going to talk to you like a dutch uncle for saying things like that i had a talk with your dad last night jean he's turned you over to me to look after till he gets back i wish he coulda turned the ranch over along with you but he couldn't that's been signed over to carl somehow i didn't go into that with your dad we didn't have much time seems carl put up the money to pay rossman and other things and took over the ranch to square it anyway i haven't got anything to say about the business end of the deal i've got permission to boss you though and i'm sure going to do it to a fare you well he cast a sidelong glance down at her he could not see anything of her face except the droop of her mouth a bit of her cheek and her chin that promised firmness her mouth did not change expression in the slightest degree until she moved her lips in speech i don't care what is there to boss me about the world has stopped her voice was steady and it was also sullen right there is where the need of bossing begins you can't stay in town any longer there's nothing here to keep you from going crazy and the allens are altogether too sympathetic nice folks and they mean well but you don't want a bunch like that slopping around crying all over you and keeping you in mind of things i'm going to work for carl from now on you're going out there to the bar nothing he felt a stiffening of the muscles under his fingers and answered calmly the signal of rebellion sure that's the place for you your dad and carl fixed that up between them anyway that's to be your home so my saying so is just an extra rope to bring you along peaceable you're going to stay at the bar nothing and i'm going to make a top hand outa you jean i'm going to teach you to shoot and rope and punch cows and ride till there won't be a girl in the united states to equal you what for jean still had an air of sullen apathy that won't help dad any it'll start the world moving again lite forced himself to cheerfulness in the face of his own despondency you say it's stopped it's us that have stopped we've come to a blind pocket you might say in the trail we've been taking through life we've got to start in a new place that's all now i know you're dead game jean at least i know you used to be and i'm gambling on school not taking that outa you you're maybe thinking about going away off somewhere among strangers but that wouldn't do at all your dad always counted on keeping you away from town life i'm just going to ride herd on you jean and see to it that you go on the way your dad wanted you to go he can't be on the job and so i'm what you might call his foreman i know how he wants you to grow up i'm going to make it my business to grow you according to directions he saw a little quirk of her lips at that and was vastly encouraged thereby has it struck you that you're liable to have your hands full she asked him with a certain drawl that jean had possessed since she first learned to express herself in words sure i'll likely have both hand and my hat full of trouble but she's going to be done according to contract i reckon i'll wish you was a bronk before i'm through what maddens me so that i could run amuck down this street shooting everybody i saw jean flared out suddenly is the sickening injustice of it dad never did that you know he never did it she turned upon him fiercely do you think he did she demanded her eyes boring into his now that's a bright question to be asking me ain't it lite rebuked that's a real bright sensible question i must say i reckon you ought to be stood in the corner for that but i'll let it go this time only don't never spring anything like that again jean looked ashamed i could doubt god himself right now she gritted through her teeth well don't doubt me unless you want a scrap on your hands lite warned i'm sure ashamed of you we'll stop here at the stable and get the horses you can ride sideways as far as the allens and get your riding skirt and come on the sooner you are on top of a horse the quicker you're going to come outa that state of mind it was pitifully amusing to see lite avery attempt to bully any one especially jean who might almost be called lite's religion the idea of that long lank cowpuncher whose shyness was so ingrained that it had every outward appearance of being a phlegmatic coldness assuming the duties of jean's dad and undertaking to see that she grew up according to directions would have been funny if he had not been so absolutely in earnest his method of comforting her and easing her through the first stage of black despair was unorthodox but it was effective because she was too absorbed in her own misery to combat him openly he got her started toward the bar nothing and away from the friends whose enervating pity was at that time the worst influence possible he set the pace and he set it for speed the first mile they went at a sharp gallop that was not far from a run and the horses were breathing heavily when he pulled up well out of sight of the town and turned to the girl there was color in her cheeks and the dullness was gone from her eyes when she returned his glance inquiringly the droop of her lips was no longer the droop of a weak yielding to sorrow but rather the beginning of a brave facing of the future lite managed a grin that did not look forced i'll make a real range hand outa you yet he announced confidently you remember the roping and shooting science i taught you before you went off to school you're going to start right in where you left off and learn all i know and some besides i'll make a lady of you yet darned if i don't at that jean laughed unexpectedly lite drew a long breath of relief chapter iv jean the still loneliness of desertion held fast the clutter of sheds and old stables roofed with dirt and rotting hay the melancholy of emptiness hung like an invisible curtain before the sprawling house with warped weather blackened shingles and sagging window frames you felt the silence when first you sighted the ranch buildings from the broad mouth of the lazy a coulee the broad mouth that yawned always at the narrow valley and the undulations of the open range and the purple line of mountains beyond you felt it more strongly when you rode up to the gate of barbed wire spliced here and there and having an unexpected stubbornness to harry the patience of men who would pass through it in haste you grew unaccountably depressed if you rode on past the stables and corrals to the house where the door was closed but never locked and opened with a squeal of rusty hinges if you turned the brown earthenware knob and at the same instant pressed sharply with your knee against the paintless panel you might notice the brown spot on the kitchen door where a man had died you might notice the brown spot but unless you had been told the grim story of the lazy a you would never guess the spot was a bloodstain even though you guessed and shuddered you would forget it presently in the amazement with which you opened the door beyond and looked in upon a room where the chill atmosphere of the whole place could find no lodgment this was jean's room held sacred to her own needs and uses in defiance of the dreariness that compassed it close a square of old rag carpet covered the center of the floor and beyond its border the warped boards were painted a dull pale green the walls were ugly with a cheap flowered paper that had done its best to fade into inoffensive neutral tints jean had helped where she could by covering the intricate rose pattern with old prints cut from magazines and with cheap pretty souvenirs gleaned here and there and hoarded jealously and there were books which caught the eyes and held them even to forgetfulness of the paper you would laugh at jean's room just at first you would laugh after that you would want to cry or pat jean on her hard muscled capable shoulder but if you knew jean at all you would not do either first you would notice an old wooden cradle painted blue that stood in a corner a button eyed blank faced rag doll the size of a baby at the fist sucking age was tucked neatly under the red and white patchwork quilt made to fit the cradle hanging directly over the cradle by a stirrup was jean's first saddle a cheap pigskin affair with harsh straps and buckles that her father had sent east for jean never had liked that saddle even when it was new she used to stand perfectly still while her father buckled it on the little buckskin pony she rode and she would laugh when he picked her up and tossed her into the seat she would throw her dad a kiss and go galloping off down the trail but when she was quite out of sight around the bend of the bench land she would stop and take the saddle off and hide it in a certain clump of wild currant bushes"
