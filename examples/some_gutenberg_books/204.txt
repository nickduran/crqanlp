"1" "which he had somehow expected whoever was the tall priest there could be no doubt about the identity of the short one it was his friend of the harwich train the stumpy little cure of essex whom he had warned about his brown paper parcels now so far as this went everything fitted in finally and rationally enough valentin had learned by his inquiries that morning that a father brown from essex was bringing up a silver cross with sapphires a relic of considerable value to show some of the foreign priests at the congress this undoubtedly was the silver with blue stones and father brown undoubtedly was the little greenhorn in the train now there was nothing wonderful about the fact that what valentin had found out flambeau had also found out flambeau found out everything also there was nothing wonderful in the fact that when flambeau heard of a sapphire cross he should try to steal it that was the most natural thing in all natural history and most certainly there was nothing wonderful about the fact that flambeau should have it all his own way with such a silly sheep as the man with the umbrella and the parcels he was the sort of man whom anybody could lead on a string to the north pole it was not surprising that an actor like flambeau dressed as another priest could lead him to hampstead heath so far the crime seemed clear enough and while the detective pitied the priest for his helplessness he almost despised flambeau for condescending to so gullible a victim but when valentin thought of all that had happened in between of all that had led him to his triumph he racked his brains for the smallest rhyme or reason in it what had the stealing of a blue and silver cross from a priest from essex to do with chucking soup at wall paper what had it to do with calling nuts oranges or with paying for windows first and breaking them afterwards he had come to the end of his chase yet somehow he had missed the middle of it when he failed which was seldom he had usually grasped the clue but nevertheless missed the criminal here he had grasped the criminal but still he could not grasp the clue the two figures that they followed were crawling like black flies across the huge green contour of a hill they were evidently sunk in conversation and perhaps did not notice where they were going but they were certainly going to the wilder and more silent heights of the heath as their pursuers gained on them the latter had to use the undignified attitudes of the deer stalker to crouch behind clumps of trees and even to crawl prostrate in deep grass by these ungainly ingenuities the hunters even came close enough to the quarry to hear the murmur of the discussion but no word could be distinguished except the word reason recurring frequently in a high and almost childish voice once over an abrupt dip of land and a dense tangle of thickets the detectives actually lost the two figures they were following they did not find the trail again for an agonising ten minutes and then it led round the brow of a great dome of hill overlooking an amphitheatre of rich and desolate sunset scenery under a tree in this commanding yet neglected spot was an old ramshackle wooden seat on this seat sat the two priests still in serious speech together the gorgeous green and gold still clung to the darkening horizon but the dome above was turning slowly from peacock green to peacock blue and the stars detached themselves more and more like solid jewels mutely motioning to his followers valentin contrived to creep up behind the big branching tree and standing there in deathly silence heard the words of the strange priests for the first time after he had listened for a minute and a half he was gripped by a devilish doubt perhaps he had dragged the two english policemen to the wastes of a nocturnal heath on an errand no saner than seeking figs on its thistles for the two priests were talking exactly like priests piously with learning and leisure about the most aerial enigmas of theology the little essex priest spoke the more simply with his round face turned to the strengthening stars the other talked with his head bowed as if he were not even worthy to look at them but no more innocently clerical conversation could have been heard in any white italian cloister or black spanish cathedral the first he heard was the tail of one of father brown's sentences which ended what they really meant in the middle ages by the heavens being incorruptible the taller priest nodded his bowed head and said ah yes these modern infidels appeal to their reason but who can look at those millions of worlds and not feel that there may well be wonderful universes above us where reason is utterly unreasonable no said the other priest reason is always reasonable even in the last limbo in the lost borderland of things i know that people charge the church with lowering reason but it is just the other way alone on earth the church makes reason really supreme alone on earth the church affirms that god himself is bound by reason the other priest raised his austere face to the spangled sky and said yet who knows if in that infinite universe only infinite physically said the little priest turning sharply in his seat not infinite in the sense of escaping from the laws of truth valentin behind his tree was tearing his fingernails with silent fury he seemed almost to hear the sniggers of the english detectives whom he had brought so far on a fantastic guess only to listen to the metaphysical gossip of two mild old parsons in his impatience he lost the equally elaborate answer of the tall cleric and when he listened again it was again father brown who was speaking reason and justice grip the remotest and the loneliest star look at those stars don't they look as if they were single diamonds and sapphires well you can imagine any mad botany or geology you please think of forests of adamant with leaves of brilliants think the moon is a blue moon a single elephantine sapphire but don't fancy that all that frantic astronomy would make the smallest difference to the reason and justice of conduct on plains of opal under cliffs cut out of pearl you would still find a notice board thou shalt not steal valentin was just in the act of rising from his rigid and crouching attitude and creeping away as softly as might be felled by the one great folly of his life but something in the very silence of the tall priest made him stop until the latter spoke when at last he did speak he said simply his head bowed and his hands on his knees well i think that other worlds may perhaps rise higher than our reason the mystery of heaven is unfathomable and i for one can only bow my head then with brow yet bent and without changing by the faintest shade his attitude or voice he added just hand over that sapphire cross of yours will you we're all alone here and i could pull you to pieces like a straw doll the utterly unaltered voice and attitude added a strange violence to that shocking change of speech but the guarder of the relic only seemed to turn his head by the smallest section of the compass he seemed still to have a somewhat foolish face turned to the stars perhaps he had not understood or perhaps he had understood and sat rigid with terror yes said the tall priest in the same low voice and in the same still posture yes i am flambeau then after a pause he said come will you give me that cross no said the other and the monosyllable had an odd sound flambeau suddenly flung off all his pontifical pretensions the great robber leaned back in his seat and laughed low but long no he cried you won't give it me you proud prelate you won't give it me you little celibate simpleton shall i tell you why you won't give it me because i've got it already in my own breast pocket the small man from essex turned what seemed to be a dazed face in the dusk and said with the timid eagerness of the private secretary are are you sure flambeau yelled with delight really you're as good as a three act farce he cried yes you turnip i am quite sure i had the sense to make a duplicate of the right parcel and now my friend you've got the duplicate and i've got the jewels an old dodge father brown a very old dodge yes said father brown and passed his hand through his hair with the same strange vagueness of manner yes i've heard of it before the colossus of crime leaned over to the little rustic priest with a sort of sudden interest you have heard of it he asked where have you heard of it well i mustn't tell you his name of course said the little man simply he was a penitent you know he had lived prosperously for about twenty years entirely on duplicate brown paper parcels and so you see when i began to suspect you i thought of this poor chap's way of doing it at once began to suspect me repeated the outlaw with increased intensity did you really have the gumption to suspect me just because i brought you up to this bare part of the heath no no said brown with an air of apology you see i suspected you when we first met it's that little bulge up the sleeve where you people have the spiked bracelet how in tartarus cried flambeau did you ever hear of the spiked bracelet oh one's little flock you know said father brown arching his eyebrows rather blankly when i was a curate in hartlepool there were three of them with spiked bracelets so as i suspected you from the first don't you see i made sure that the cross should go safe anyhow i'm afraid i watched you you know so at last i saw you change the parcels then don't you see i changed them back again and then i left the right one behind left it behind repeated flambeau and for the first time there was another note in his voice beside his triumph well it was like this said the little priest speaking in the same unaffected way i went back to that sweet shop and asked if i'd left a parcel and gave them a particular address if it turned up well i knew i hadn't but when i went away again i did so instead of running after me with that valuable parcel they have sent it flying to a friend of mine in westminster then he added rather sadly i learnt that too from a poor fellow in hartlepool he used to do it with handbags he stole at railway stations but he's in a monastery now oh one gets to know you know he added rubbing his head again with the same sort of desperate apology we can't help being priests people come and tell us these things flambeau tore a brown paper parcel out of his inner pocket and rent it in pieces there was nothing but paper and sticks of lead inside it he sprang to his feet with a gigantic gesture and cried i don't believe you i don't believe a bumpkin like you could manage all that i believe you've still got the stuff on you and if you don't give it up why we're all alone and i'll take it by force no said father brown simply and stood up also you won't take it by force first because i really haven't still got it and second because we are not alone flambeau stopped in his stride forward behind that tree said father brown pointing are two strong policemen and the greatest detective alive how did they come here do you ask why i brought them of course how did i do it why i'll tell you if you like lord bless you we have to know twenty such things when we work among the criminal classes well i wasn't sure you were a thief and it would never do to make a scandal against one of our own clergy so i just tested you to see if anything would make you show yourself a man generally makes a small scene if he finds salt in his coffee if he doesn't he has some reason for keeping quiet i changed the salt and sugar and you kept quiet a man generally objects if his bill is three times too big if he pays it he has some motive for passing unnoticed i altered your bill and you paid it the world seemed waiting for flambeau to leap like a tiger but he was held back as by a spell he was stunned with the utmost curiosity well went on father brown with lumbering lucidity as you wouldn't leave any tracks for the police of course somebody had to at every place we went to i took care to do something that would get us talked about for the rest of the day i didn't do much harm a splashed wall spilt apples a broken window but i saved the cross as the cross will always be saved it is at westminster by now i rather wonder you didn't stop it with the donkey's whistle with the what asked flambeau i'm glad you've never heard of it said the priest making a face it's a foul thing i'm sure you're too good a man for a whistler i couldn't have countered it even with the spots myself i'm not strong enough in the legs what on earth are you talking about asked the other well i did think you'd know the spots said father brown agreeably surprised oh you can't have gone so very wrong yet how in blazes do you know all these horrors cried flambeau the shadow of a smile crossed the round simple face of his clerical opponent oh by being a celibate simpleton i suppose he said has it never struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men's real sins is not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil but as a matter of fact another part of my trade too made me sure you weren't a priest what asked the thief almost gaping you attacked reason said father brown it's bad theology and even as he turned away to collect his property the three policemen came out from under the twilight trees flambeau was an artist and a sportsman he stepped back and swept valentin a great bow do not bow to me mon ami said valentin with silver clearness let us both bow to our master and they both stood an instant uncovered while the little essex priest blinked about for his umbrella the secret garden aristide valentin chief of the paris police was late for his dinner and some of his guests began to arrive before him these were however reassured by his confidential servant ivan the old man with a scar and a face almost as grey as his moustaches who always sat at a table in the entrance hall a hall hung with weapons valentin's house was perhaps as peculiar and celebrated as its master it was an old house with high walls and tall poplars almost overhanging the seine but the oddity and perhaps the police value of its architecture was this that there was no ultimate exit at all except through this front door which was guarded by ivan and the armoury the garden was large and elaborate and there were many exits from the house into the garden but there was no exit from the garden into the world outside all round it ran a tall smooth unscalable wall with special spikes at the top no bad garden perhaps for a man to reflect in whom some hundred criminals had sworn to kill as ivan explained to the guests their host had telephoned that he was detained for ten minutes he was in truth making some last arrangements about executions and such ugly things and though these duties were rootedly repulsive to him he always performed them with precision ruthless in the pursuit of criminals he was very mild about their punishment since he had been supreme over french and largely over european policial methods his great influence had been honourably used for the mitigation of sentences and the purification of prisons he was one of the great humanitarian french freethinkers and the only thing wrong with them is that they make mercy even colder than justice when valentin arrived he was already dressed in black clothes and the red rosette an elegant figure his dark beard already streaked with grey he went straight through his house to his study which opened on the grounds behind the garden door of it was open and after he had carefully locked his box in its official place he stood for a few seconds at the open door looking out upon the garden a sharp moon was fighting with the flying rags and tatters of a storm and valentin regarded it with a wistfulness unusual in such scientific natures as his perhaps such scientific natures have some psychic prevision of the most tremendous problem of their lives from any such occult mood at least he quickly recovered for he knew he was late and that his guests had already begun to arrive a glance at his drawing room when he entered it was enough to make certain that his principal guest was not there at any rate he saw all the other pillars of the little party he saw lord galloway the english ambassador a choleric old man with a russet face like an apple wearing the blue ribbon of the garter he saw lady galloway slim and threadlike with silver hair and a face sensitive and superior he saw her daughter lady margaret graham a pale and pretty girl with an elfish face and copper coloured hair he saw the duchess of mont st michel black eyed and opulent and with her her two daughters black eyed and opulent also he saw dr simon a typical french scientist with glasses a pointed brown beard and a forehead barred with those parallel wrinkles which are the penalty of superciliousness since they come through constantly elevating the eyebrows he saw father brown of cobhole in essex whom he had recently met in england he saw perhaps with more interest than any of these a tall man in uniform who had bowed to the galloways without receiving any very hearty acknowledgment and who now advanced alone to pay his respects to his host this was commandant o'brien of the french foreign legion he was a slim yet somewhat swaggering figure clean shaven dark haired and blue eyed and as seemed natural in an officer of that famous regiment of victorious failures and successful suicides he had an air at once dashing and melancholy he was by birth an irish gentleman and in boyhood had known the galloways especially margaret graham he had left his country after some crash of debts and now expressed his complete freedom from british etiquette by swinging about in uniform sabre and spurs when he bowed to the ambassador's family lord and lady galloway bent stiffly and lady margaret looked away but for whatever old causes such people might be interested in each other their distinguished host was not specially interested in them no one of them at least was in his eyes the guest of the evening valentin was expecting for special reasons a man of world wide fame whose friendship he had secured during some of his great detective tours and triumphs in the united states he was expecting julius k brayne that multi millionaire whose colossal and even crushing endowments of small religions have occasioned so much easy sport and easier solemnity for the american and english papers nobody could quite make out whether mr brayne was an atheist or a mormon or a christian scientist but he was ready to pour money into any intellectual vessel so long as it was an untried vessel one of his hobbies was to wait for the american shakespeare a hobby more patient than angling he admired walt whitman but thought that luke p tanner of paris pa was more progressive than whitman any day he liked anything that he thought progressive he thought valentin progressive thereby doing him a grave injustice the solid appearance of julius k brayne in the room was as decisive as a dinner bell he had this great quality which very few of us can claim that his presence was as big as his absence he was a huge fellow as fat as he was tall clad in complete evening black without so much relief as a watch chain or a ring his hair was white and well brushed back like a german's his face was red fierce and cherubic with one dark tuft under the lower lip that threw up that otherwise infantile visage with an effect theatrical and even mephistophelean not long however did that salon merely stare at the celebrated american his lateness had already become a domestic problem and he was sent with all speed into the dining room with lady galloway on his arm except on one point the galloways were genial and casual enough so long as lady margaret did not take the arm of that adventurer o'brien her father was quite satisfied and she had not done so she had decorously gone in with dr simon nevertheless old lord galloway was restless and almost rude he was diplomatic enough during dinner but when over the cigars three of the younger men simon the doctor brown the priest and the detrimental o'brien the exile in a foreign uniform all melted away to mix with the ladies or smoke in the conservatory then the english diplomatist grew very undiplomatic indeed he was stung every sixty seconds with the thought that the scamp o'brien might be signalling to margaret somehow he did not attempt to imagine how he was left over the coffee with brayne the hoary yankee who believed in all religions and valentin the grizzled frenchman who believed in none they could argue with each other but neither could appeal to him after a time this progressive logomachy had reached a crisis of tedium lord galloway got up also and sought the drawing room he lost his way in long passages for some six or eight minutes till he heard the high pitched didactic voice of the doctor and then the dull voice of the priest followed by general laughter they also he thought with a curse were probably arguing about science and religion but the instant he opened the salon door he saw only one thing he saw what was not there he saw that commandant o'brien was absent and that lady margaret was absent too rising impatiently from the drawing room as he had from the dining room he stamped along the passage once more his notion of protecting his daughter from the irish algerian n'er do well had become something central and even mad in his mind as he went towards the back of the house where was valentin's study he was surprised to meet his daughter who swept past with a white scornful face which was a second enigma if she had been with o'brien where was o'brien if she had not been with o'brien where had she been with a sort of senile and passionate suspicion he groped his way to the dark back parts of the mansion and eventually found a servants entrance that opened on to the garden the moon with her scimitar had now ripped up and rolled away all the storm wrack the argent light lit up all four corners of the garden a tall figure in blue was striding across the lawn towards the study door a glint of moonlit silver on his facings picked him out as commandant o'brien he vanished through the french windows into the house leaving lord galloway in an indescribable temper at once virulent and vague the blue and silver garden like a scene in a theatre seemed to taunt him with all that tyrannic tenderness against which his worldly authority was at war the length and grace of the irishman's stride enraged him as if he were a rival instead of a father the moonlight maddened him he was trapped as if by magic into a garden of troubadours a watteau fairyland and willing to shake off such amorous imbecilities by speech he stepped briskly after his enemy as he did so he tripped over some tree or stone in the grass looked down at it first with irritation and then a second time with curiosity the next instant the moon and the tall poplars looked at an unusual sight an elderly english diplomatist running hard and crying or bellowing as he ran his hoarse shouts brought a pale face to the study door the beaming glasses and worried brow of dr simon who heard the nobleman's first clear words lord galloway was crying a corpse in the grass a blood stained corpse o'brien at last had gone utterly out of his mind we must tell valentin at once said the doctor when the other had brokenly described all that he had dared to examine it is fortunate that he is here and even as he spoke the great detective entered the study attracted by the cry it was almost amusing to note his typical transformation he had come with the common concern of a host and a gentleman fearing that some guest or servant was ill when he was told the gory fact he turned with all his gravity instantly bright and businesslike for this however abrupt and awful was his business strange gentlemen he said as they hurried out into the garden that i should have hunted mysteries all over the earth and now one comes and settles in my own back yard but where is the place they crossed the lawn less easily as a slight mist had begun to rise from the river but under the guidance of the shaken galloway they found the body sunken in deep grass the body of a very tall and broad shouldered man he lay face downwards so they could only see that his big shoulders were clad in black cloth and that his big head was bald except for a wisp or two of brown hair that clung to his skull like wet seaweed a scarlet serpent of blood crawled from under his fallen face at least said simon with a deep and singular intonation he is none of our party examine him doctor cried valentin rather sharply he may not be dead the doctor bent down he is not quite cold but i am afraid he is dead enough he answered just help me to lift him up they lifted him carefully an inch from the ground and all doubts as to his being really dead were settled at once and frightfully the head fell away it had been entirely sundered from the body whoever had cut his throat had managed to sever the neck as well even valentin was slightly shocked he must have been as strong as a gorilla he muttered not without a shiver though he was used to anatomical abortions dr simon lifted the head it was slightly slashed about the neck and jaw but the face was substantially unhurt it was a ponderous yellow face at once sunken and swollen with a hawk like nose and heavy lids a face of a wicked roman emperor with perhaps a distant touch of a chinese emperor all present seemed to look at it with the coldest eye of ignorance nothing else could be noted about the man except that as they had lifted his body they had seen underneath it the white gleam of a shirt front defaced with a red gleam of blood as dr simon said the man had never been of their party but he might very well have been trying to join it for he had come dressed for such an occasion valentin went down on his hands and knees and examined with his closest professional attention the grass and ground for some twenty yards round the body in which he was assisted less skillfully by the doctor and quite vaguely by the english lord nothing rewarded their grovellings except a few twigs snapped or chopped into very small lengths which valentin lifted for an instant's examination and then tossed away twigs he said gravely twigs and a total stranger with his head cut off that is all there is on this lawn there was an almost creepy stillness and then the unnerved galloway called out sharply who's that who's that over there by the garden wall a small figure with a foolishly large head drew waveringly near them in the moonlit haze looked for an instant like a goblin but turned out to be the harmless little priest whom they had left in the drawing room i say he said"
