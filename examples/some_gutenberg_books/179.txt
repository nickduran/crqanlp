"1" "awkward her hair was fair and perfectly straight her eyes were dark and they had the singularity of seeming at once dull and restless differing herein as you see fatally from the ideal fine eyes which we always imagine to be both brilliant and tranquil the doors and windows of the large square house were all wide open to admit the purifying sunshine which lay in generous patches upon the floor of a wide high covered piazza adjusted to two sides of the mansion a piazza on which several straw bottomed rocking chairs and half a dozen of those small cylindrical stools in green and blue porcelain which suggest an affiliation between the residents and the eastern trade were symmetrically disposed it was an ancient house ancient in the sense of being eighty years old it was built of wood painted a clean clear faded gray and adorned along the front at intervals with flat wooden pilasters painted white these pilasters appeared to support a kind of classic pediment which was decorated in the middle by a large triple window in a boldly carved frame and in each of its smaller angles by a glazed circular aperture a large white door furnished with a highly polished brass knocker presented itself to the rural looking road with which it was connected by a spacious pathway paved with worn and cracked but very clean bricks behind it there were meadows and orchards a barn and a pond and facing it a short distance along the road on the opposite side stood a smaller house painted white with external shutters painted green a little garden on one hand and an orchard on the other all this was shining in the morning air through which the simple details of the picture addressed themselves to the eye as distinctly as the items of a sum in addition a second young lady presently came out of the house across the piazza descended into the garden and approached the young girl of whom i have spoken this second young lady was also thin and pale but she was older than the other she was shorter she had dark smooth hair her eyes unlike the other's were quick and bright but they were not at all restless she wore a straw bonnet with white ribbons and a long red india scarf which on the front of her dress reached to her feet in her hand she carried a little key gertrude she said are you very sure you had better not go to church gertrude looked at her a moment plucked a small sprig from a lilac bush smelled it and threw it away i am not very sure of anything she answered the other young lady looked straight past her at the distant pond which lay shining between the long banks of fir trees then she said in a very soft voice this is the key of the dining room closet i think you had better have it if any one should want anything who is there to want anything gertrude demanded i shall be all alone in the house some one may come said her companion do you mean mr brand yes gertrude he may like a piece of cake i don't like men that are always eating cake gertrude declared giving a pull at the lilac bush her companion glanced at her and then looked down on the ground i think father expected you would come to church she said what shall i say to him say i have a bad headache would that be true asked the elder lady looking straight at the pond again no charlotte said the younger one simply charlotte transferred her quiet eyes to her companion's face i am afraid you are feeling restless i am feeling as i always feel gertrude replied in the same tone charlotte turned away but she stood there a moment presently she looked down at the front of her dress does n't it seem to you somehow as if my scarf were too long she asked gertrude walked half round her looking at the scarf i don't think you wear it right she said how should i wear it dear i don't know differently from that you should draw it differently over your shoulders round your elbows you should look differently behind how should i look charlotte inquired i don't think i can tell you said gertrude plucking out the scarf a little behind i could do it myself but i don't think i can explain it charlotte by a movement of her elbows corrected the laxity that had come from her companion's touch well some day you must do it for me it does n't matter now indeed i don't think it matters she added how one looks behind i should say it mattered more said gertrude then you don't know who may be observing you you are not on your guard you can't try to look pretty charlotte received this declaration with extreme gravity i don't think one should ever try to look pretty she rejoined earnestly her companion was silent then she said well perhaps it s not of much use charlotte looked at her a little and then kissed her i hope you will be better when we come back my dear sister i am very well said gertrude charlotte went down the large brick walk to the garden gate her companion strolled slowly toward the house at the gate charlotte met a young man who was coming in a tall fair young man wearing a high hat and a pair of thread gloves he was handsome but rather too stout he had a pleasant smile oh mr brand exclaimed the young lady i came to see whether your sister was not going to church said the young man she says she is not going but i am very glad you have come i think if you were to talk to her a little and charlotte lowered her voice it seems as if she were restless mr brand smiled down on the young lady from his great height i shall be very glad to talk to her for that i should be willing to absent myself from almost any occasion of worship however attractive well i suppose you know said charlotte softly as if positive acceptance of this proposition might be dangerous but i am afraid i shall be late i hope you will have a pleasant sermon said the young man oh mr gilman is always pleasant charlotte answered and she went on her way mr brand went into the garden where gertrude hearing the gate close behind him turned and looked at him for a moment she watched him coming then she turned away but almost immediately she corrected this movement and stood still facing him he took off his hat and wiped his forehead as he approached then he put on his hat again and held out his hand his hat being removed you would have perceived that his forehead was very large and smooth and his hair abundant but rather colorless his nose was too large and his mouth and eyes were too small but for all this he was as i have said a young man of striking appearance the expression of his little clean colored blue eyes was irresistibly gentle and serious he looked as the phrase is as good as gold the young girl standing in the garden path glanced as he came up at his thread gloves i hoped you were going to church he said i wanted to walk with you i am very much obliged to you gertrude answered i am not going to church she had shaken hands with him he held her hand a moment have you any special reason for not going yes mr brand said the young girl may i ask what it is she looked at him smiling and in her smile as i have intimated there was a certain dullness but mingled with this dullness was something sweet and suggestive because the sky is so blue she said he looked at the sky which was magnificent and then said smiling too i have heard of young ladies staying at home for bad weather but never for good your sister whom i met at the gate tells me you are depressed he added depressed i am never depressed oh surely sometimes replied mr brand as if he thought this a regrettable account of one's self i am never depressed gertrude repeated but i am sometimes wicked when i am wicked i am in high spirits i was wicked just now to my sister what did you do to her i said things that puzzled her on purpose why did you do that miss gertrude asked the young man she began to smile again because the sky is so blue you say things that puzzle me mr brand declared i always know when i do it proceeded gertrude but people puzzle me more i think and they don't seem to know this is very interesting mr brand observed smiling you told me to tell you about my my struggles the young girl went on let us talk about them i have so many things to say gertrude turned away a moment and then turning back you had better go to church she said you know the young man urged that i have always one thing to say gertrude looked at him a moment please don't say it now we are all alone he continued taking off his hat all alone in this beautiful sunday stillness gertrude looked around her at the breaking buds the shining distance the blue sky to which she had referred as a pretext for her irregularities that s the reason she said why i don't want you to speak do me a favor go to church may i speak when i come back asked mr brand if you are still disposed she answered i don't know whether you are wicked he said but you are certainly puzzling she had turned away she raised her hands to her ears he looked at her a moment and then he slowly walked to church she wandered for a while about the garden vaguely and without purpose the church bell had stopped ringing the stillness was complete this young lady relished highly on occasions the sense of being alone the absence of the whole family and the emptiness of the house to day apparently the servants had also gone to church there was never a figure at the open windows behind the house there was no stout negress in a red turban lowering the bucket into the great shingle hooded well and the front door of the big unguarded home stood open with the trustfulness of the golden age or what is more to the purpose with that of new england's silvery prime gertrude slowly passed through it and went from one of the empty rooms to the other large clear colored rooms with white wainscots ornamented with thin legged mahogany furniture and on the walls with old fashioned engravings chiefly of scriptural subjects hung very high this agreeable sense of solitude of having the house to herself of which i have spoken always excited gertrude's imagination she could not have told you why and neither can her humble historian it always seemed to her that she must do something particular that she must honor the occasion and while she roamed about wondering what she could do the occasion usually came to an end to day she wondered more than ever at last she took down a book there was no library in the house but there were books in all the rooms none of them were forbidden books and gertrude had not stopped at home for the sake of a chance to climb to the inaccessible shelves she possessed herself of a very obvious volume one of the series of the arabian nights and she brought it out into the portico and sat down with it in her lap there for a quarter of an hour she read the history of the loves of the prince camaralzaman and the princess badoura at last looking up she beheld as it seemed to her the prince camaralzaman standing before her a beautiful young man was making her a very low bow a magnificent bow such as she had never seen before he appeared to have dropped from the clouds he was wonderfully handsome he smiled smiled as if he were smiling on purpose extreme surprise for a moment kept gertrude sitting still then she rose without even keeping her finger in her book the young man with his hat in his hand still looked at her smiling and smiling it was very strange will you kindly tell me said the mysterious visitor at last whether i have the honor of speaking to miss went worth my name is gertrude wentworth murmured the young woman then then i have the honor the pleasure of being your cousin the young man had so much the character of an apparition that this announcement seemed to complete his unreality what cousin who are you said gertrude he stepped back a few paces and looked up at the house then glanced round him at the garden and the distant view after this he burst out laughing i see it must seem to you very strange he said there was after all something substantial in his laughter gertrude looked at him from head to foot yes he was remarkably handsome but his smile was almost a grimace it is very still he went on coming nearer again and as she only looked at him for reply he added are you all alone every one has gone to church said gertrude i was afraid of that the young man exclaimed but i hope you are not afraid of me you ought to tell me who you are gertrude answered i am afraid of you said the young man i had a different plan i expected the servant would take in my card and that you would put your heads together before admitting me and make out my identity gertrude had been wondering with a quick intensity which brought its result and the result seemed an answer a wondrous delightful answer to her vague wish that something would befall her i know i know she said you come from europe we came two days ago you have heard of us then you believe in us we have known vaguely said gertrude that we had relations in france and have you ever wanted to see us asked the young man gertrude was silent a moment i have wanted to see you i am glad then it is you i have found we wanted to see you so we came on purpose asked gertrude the young man looked round him smiling still well yes on purpose does that sound as if we should bore you he added i don't think we shall i really don't think we shall we are rather fond of wandering too and we were glad of a pretext and you have just arrived in boston two days ago at the inn i asked for mr wentworth he must be your father they found out for me where he lived they seemed often to have heard of him i determined to come without ceremony so this lovely morning they set my face in the right direction and told me to walk straight before me out of town i came on foot because i wanted to see the country i walked and walked and here i am it s a good many miles it is seven miles and a half said gertrude softly now that this handsome young man was proving himself a reality she found herself vaguely trembling she was deeply excited she had never in her life spoken to a foreigner and she had often thought it would be delightful to do so here was one who had suddenly been engendered by the sabbath stillness for her private use and such a brilliant polite smiling one she found time and means to compose herself however to remind herself that she must exercise a sort of official hospitality we are very very glad to see you she said won't you come into the house and she moved toward the open door you are not afraid of me then asked the young man again with his light laugh she wondered a moment and then we are not afraid here she said ah comme vous devez avoir raison cried the young man looking all round him appreciatively it was the first time that gertrude had heard so many words of french spoken they gave her something of a sensation her companion followed her watching with a certain excitement of his own this tall interesting looking girl dressed in her clear crisp muslin he paused in the hall where there was a broad white staircase with a white balustrade what a pleasant house he said it s lighter inside than it is out it s pleasanter here said gertrude and she led the way into the parlor a high clean rather empty looking room here they stood looking at each other the young man smiling more than ever gertrude very serious trying to smile i don't believe you know my name he said i am called felix young your father is my uncle my mother was his half sister and older than he yes said gertrude and she turned roman catholic and married in europe i see you know said the young man she married and she died your father's family did n't like her husband they called him a foreigner but he was not my poor father was born in sicily but his parents were american in sicily gertrude murmured it is true said felix young that they had spent their lives in europe but they were very patriotic and so are we and you are sicilian said gertrude sicilian no let s see i was born at a little place a dear little place in france my sister was born at vienna so you are french said gertrude heaven forbid cried the young man gertrude's eyes were fixed upon him almost insistently he began to laugh again i can easily be french if that will please you you are a foreigner of some sort said gertrude of some sort yes i suppose so but who can say of what sort i don't think we have ever had occasion to settle the question you know there are people like that about their country their religion their profession they can't tell gertrude stood there gazing she had not asked him to sit down she had never heard of people like that she wanted to hear where do you live she asked they can't tell that either said felix i am afraid you will think they are little better than vagabonds i have lived anywhere everywhere i really think i have lived in every city in europe gertrude gave a little long soft exhalation it made the young man smile at her again and his smile made her blush a little to take refuge from blushing she asked him if after his long walk he was not hungry or thirsty her hand was in her pocket she was fumbling with the little key that her sister had given her ah my dear young lady he said clasping his hands a little if you could give me in charity a glass of wine gertrude gave a smile and a little nod and went quickly out of the room presently she came back with a very large decanter in one hand and a plate in the other on which was placed a big round cake with a frosted top gertrude in taking the cake from the closet had had a moment of acute consciousness that it composed the refection of which her sister had thought that mr brand would like to partake her kinsman from across the seas was looking at the pale high hung engravings when she came in he turned and smiled at her as if they had been old friends meeting after a separation you wait upon me yourself he asked i am served like the gods she had waited upon a great many people but none of them had ever told her that the observation added a certain lightness to the step with which she went to a little table where there were some curious red glasses glasses covered with little gold sprigs which charlotte used to dust every morning with her own hands gertrude thought the glasses very handsome and it was a pleasure to her to know that the wine was good it was her father's famous madeira felix young thought it excellent he wondered why he had been told that there was no wine in america she cut him an immense triangle out of the cake and again she thought of mr brand felix sat there with his glass in one hand and his huge morsel of cake in the other eating drinking smiling talking i am very hungry he said i am not at all tired i am never tired but i am very hungry you must stay to dinner said gertrude at two o'clock they will all have come back from church you will see the others who are the others asked the young man describe them all you will see for yourself it is you that must tell me now about your sister my sister is the baroness munster said felix on hearing that his sister was a baroness gertrude got up and walked about slowly in front of him she was silent a moment she was thinking of it why did n't she come too she asked she did come she is in boston at the hotel we will go and see her said gertrude looking at him she begs you will not the young man replied she sends you her love she sent me to announce her she will come and pay her respects to your father gertrude felt herself trembling again a baroness munster who sent a brilliant young man to announce her who was coming as the queen of sheba came to solomon to pay her respects to quiet mr wentworth such a personage presented herself to gertrude's vision with a most effective unexpectedness for a moment she hardly knew what to say when will she come she asked at last as soon as you will allow her to morrow she is very impatient answered felix who wished to be agreeable to morrow yes said gertrude she wished to ask more about her but she hardly knew what could be predicated of a baroness munster is she is she married felix had finished his cake and wine he got up fixing upon the young girl his bright expressive eyes she is married to a german prince prince adolf of silberstadt schreckenstein he is not the reigning prince he is a younger brother gertrude gazed at her informant her lips were slightly parted is she a a princess she asked at last oh no said the young man her position is rather a singular one it s a morganatic marriage morganatic these were new names and new words to poor gertrude that s what they call a marriage you know contracted between a scion of a ruling house and and a common mortal they made eugenia a baroness poor woman but that was all they could do now they want to dissolve the marriage prince adolf between ourselves is a ninny but his brother who is a clever man has plans for him eugenia naturally enough makes difficulties not however that i think she cares much she s a very clever woman i m sure you ll like her but she wants to bother them just now everything is en l'air the cheerful off hand tone in which her visitor related this darkly romantic tale seemed to gertrude very strange but it seemed also to convey a certain flattery to herself a recognition of her wisdom and dignity she felt a dozen impressions stirring within her and presently the one that was uppermost found words they want to dissolve her marriage she asked so it appears and against her will against her right she must be very unhappy said gertrude her visitor looked at her smiling he raised his hand to the back of his head and held it there a moment so she says he answered that s her story she told me to tell it you tell me more said gertrude no i will leave that to her she does it better gertrude gave her little excited sigh again well if she is unhappy she said i am glad she has come to us she had been so interested that she failed to notice the sound of a footstep in the portico and yet it was a footstep that she always recognized she heard it in the hall and then she looked out of the window they were all coming back from church her father her sister and brother and their cousins who always came to dinner on sunday mr brand had come in first he was in advance of the others because apparently he was still disposed to say what she had not wished him to say an hour before he came into the parlor looking for gertrude he had two little books in his hand on seeing gertrude's companion he slowly stopped looking at him is this a cousin asked felix then gertrude saw that she must introduce him but her ears and by sympathy her lips were full of all that he had been telling her this is the prince she said the prince of silberstadt schreckenstein felix burst out laughing and mr brand stood staring while the others who had passed into the house appeared behind him in the open door way chapter iii that evening at dinner felix young gave his sister the baroness munster an account of his impressions she saw that he had come back in the highest possible spirits but this fact to her own mind was not a reason for rejoicing she had but a limited confidence in her brother's judgment his capacity for taking rose colored views was such as to vulgarize one of the prettiest of tints still she supposed he could be trusted to give her the mere facts and she invited him with some eagerness to communicate them i suppose at least they did n't turn you out from the door she said you have been away some ten hours turn me from the door felix exclaimed they took me to their hearts they killed the fatted calf i know what you want to say they are a collection of angels exactly said felix they are a collection of angels simply c'est bien vague remarked the baroness what are they like like nothing you ever saw i am sure i am much obliged but that is hardly more definite seriously they were glad to see you enchanted it has been the proudest day of my life never never have i been so lionized i assure you i was cock of the walk my dear sister said the young man nous n'avons qu'a nous tenir we shall be great swells madame munster looked at him and her eye exhibited a slight responsive spark she touched her lips to a glass of wine and then she said describe them give me a picture felix drained his own glass well it s in the country among the meadows and woods a wild sort of place and yet not far from here only such a road my dear imagine one of the alpine glaciers reproduced in mud but you will not spend much time on it for they want you to come and stay once for all ah said the baroness they want me to come and stay once for all bon it s intensely rural tremendously natural and all overhung with this strange white light this far away blue sky there s a big wooden house a kind of three story bungalow it looks like a magnified nuremberg toy there was a gentleman there that made a speech to me about it and called it a venerable mansion but it looks as if it had been built last night is it handsome is it elegant asked the baroness felix looked at her a moment smiling it s very clean no splendors no gilding no troops of servants rather straight backed chairs but you might eat off the floors and you can sit down on the stairs that must be a privilege and the inhabitants are straight backed too of course my dear sister said felix the inhabitants are charming in what style in a style of their own how shall i describe it it s primitive it s patriarchal it s the ton of the golden age and have they nothing golden but their ton are there no symptoms of wealth i should say there was wealth without symptoms a plain homely way of life nothing for show and very little for what shall i call it for the senses but a great faisance and a lot of money out of sight that comes forward very quietly for subscriptions to institutions for repairing tenements for paying doctor's bills perhaps even for portioning daughters and the daughters madame munster demanded how many are there there are two charlotte and gertrude are they pretty one of them said"
