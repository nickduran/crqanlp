"1" "thorpe tentatively in a muffled voice the practical woman reflected for an instant i was thinking she confessed then that it might be cheaper to leave your things there and buy what little you want i don't imagine from what i've seen that your wardrobe is so very valuable but no i suppose the bill ought to be paid perhaps it can be managed how much will it be thorpe musingly rose to his feet and strolled over to her chair with his thick hands on his sister's shoulders he stooped and kissed her on the forehead you believe in me now anyway eh lou he said as he straightened himself behind her the unaccustomed caress so different in character from the perfunctory salute with which he had greeted her on his arrival from foreign parts six months before brought a flush of pleased surprise to her plain face then a kind of bewilderment crept into the abstracted gaze she was bending upon the fireless grate something extraordinary unaccountable was in the manner of her brother she recalled that in truth he was more than half a stranger to her how could she tell what wild uncanny second nature had not grown up in him under those outlandish tropical skies he had just told her that his ruin was absolute overwhelming yet there had been a covert smile in the recesses of his glance even now she half felt half heard a chuckle from him there as he stood behind her the swift thought that disaster had shaken his brain loomed up and possessed her she flung herself out of the chair and wheeling seized its back and drew it between them as she faced him it was with a stare of frank dismay that she beheld him grinning at her what she began stammering what is the matter joel he permitted himself the luxury of smiling blankly at her for a further moment then he tossed his head and laughed abruptly sit down old girl he adjured her try and hold yourself together now to hear some different kind of news i've been playing it rather low down on you for a fact instead of my being smashed it's the other way about she continued to confront him with a nervous clasp upon the chair back her breathing troubled her as she regarded him and tried to take in the meaning of his words do you mean you've been lying to me about about your company she asked confusedly no no not at all he replied now all genial heartiness no what i told you was gospel truth but i was taking a rise out of you all the same he seemed so unaffectedly pleased by his achievement in kindly duplicity that she forced an awkward smile to her lips i don't understand in the least she said striving to remember what he had told her what you said was that the public had entirely failed to come in that there weren't enough applications for shares to pay flotation expenses those were your own words of course i don't pretend to understand these city matters but it is the case isn't it that if people don't subscribe for the shares of a new company then the company is a failure yes that may be said to be the case as a general rule he nodded at her still beaming well then of course i don't understand she owned i don't know as you'll understand it much more when i've explained it to you he said seating himself and motioning her to the other chair but yes of course you will you're a business woman you know what figures mean and really the whole thing is as simple as a b c you remember that i told you but are you going to stop to supper i must send annie out before the shops close supper no i couldn't eat anything i'm too worked up for that i'll get something at the hotel before i go to bed if i feel like it but say the thought suddenly struck him if you want to come out with me i'll blow you off to the swaggerest dinner in london what d'ye say she shook her head i shall have some bread and cheese and beer at nine that's my rule you know i don't like to break it i'm always queer next day if i do but now make haste and tell me you're really not broken then you have really come out well for answer he rose and drew himself to his full height and spread his bulky shoulders backward his grey blue eyes looked down upon her with a triumphant glow broken he echoed her word with emphasis my dear louisa i'm not the sort that gets broken i break other people oh god how i shall break them he began pacing up and down on the narrow rug before the fender excitedly telling his story to her sometimes he threw the words over his shoulder again he held her absorbed gaze with his he took his hands often from his pockets to illustrate or enforce by gestures the meaning of his speech and then she found it peculiarly difficult to realize that he was her brother much of the narrative rambling and disconnected with which he prefaced this story of the day was vaguely familiar to her he sketched now for her in summary and with the sonorous voice of one deeply impressed with the dramatic values of his declamation the chronicle of his wanderings in strange lands and these he had frequently told her about before soon she perceived however that he was stringing them together on a new thread one after another these experiences of his as he related them turned upon the obstacles and fatal pitfalls which treachery and malice had put in his path he seemed by his account to have been a hundred times almost within touch of the goal in china in the dutch indies in those remoter parts of australia which were a waterless waste when he knew them and might have owned them and now were yielding fabulous millions to fellows who had tricked and swindled him everywhere he had missed by just a hair's breadth the golden consummation in the western hemisphere the tale repeated itself there had been times in the argentine in brazil just before the empire fell in colorado when the silver boom was on in british columbia when the first rumours of rich ore were whispered about many times when fortune seemed veritably within his grasp but someone had always played him false there was never a friendship for him which could withstand the temptation of profitable treason but he had hung dauntlessly on he had seen one concession slipping through his fingers only to strain and tighten them for a clutch at another it did not surprise his hearer nor indeed did it particularly attract her attention that there was nowhere in this rapid and comprehensive narrative any allusion to industry of the wage earning sort apparently he had done no work at all in the bread winner's sense of the word this was so like joel that it was taken for granted in his sister's mind all his voyages and adventures and painful enterprises had been informed by the desire of the buccaneer the passion to reap where others had sown or at the worst to get something for nothing the discursive story began to narrow and concentrate itself when at last it reached mexico the sister changed her position in her chair and crossed her knees when tehuantepec was mentioned it was from that place that joel had sent her the amazing remittance over two years ago curiously enough though it was at this point in his narrative that he now became vague as to details there were concessions of rubber forests mentioned and the barter of these for other concessions with money to boot and varying phases of a chronic trouble about where the true boundary of guatemala ran but she failed clearly to understand much about it all his other schemes and mishaps she had followed readily enough somehow when they came to mexico however she saw everything jumbled and distorted as through a haze once or twice she interrupted him to ask questions but he seemed to attach such slight importance to her comprehending these details that she forbore only one fact was it necessary to grasp about the mexican episode apparently when he quitted tehuantepec to make his way straight to london at the beginning of the year he left behind him a rubber plantation which he desired to sell and brought with him between six and seven thousand pounds with which to pay the expenses of selling it how he had obtained either the plantation or the money did not seem to have made itself understood no doubt as his manner indicated when she ventured her enquiries it was quite irrelevant to the narrative in mexico his experience had been unique apparently in that no villain had appeared on the scene to frustrate his plans he at least mentioned no one who had wronged him there when he came to london however there were villains and to spare he moved to the mantel when he arrived at this stage of the story and made clear a space for his elbow to rest among the little trinkets and photographs with which it was burdened he stood still thereafter looking down at her his voice took on a harsher note much of this story also she knew by heart this strange bearded greyish haired brother of hers had come very often during the past half year to the little book shop and the widow's home above it his misshapen handbag full of papers his heart full of rage hope grief ambition disgust confidence everything but despair it was true it had never been quite real to her he was right in his suggestion that she had never wholly believed in him she had not been able to take altogether seriously this clumsy careworn shabbily dressed man who talked about millions it was true that he had sent her four hundred pounds for the education of her son and daughter it was equally true that he had brought with him to london a sum which any of his ancestors so far as she knew about them would have deemed a fortune and which he treated as merely so much oil with which to lubricate the machinery of his great enterprise she had heard at various times the embittered details of the disappearance of this money little by little nearly a quarter of it all told had been appropriated by a sleek old braggart of a company promoter who had cozened joel into the belief that london could be best approached through him when at last this wretch was kicked downstairs the effect had been only to make room for a fresh lot of bloodsuckers there were so called advertising agents so called journalists so called men of influence in the city a swarm of relentless and voracious harpies who dragged from him in blackmail nearly the half of what he had left before he summoned the courage and decision to shut them out worse still in some ways were the men into whose hands he stumbled next a group of city men concerned in the south african market who impressed him very favourably at the outset he got to know them by accident and at the time when he began to comprehend the necessity of securing influential support for his scheme everything that he heard and could learn about them testified to the strength of their position in the city because they displayed a certain amiability of manner toward him and his project he allowed himself to make sure of their support it grew to be a certainty in his mind that they would see him through he spent a good deal of money in dinners and suppers in their honour after they had let him understand that this form of propitiation was not unpleasant to them they chaffed him about some newspaper paragraphs in which he was described as the rubber king with an affable assumption of amusement under which he believed that he detected a genuine respect for his abilities finally when he had danced attendance upon them for the better part of two months he laid before them at the coffee and cigars stage of a dinner in a private room of the savoy the details of his proposition they were to form a syndicate to take over his property and place it upon the market in consideration of their finding the ready money for this exploitation they were to have for themselves two fifths of the shares in the company ultimately to be floated they listened to these details and to his enthusiastic remarks about the project itself with rather perfunctory patience but committed themselves that evening to nothing definite it took him nearly a week thereafter to get an answer from any of them then he learned that if they took the matter up at all it would be upon the basis of the syndicate receiving nine tenths of the shares he conceived the idea after he had mastered his original amazement that they named these preposterous terms merely because they expected to be beaten down and he summoned all his good nature and tact for the task of haggling with them he misunderstood their first show of impatience at this and persevered in the face of their tacit rebuffs then one day a couple of them treated him with overt rudeness and he astonished out of his caution replied to them in kind suddenly he could hardly tell why or how they were all enemies of his they closed their office doors to him even their clerks treated him with contemptuous incivility this blow to his pride enraged and humiliated him curiously enough as no other misadventure of his life had done louisa remembered vividly the description he had given to her at the time of this affair she had hardly understood why it should disturb him so profoundly to her mind these men had done nothing so monstrous after all but to him their offense swallowed up all the other indignities suffered during the years of his ishmaelitish wanderings a sombre lust for vengeance upon them took root in his very soul he hated nobody else as he hated them how often she had heard him swear in solemn vibrating tones that to the day of his death his most sacred ambition should be their punishment their abasement in the dust and mire and now all at once as she looked up at him where he leant against the mantel these vagabond memories of hers took point and shape it was about these very men that he was talking and think of it he was saying impressively it's magnificent enough for me to make this great hit but i don't count it as anything at all by comparison with the fact that i make it at their expense you remember the fellows i told you about he asked abruptly deferring to the confused look on her face yes you make it out of them she repeated in an uncertain voice it occurred to her that she must have been almost asleep but did i miss anything have you been telling what it is that you have made no that you shall have in good time you don't seem to realize it louisa i can hardly realize it myself i am actually a very rich man i can't tell how much i've got in fact it can be almost as much as i like half a million pounds i suppose at the start if i want to make it that much yes it takes the breath away doesn't it but best of all a thousand times best of all practically every dollar of it comes out of those kaffir swine the very men that tried to rob me and that have been trying to ruin me ever since i tell you what i wish louise i wish to god there could only be time enough and i'd take it all in half sovereigns two millions of them or three millions and just untwist every coin one by one out from among their heart strings oh but it'll be all right as it is it's enough to make a man feel religious to think how those thieves are going to suffer well she said slowly after reflection it all rather frightens me as if the chill in the air of the cheerless room had suddenly accentuated itself she arose took a match box from the mantel and stooping lit the fire he looked down at the tall black clad figure bent in stiff awkwardness over the smoking grate and his eyes softened then he took fresh note of the room the faded threadbare carpet the sparse old furniture that had seemed ugly to even his uninformed boyish taste the dingy walls and begrimed low ceiling all pathetic symbols of the bleak life to which she had been condemned frightens you he queried with a kind of jovial tenderness as she got to her feet frightens you eh why within a month's time old lady you'll be riding in the park in your own carriage with niggers folding their arms up behind and you'll be taking it all as easy and as natural as if you'd been born in a barouche he added in response to the enquiry of her lifted brows barouche that's what we'd call in england a landau she stood with a foot upon the fender her tired passive face inclined meditatively her rusty old black gown drawn back by one hand from the snapping sparks no she said slowly joyless resignation mingling with pride in her voice i was born here over the shop well good god so was i he commented lustily but that's no reason why i shouldn't wind up in park lane or you either she had nothing to say to this apparently after a little she seated herself again drawing her chair closer to the hearth it's years since i've lit this fire before the first of november she remarked with the air of defending the action to herself oh we're celebrating he said rubbing his hands over the reluctant blaze everything goes tonight her face as she looked up at him betrayed the bewilderment of her mind you set out to tell me what it was all about she reminded him you see i'm completely in the dark i only hear you say that you've made a great fortune that's all i know or perhaps you've told me as much as you care to why not at all he reassured her pulling his own chair toward him with his foot and sprawling into it with a grunt of relief if you'll draw me a glass of that beer of yours i'll tell you all about it it's not a thing for everybody to know not to be breathed to a human being for that matter but you'll enjoy it and it'll be safe enough with you as she rose and moved toward a door he called merrily after her no more beer when that keg runs dry you know nothing but champagne chapter iii thorpe took a long thoughtful pull at the beer his sister brought him ah i didn't know i was so thirsty he said when he put the glass down truth is i've lost track of myself altogether since since the big thing happened i seem to be somebody else a comparative stranger so to speak i've got to get acquainted with myself all over again you can't imagine what an extraordinary feeling it is this being hit every few minutes with the recollection that you're worth half a million it's like being struck over the head it knocks you down there are such thousands of things to do you dance about all of a flutter you don't know where to begin begin where you left off suggested louisa you were going to tell me how how the big thing happened you're always coming to it and never getting any further nodding comprehension of the rebuke's justification he plunged forthwith into the tale you remember my telling you at the time how i got my board together i'm speaking now of the present company after i'd decided to be my own promoter and have at least some kind of a look in for my money there wasn't much money left by the way it was considerably under three thousand but i come to that later first there was the board here was where that lord plowden that i told you about the man that came over on the ship with me came in i went to him i god i was desperate but i hadn't much of an idea he'd consent but he did he listened to me and i told him how i'd been robbed and how the syndicate would have cut my throat if i hadn't pulled away and he said why yes i'll go on your board then i told him more about it and presently he said he'd get me another man of title a sky scraper of a title too to be my chairman that's the marquis of chaldon a tremendous diplomatic swell you know ambassador at vienna in his time and lord lieutenant and all sorts of things but willing to gather in his five hundred a year all the same do you mean that you pay him five hundred pounds a year asked the sister yes i've got a live markiss who works for me at ten quid a week and a few extras the other directors get three hundred this lord plowden is one of them but i'll tell you more about him later on then there's watkin he's a small accountant finsbury way and davidson he's a wine merchant who used to belong to a big firm in dundee but gets along the best way he can on a very dicky business here in london now and then there's general kervick awfully well connected old chap they say but i guess he needs all he can get he's started wearing his fur coat already well that's my board i couldn't join it of course till after allotment that's because i'm the vendor as they call it but that hasn't interfered at all with my running the whole show the board doesn't really count you know it only does what i want it to do it's just a form that costs me seventeen hundred a year that's all seventeen hundred a year she repeated mechanically well then we got out the prospectus d'ye see or first there were other things to be done i saw that a good broker's name counted for a lot on a prospectus i picked out one that i'd heard was reasonable it'd been a splendid name if i could have got it but he calmly said his price was two thousand pounds all cash down and i came away finally i got a fellow who hadn't done much of anything yet and so wasn't so stiff about his figure he agreed to take 500 pounds cash and 2,000 in shares it was god's luck that i hit on him for he turned out at the pinch to be the one man in a million for me but i'll tell you about him later he's the broker mind you mustn't forget him well then he and i got a solicitor he took 200 pounds cash but he had to have 2,000 shares and the firm of auditors they were 100 pounds cash and 1,000 shares every company has to have these people pasted on to it by law oh yes and then you must have your bankers you don't pay them anything though thank god well then there was the machinery complete all ready to start i took a handsome set of offices and furnished them up to the nines but that i was able to do pretty well on credit you see ready money was getting short and now came the biggest pull of all there was the press to be worked he spoke as if there were no other papers in london but the financial journals i didn't sleep much while that was being fixed up you've got no more idea of what the press means louisa than you have of of a coil of snakes thawing out hungry in the spring why if one blackmailer came to me i swear a hundred did they scared the life out of me the first month or so and then there's a swarm of advertising agents who say they can keep these blackmailers off if you'll make it worth their while but they all wanted too much money for me and for a while i was at my wits ends at last i got a fellow he's not behaved so badly all things considered who had some sporting blood in his veins and he was willing to do the whole thing for 5,000 pounds if i could pay 1,500 pounds down and the rest in shares but that was just what i couldn't do you see so finally he took 1,000 pounds down and 5,000 in shares and as i say he's done it tolerably well there was one editor that i had to square personally that is to say 100 pounds cash it had to be in sovereigns for notes could be traced and a call of 2,000 shares at par he's the boss pirate that everybody has to square and of course there were odd ten pound notes here and there but as a rule i just opened the door and fired the black mailers out the moment a fellow came in and handed me his card and said he had proofs of two kinds of articles in his pocket one praising me one damning me i told him to go and see my advertising agent and if he wouldn't do that then to go to hell that's the way you've got to talk in the city he added as if in apologetic explanation louisa looked impassively at her brother oh i've heard the expression as far west as the strand she remarked well then came the issue that was last saturday you saw the prospectus in saturday morning's papers and in the weeklies the list was to be kept open it said till wednesday morning that was yesterday that is to say during all that time people could apply for shares which they didn't do according to your account the sister suggested dryly thorpe passed his fingers through his roughened hair and eyed her with a momentary quizzical gleam in his eye then he became serious again the recollection of what he was now to narrate brought a frown to his brows on tuesday afternoon he began with portentous deliberation or no first i must explain something you see in bringing out a company you can't put up too stout a bluff i mean you've got to behave as if you were rolling in wealth as if everything was coming your way and fortunes were to be made by fastening to you i don't know that it often fools anybody very much but it's part of the game and you must play it well accordingly my broker goes on change saturday morning and has his jobber shout out that he'll buy rubber consols that's what our shares are called on the street at an eighth premium that is to say he offered to buy for twenty two and six what we were offering to the public for twenty shillings of course you see the object of that was to create the impression that there was a regular god almighty rush for our shares as i say i don't know whether that ever fooled anybody but at least there was the chance that it might start up some dealing in the shares and all those things help besides you got the sales noticed in the papers and that might start up applications from the public well the broker bought 1,000 shares this way on saturday on monday when it might still be possible to change the luck he bought 3,500 more still at that premium of an eighth he bought some tuesday morning too say 4,000 well now keep those figures in your head and keep an eye on the broker he's worth watching as you'll see what's his name asked the sister with an accession of alertness in her face you call him broker and that doesn't mean anything to me they're all brokers aren't they semple colin semple that's his name he's a young scotchman father's a presbyterian minister he's a little insignificant runt of a chap to look at but i learned a long time ago not to judge a singed cat by his looks however where was i you were going to tell about tuesday afternoon weren't you he nodded gravely and straightened himself drawing a long breath in preparation for the dramatic recital before him on tuesday afternoon he began again with impressive slowness i was walking on throgmorton street about four o'clock it was raining a little it had been raining on and off all day a miserable rotten sort of a day with greasy mud everywhere and everybody poking umbrellas into you i was out walking because i'd a cut my throat if i'd"
