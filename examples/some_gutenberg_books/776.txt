"1" "group here and there so commonplace don't you loathe the commonplace not loathe really of course because the harmonious mind does not let itself be disturbed the harmonious mind realizes that dirt is only useful matter in the wrong place as tennyson sings so sweetly somewhere tennyson has quite gone out of course he is so so well if you get what i mean so mid victorian somehow it seems he was mid victorian all the time but it's only recently that it's been found out on him though i always will think of come into the garden maud as one of the world's sweetest little epics i'm very independent that way in spite of the critics after all criticism comes down to a question of individual taste doesn't it that is in the final analysis independence that is what this age needs nearly every night before i got to bed i say to myself have i been independent today or have i failed i believe in those little spiritual examinations don't you it helps one to keep in tune with the infinite you know the infinite how much it comprises and how little we really understand it we're going to take it up the infinite in a serious way soon our little group of advanced thinkers you know the romantic old days it must have been terribly difficult getting around in the days before automobiles were invented or railroads or anything like that though of course it was wonderfully romantic too the old coaching days particularly when everybody blew on horns as they drove from town to town and there were highwaymen and cavaliers with swords and all those people you know riding by the coaches don't you just dote on romance i do but of course there's no place for it in our hurried modern life and i suppose we shouldn't regret it but now and then i sigh over it like dropping a tear you know in a dear old chest perfumed with lavender and old roses i always say that one can be advanced and in the van of modern progress and still drop a tear you know do you think that all this study of sex hygiene means the death of romance it's a serious thought isn't it but what i always say is which of these things will do the most good in the world especially good to the poor you know how frightfully interested i am in the poor i make that my test i always say to myself which will do the most good to the great masses i take such a serious interest in the masses we should think twice before we take romance out of their lives and replace it with science of any kind for after all you know they represent the future we should all think of the future that's what makes the feminist movement such a wonderful thing it is moving right straight ahead toward the future i'm thinking of being a suffragist again i was once you know but i resigned the sashes and banners are such a frightful shade of yellow you know so i quit beauty after all is the chief thing what after all do all our reforms come to if the world is not to be made more beautiful because of them and i simply cannot wear yellow hermione's boswell explains believe me tis not with elation i dwell on hermione's madness the result of my rapt contemplation is sadness a terrible sadness i weep when i note how she drivels i sigh o'er her fake philanthropies i am pained when i see how she frivols like a kitten with serious topics it is grief that her mental condition inspires not laughter or scorning if she has any use til her mission to stand as a horrible warning i am moral essentially moral i am grave and hate everything trashy and that is the reason i quarrel with intellects flighty and flashy i yearn for the truth i am earnest i yearn to face facts without blinking of all of my years quite the yearnest is my yearn to be thorough in thinking that's why i'm severe with this darling nor pardon nor whitewash nor gloss her the linnet the parrot the starling i weep over her and expose her symbols and dew hopping last week the loveliest man lectured to us to our little group of serious thinkers you know on the ultimate symbolism in art and life both you know it was simply wonderful wonderful art you know used to be full of symbolism but now it seems symbolism has dropped out of art and nature has taken it up odd isn't it but really not surprising when you come to think about it for you know nature is always trying to keep up with advanced ideas evolving and evolving toward the superman and the superwoman too i think it is the duty of us who are advanced thinkers to give nature a worthy idea to evolve toward don't you to set nature a mark to come up to you know for what is the use of evolution if it doesn't evolve forward instead of backward and the best people i think should feel a sense of social responsibility and give evolution a model each should be a symbol that's what i always ask myself each night now have i been a symbol today or have i failed to be a symbol down at the beach last week i nearly drowned you don't mean to say you haven't heard of it it was frightful i'd always heard that when a person sinks his whole past life passes before him in review but it didn't with me what i said as i went down was have i been a symbol or have i failed and the life guard who got me out he was simply the most gorgeous man burned bronze you know and with shoulders like a greek god and with the most wonderful eyes and white teeth he asked me the guard did what marm it was fearfully disappointing sometimes they are college men you know just life guarding through the summer but would any college man have said what marm and then he went and saved a blonde creature in the most scandalous bathing suit i ever saw he saved one in the most business like way too as if he were a waiter you know passing from one table to another no wonder the social fabric is crumbling when quite impossible people like life guards permit themselves to become blase over such matters the lower classes are very discouraging anyhow don't you think after all we do for them in the way of philanthropy and sociology and uplifting them generally you know of course i haven't lost my interest in sociology not by any means i always hold fast the thought that all the world are brothers i'm taking up dew hopping next week it's a wonderful new nerve cure formerly it was quite the thing to walk barefoot in the dew at dawn but at this new place i've discovered they don't merely walk that's going out quite they hop like frogs and toads you know it brings the patients into closer kinship with the electric currents of the earth hopping does the doctor says it's wonderful he is the loveliest man with mystic eyes the doctor is the song of the snore fothergil finch hermione's friend the vers libre poet dodges through life harried and hunted by one pursuing fear some day he said to me it is hermione's boswell who is speaking in this sketch in the first person and not hermione the incomparable some day fothergil finch said to me the other night in a tone of intense bitter conviction some day it will get me some day i will overtake me the great beat popularity which pursues me some day it will clutch me and tear me and devour my soul some day i will be a popular writer it is my own impression that fothergil's fears are exaggerated but they are very real to him he visualizes his own soul as a fugitive climbing higher and higher running faster and faster to escape this beast perhaps fothergil secretly hopes that the speed of his gong will induce combustion and he will leap from the topmost hills of art flaming directly into the heavens there to burn and shine immortality an authentic star well well we all have our little plane our little vanities fothergil i said cheerily popularity has not overtaken you yet cheer up perhaps it never will we were in fothergil's studio in greenwich village where i had gone to see how his poem on moonlight was getting along he strode to the window fothergil is not tall and he is slightly pigeon toed the fleshly toes of fothergil symbolize the toes of his ever fleecing soul but he strides female poets undulate erotic male poets saunter tramp poets lurch and swagger fothergil being a vers libre poet a prophet of the virile a little brother of the cosmic urge is compelled by what his verse is to stride vigorously across rooms as if they were vast desert places in spite of what his toes are he strode magnificently triumphantly to the window and flung the shade up and looked out at the amorphous mist creeping in across the roofs the crawling fog must have suggested his great gray dread for presently he turned away with a shudder and sank upon a couch and moaned ah heaven popularity the disgrace of it the horror of it popularity ignominy when it catches me when it happens he plucked from his pocket a small phial and held it up toward the light and gazed upon it desperately and raptly i am never without this he said it is my means of escape i will not be taken unawares i carry it always at night it is beneath my pillow the day it happens the moment i feel myself in the grip of popularity i caught his hand in his excitement he was raising the poison to his lips what i cannot understand fothergil i said is why a poet of the virile a reincarnation of the cave man excuse me but that is what you are being this year is it not should give way to fear is it not more in character to meet this beast and slay it is there not a certain contradiction between your profession and your practice more than a contradiction he said eagerly it is more than contradictory it is paradoxical i eliminate much that followed when fothergil gets started on the paradox time passes he is never really interested in things until he has dis covered the paradoxical quality in them sometimes i think that his enthusiasm over himself is due to the fact that he discovered early in life that he himself was a paradox and sometimes i think that discovery is the explanation of his enthusiasm for the paradox what said fothergil is the most paradoxical thing in the world the human snore it seems ugly yet it is beautiful it seems a trivial function of the body and yet it is the key to the soul the key to the soul man sleeps he said and his conscious mind is in abeyance but his subconscious mind is still awake it functions it has its opportunity to utter itself the snore is the voice of the soul and not only the soul of the individual but of the soul of the race all the experiences of man in his ascent from the mire to his present altitude are retained in the subconscious mind his fights his struggles his falls his recoveries and his dreams and nightmares are racial memories of these things snores are the language in which he expresses them interpret the snore and you have the psychic history of the ascent of man from caliban to shakespeare and i can interpret it i have listened to a million snores and learned the language of the soul night after night for years i harked to the human snore in summer hastening from park bench to beach and back again in winter haunting the missions and lodging houses ah heavens with what devotion with what passion of the discoverer have i not pursued the human snore i have gone miles to listen to some snore that was reported to be peculiar i have denied my self luxuries pleasures and at times even food in order to hire reluctant persons to snore for me and i have written the epic of the snore in vers libre you shall hear the prelude and this is fothergil's prelude snore me a song of the soul oh sleeper snore whistle me wheeze me grunkle and grunt gurgle and snort me a virile stave snore till the cosmos shakes on the wings of a snore i fly backward a billion years and grasp the mastodon and i tear him limb from limb and with his thigh hone i heat the dinosaur to death for i am virile snore snore snore snore o struggling and troubled and squirming and suffering and choking and purple faced sleeper snore snore me the sound of the brutal struggle when the big bull planets bellowed and fought with one another in the bloody dawn of time for the love of little yellow haired moons snore snore till chaos raps with his boot on the walls of cosmos and kicks to the landlord turn choke twist and struggle sleeper and snore me the song of life in the making sneeze me a universe full of star dust snore me back to the days when i was a cave man and with my bare hands slew the walrus for i am virile snore the death rattle of the walrus o struggling sleeper snore snore me but i was compelled to leave there is a great deal of it fothergil says if you know fothergil you are aware that when he declaims his virile verses he becomes excited he swells physically sometimes he looks quite five feet tall in his moments of expansion all this is very bad for him more than once the declamation of his poem myself and the cosmic urge has sent him shaking to the tea urn before i left i was able to calm him somewhat but with calm came reflection and with reflection came his great gray dread again when i left fothergil was looking out of the window and shuddering as if the monster popularity might be hiding behind the neighboring chimneys one hand clasped the phial caressingly but somehow i doubt that fothergil will ever be compelled to drink the poison ballade of understanding does not the world's stupidity at times make serious thinkers fret i asked the fair hermione sometimes she said and yet and yet we feel we owe the world a debt she waved a slim bejeweled hand she brooded on some vague regret i hope she sighed you'll understand is not your high philosophy too subtle for the mob to get i asked she pondered seriously sometimes she said and yet and yet she trifled with an amulet imported from some orient land what fish can burst the cosmic net i hope she sighed you'll understand art science and psychology causes that rise and shine and set do all these never weary thee sometimes she said and yet and yet would thought and life have ever met unless she paused her lashes fanned her eyes with tears of ardor wet i hope she sighed you'll understand princess is bull the one best bet sometimes she said and yet and yet she mused and then in accents bland i hope she said you'll understand hermione on fashions and war isn't war frightful though simply frightful what sherman said it was you know though they say there's an economic condition back of this war too we took up economics not long ago our little group of serious thinkers you know and gave an entire evening to it it's wonderful simply wonderful without economics you know there couldn't be any civilization that's a thought that should give one pause isn't it although of course this war may destroy civilization entirely if i thought it was likely to do that i would join in the peace demonstration at once or have they had it already the march for peace you know anyhow no matter what the personal sacrifice might be i would join in not that i care to march in the dust and black never did become me but i suppose there will be some autos and well one must sacrifice for if civilization dies out what will become of us then will we revert to the primordial will the cave man triumph the very idea gives me the creeps because you know the cave man is all right and the primitive and all that as a protest against decadence and in a literary way but if all men were cave men well you know the thought is frightful simply frightful you can have a feeling for just one cave man you know in the midst of civilization when a million cave men would but the idea is too terrible for words and in this crisis it is woman who must save the world the loveliest woman she's quite advanced really and has the most charming toilettes told our little group of serious thinkers the other night that this is the time when woman must rule the world it is the test of the new woman if anything is saved from the wreck it will be because of her she can write letters to the papers you know against war and and all that sort of thing you know and of course if the germans and russians and english do all get together and conquer paris i suppose they won't kill the modistes and designers civilization you know is not so easily killed after all the romans were conquered you know but all their styles and philosophies and things were taken up by the medes and persians who conquered them and have remained unchanged in those countries ever since but in a time like this it's comforting to have a cause to cling to no matter what happens the advanced thinkers must cling together and make their cause count and if england should conquer france and put a king on the throne there again no doubt there will be a great revival of fashion as there was in the days of napoleon i and the empress eugenie but if all the advanced thinkers in the world could only get together in one place and think peace and harmony sit down in circles you know and send psychic vibrations across the ocean who can tell but what the war might not end the triumph of mind over matter you know i'm going to propose the idea to our little group and pass it on to all the other little groups i'd be willing to give up an entire evening to it myself urges and dogs we had quite a discussion the other evening our little group of serious thinkers you know as to whether it was idealism or materialism that had gotten the germans into this dreadful war isn't idealism just simply wonderful fothy finch said it was neither he said it was the racial urge it's like the cosmic urge you know except it's altogether german fothy explained every once in a while you hear of a new urge that's one of the things that distinguishes modern thought from the old philosophies don't you think although of course the cosmic urge isn't what it used to be a year or two ago it's become er well vulgarized if you know what i mean everybody's writing and talking about it now don't you know i think myself it's going out soon and a leader a real pioneer in thought you know would scarcely care to talk about it now without a smile i've just about dropped it myself it's the same way with everything exclusive it soon becomes common really i hadn't worn my white summer furs three weeks before i saw so many imitations that i just simply had to lay them aside don't you think people who take up things like that after the real leaders have dropped them are frightfully lacking in subtlety oh subtlety subtlety what would modern thought be without subtlety personally i just simply hate the obvious it's so so well so easily seen through if you know what i mean fothy finch said to me only the other day has it ever occurred to you hermione that you are not an obvious sort of person it is almost uncanny the way fothergil finch can read my thoughts sometimes we are both so very psychic mamma said to me last night you are seeing a great deal of mr finch hermione do you think it is right to encourage him if you don't intend to marry him what are your intentions with regard to mr finch i didn't answer her at all poor dear mamma is so old fashioned but i thought to myself well would it be so impossible of course marriage is a serious thing one must look at it from all points of view if one has a social conscience he has a lovely way with dogs fothy has they trust him instinctively he is just dear with them i have some beauties now you know they are getting so they won't let anyone but fothy bathe them moods and poppies we took up the bhagavad gita our little group of advanced thinkers you know in quite a thorough way the other evening isn't the bhagavad gita just simply wonderful it has nothing at all to do with bagdad you know though at first glance it seems quite like it might doesn't it of course they're both oriental aren't you just simply wild about oriental things but really they're quite different the bhagavad gita you know is all about reincarnation and karma and all those lovely old things when i start my salon i'm going to have a bhagavad gita evening all in costume you know i find that when i dress in harmony with the idea i radiate so much more effectively if you get what i mean fothergil finch is the same way he writes his best vers libre things in a purple dressing gown there's an amber colored pane of glass in his studio skylight and he has to sit and wait and wait and wait until the moonlight falls through that pane onto his paper and then it only stays long enough so he can write a few lines and he can't go on with the poem until he comes again he brought me one last night he wrote it to me yes really and he waited and waited for enough moonlight to do it and caught a terrible cold in his head poor dear fothy it goes like this poppies poppies silver poppies in the moonlight poppies silver poppies silver poppies in the moonlight youth poppies poppies crimson poppies in the sunset love poppies poppies poppies black poppies in the midnight death three colors of poppies one color is silver the second color is crimson the third color is black and if there were a fourth color it would be green alas why is there never a fourth color poppies poppies poppies but no green poppy i asked the little crippled girl who sells poppies to buy bread for the drunken father who beats her and she said i too seek the fourth color i asked the boy who drives the grocer's delivery wagon the old apple woman without teeth the morgue keeper the plumber the janitor the red armed waffle baker in the window of a restaurant full of marble topped tables and pallid looking girls the subway guard and the millionaire and they all said poppies poppies poppies we have never known but three colors i am a great virile spirit i with my ego i will give the world its desire i the strong i the daring i will create a green poppy that about being virile is just like fothy he prides himself on being virile you know poor dear fothy he said until he saw me he had always been satisfied with silver and red and black poppies but as soon as he knew me he felt there must be a green poppy somewhere it is likely a mood of my soul you know the green poppy is isn't it simply wonderful concentration isn't it just simply terrible the way the balkans are bombarding venice all those beautiful doges and things you know i suppose there will be nothing left just simply nothing of the city that byron wrote about in in what was it oh yes in childe harold to the dark tower came that's one comforting thing to think of if this country ever gets into a war isn't it i mean that we haven't any of those lovely old things that can be bombarded you know i suppose if we ever did get into war someone like edison would invent something quick you know and it would be all over in a few hours isn't inventive science wonderful just simply wonderful it's so so well so dynamic if you get what i mean isn't it don't you just dote on dynamic things dynamic personalities especially i've often thought if i had it to do over again i'd go in less for psychics and more for dynamics but then there are so many things that a modern thinker must keep up with aren't there and it's easy enough to concentrate one's mind on one or two things but i often find it terribly difficult to concentrate on ten or twelve different things all at the same time and one must if one is to keep up with the very latest in thought and life concentration concentration that is the key to it all nearly every night when i am alone with my own ego i go into the silences for a little period of spiritual self examination and i always ask myself have i concentrated today really concentrated or have i failed i call these little times my psychic inquisitions in the hurry of this crowded age one must find time to get along with one's self must one not fothy finch has written a beautiful thing about the hurry of this crowded age which i wish everyone could hang over his desk well i must be going on now i have a committee meeting for this afternoon i can't for the life of me remember whether it's about suffrage oh yes i marched or about some relief fund soul mates i'm taking up bergson this week next week i'm going to take up etruscan vases and the montessori system oh no i haven't lost my interest in sociology only the other night we went down in the auto and watch the bread line of course one can take up too many things it's the spirit in which you take up a thing that counts sometimes i think the spirit in which you take a thing up counts more than the thing itself counts in its effect on you you know of course the way to get the real meaning out of any thing is to put yourself in a receptive attitude in serious things the attitude counts for everything one mustn't scoff if you look seriously and scientifically you'll see there's a great deal more than you suspected in all this affinity and soul mate craze for instance not that i care much for the words soul mate and affinity particularly they have been so vulgarized somehow the best people don't use those terms any more psychic harmony is the new term the loveliest man explained all about it to us the other day i belong to a little group of thinkers who take a serious interest in these things you know we are trying to find out how to make our psychic powers count for the betterment of the world i am very psychic some are now this man had the most interesting eyes and the silkiest beard and he said his aura was pink if he should meet a girl you know with an aura just the shade of pink that his aura is why then they would know they were in psychic harmony simple isn't it but then all truly great ideas are simple aren't they but if his aura was blue and her aura was yellow then of course they would quarrel that's what makes so much domestic unhappiness but he said something that gave me the most frightfully insecure feeling he said the aura changes its color as the soul progresses two people may be in harmony today and both have pink auras and in a year hers may be green and his golden what desperate chances a woman takes when she marries doesn't she i sometimes think life must have been a much more comfortable thing before the world got to be so terribly advanced but of course it is our duty to sacrifice personal comfort for the future of the race and the betterment of the world as i was looking at the bread line the thought came to me that the chief difference between this advanced age and other ages was in the fact that people today are"
