"1" "mire perform and accepted we dined at the club and arrived at the theater rather late the audience was brilliant indeed though i had been an ardent first nighter for a year or two in my callow youth i think i have never seen such a representation of fashion and genius in america except at the opera billy and i sat in the orchestra about the twelfth row and half the faces in sight were well known to me whether le mire could dance or not she most assuredly was or had a good press agent we were soon to receive an exemplification of at least a portion of the reputation that had preceded her many were the angry adjectives heaped on the head of the dancer on that memorable evening mrs frederick marston i remember called her an insolent hussy but then mrs frederick marston was never original others rash impudent saucy impertinent in each instance accompanied by threats indeed it is little wonder if those people of fashion and wealth and position were indignant and sore for they had dressed and dined hastily and come all the way down town to see le mire they waited for her for two hours and a half in stuffy theater seats and le mire did not appear the announcement was finally made by the manager of the theater at a little before eleven o'clock he could not understand he said the poor fellow was on the point of wringing his hands with agitation and despair he could not understand why the dancer did not arrive she had rehearsed in the theater on the previous thursday afternoon and had then seemed to have every intention of fulfilling her engagement no one connected with the theater had seen her since that time but everything had gone smoothly they had had no reason to fear such a contretemps as her nonappearance they had sent to her hotel she was gone bag and baggage she had departed on friday leaving no word as to her destination they had asked the police the hotels the railroads the steamship companies and could find no trace of her the manager only hoped he hoped with all his heart that his frank and unreserved explanation would appease his kind patrons and prevent their resentment that they would understand i made my way out of the theater as rapidly as possible with billy du mont at my side and started north on broadway my companion was laughing unrestrainedly what a joke he exclaimed and gad what a woman she comes in and turns the town upside down and then leaves it standing on its head what wouldn't i give to know her i nodded but said nothing at forty second street we turned east to fifth avenue and a few minutes later were at the club i took du mont to a secluded corner of the grill and there with a bottle of wine between us i spoke billy said i there's the deuce to pay you're an old friend of mine and you possess a share of discretion and you've got to help me le mire is gone i must find her find le mire he stared at me in amazement what for because my brother harry is with her then i explained in as few words as possible and i ended i think with something like this you know billy there are very few things in the world i consider of any value she can have the lad's money and if necessary my own into the bargain but the name of lamar must remain clean and i tell you there is more than a name in danger whoever that woman touches she kills and harry is only a boy billy helped me as i knew he would nor did he insist on unnecessary details i didn't need his assistance in the search for i felt that i could accomplish that as well alone but it was certainly known that harry had been calling on le mire at her hotel conjectures were sure to be made leading to the assertions of busy tongues and it was the part of my friend to counteract and smother the inevitable gossip this he promised to do and i knew billy as for finding harry it was too late to do anything that night and i went home and to bed the next morning i began by calling at her hotel but though the manager of the theater had gotten no information from them he had pumped them dry they knew nothing i dared not go to the police and probably they would have been unable to give me any assistance if i had sought it the only other possible source of information i disliked to use but after racking my brain for the better part of the day i decided that there was nothing else for it and started on a round of the ticket offices of the railroads and steamship companies i had immediate success my first call was at the office where harry and i were accustomed to arrange our transportation as i entered the head clerk or whatever they call him advanced to greet me with a smile yes said he in response to my question mr lamar got his tickets from me let's see thursday wasn't it no friday that's right friday tickets i muttered to myself and in my preoccupation i really neglected to listen to him then aloud where were the tickets for denver for friday's train yes the western express that was all i wanted to know i hurried home procured a couple of hastily packed bags and took the afternoon train for the west chapter iii a modern marana my journey westward was an eventful one but this is not a history of tom jones and i shall refrain from detail denver i reached at last after a week's stop over in kansas city it was a delightful adventure but it had nothing to do with the story i left the train at the rocky mountain city about the middle of the afternoon and now what to do i think i am not a fool but i certainly lack the training of a detective and i felt perfectly rudderless and helpless as i ordered the taxi driver to take me to the alcazar hotel i was by no means sure that harry had come to denver he was traveling with a bundle of animated caprice a creature who would have hauled him off the train at rahway new jersey if she had happened to take a fancy to the place at the moment i reflected they might be driving along michigan boulevard or attending a matinee at the willis wood or sipping mint juleps at the planters even if they were in denver how was i to find them i keenly regretted the week i had lost i was sure that harry would avoid any chance of publicity and would probably shun the big hotels and denver is not a village it was the beauty of le mire that saved me indeed i might have foreseen that and i have but poorly portrayed the force of her unmatchable fascination unless you have realized that she was a woman who could pass nowhere without being seen and seen remembered i made inquiries of the manager of the hotel of course but was brought up sharply when he asked me the names of my friends for whom i was asking i got out of it somehow some foolish evasion or other and regarded my task as more difficult than ever that same evening i dined at the home of my cousin hovey stafford who had come west some years before on account of weak lungs and stayed because he liked it i met his wife that evening for the first time she may be introduced with the observation that if she was his reason for remaining in the provinces never did man have a better one we were on the veranda with our after dinner cigars i was congratulating hovey on the felicity of his choice and jocularly sympathizing with his wife yes said my cousin with a sigh i never regretted it till last week it will never be the same again mrs hovey looked at him with supreme disdain i suppose you mean senora ramal said she scornfully her husband feigning the utmost woe nodded mournfully whereupon she began humming the air of the chanson du colonel and was stopped by a smothering kiss and who is the senora ramal i asked the most beautiful woman in the world said mrs hovey this from a woman who was herself beautiful amazing i suppose my face betrayed my thought it isn't charity she smiled like john holden i have seen fire balloons by the hundred i have seen the moon and then i saw no more fire balloons but who is she hovey explained she is the wife of senor ramal they came here some ten days ago with letters to one or two of the best families and that's all we know about them the senora is an entrancing mixture of cleopatra sappho helen of troy and the devil she had the town by the ears in twenty four hours and you wouldn't wonder at it if you saw her already i felt that i knew but i wanted to make sure byron has described her i suggested in childe harold hardly said hovey no midnight beauty for hers thank you her hair is the most perfect gold her eyes are green her skin remarkably fair what she may be is unknowable but she certainly is not spanish and odder still the senor himself fits the name no better but i thought it needless to ask for a description of harry for i had no doubt of the identity of senor ramal and his wife i pondered over the name and suddenly realized that it was merely lamar spelled backward the discovery removed the last remaining shadow of doubt i asked in a tone of assumed indifference for their hotel expressing a desire to meet them and was informed by hovey that they had left denver two days previously nor did he know where they had gone thus did i face another obstacle but i was on the track and the perfume of a woman's beauty is the strongest scent in the world as well as the sweetest i thanked my cousin for a pleasant evening though he did not know the extent of my debt to him and declined his urgent invitation to have my luggage brought to his home on my way to the hotel i was struck by a sudden thought senor ramal could not be my brother or my cousin would have recognized him but i immediately reflected that the two had not seen each other for some ten years at which time harry had been a mere boy the following morning with little difficulty i ascertained the fact that the ramals had departed at least ostensibly for colorado springs i followed that same evening when i registered at the antlers hotel a few minutes before the dinner hour i turned over two pages of the book and there before me was the entry senor and senora ramal paris it was in harry's handwriting after dinner a most excellent dinner with melons from la junta and trout from the mountain streams i descended on the hotel clerk with questions he was most obliging a sharp pleasant fellow with prominent ears and a rocky mountain twang senor and senora ramal most assuredly sir they have been here several days no they are not now in the hotel they left this afternoon for manitou to take dinner there and are going to make the night trip up the peak an idea immediately suggested itself to me they would of course return to the hotel in the morning all i had to do was to sit down and wait for them but that would have been dull sport my idea was better i sought out the hotel's wardrobe there is nothing the antlers will not do for you and clothed myself in khaki leggings and boots then i ordered a car and set out for manitou at the foot of the mountain by ten o'clock i was mounted on a donkey headed for the top after having been informed by a guide that the man and the beautiful lady had departed an hour previous having made the ascent twice before i needed no guide so i decided but i regretted the decision three times i lost the path once i came perilously near descending on the village below well without hesitation it was well after midnight when i passed the half way house and i urged my donkey forward with a continual rat a tat tat of well directed kicks in the effort to make my goal you who have experienced the philosophical calm and superb indifference of the pike's peak donkey may imagine the vocabulary i used on this occasion i dare not print it nor did his speed increase i was in fact a quarter of an hour late i was still several hundred yards from the summit when the sun's first rays shot through the thin atmosphere creating colorful riot among the clouds below and i stopped holding my breath in awe there is no art nor poetry in that wonderful sight it is glorious war the sun charges forth in a vast flame of inconceivable brilliance you can almost hear the shout of victory he who made the universe is no artist too often he forgets restraint and blinds us i turned almost regretting that i had come for i had been put out of tune with my task then i mounted the donkey and slowly traversed the few remaining yards to the peak there seated in the dazzling sunshine on the edge of a huge boulder near the eastern precipice were the two i sought le mire's head was turned from me as she sat gazing silently at the tumbling gorgeous mass of clouds that seemed almost to be resting on her lap harry was looking at her and such a look there was no rival even in nature that could conquer le mire never i believe did woman achieve a more notable victory than hers of that morning i watched them for several minutes before i moved or spoke and never once did harry's eyes leave her face then i advanced a step calling his name and they turned and caught sight of me paul cried harry leaping to his feet then he stopped short and stared at me half defiantly half curiously moving close to le mire and placing his hand on her shoulder like a child clinging to a toy his companion had not moved except to turn her head but after the first swift shadow of surprise her face brightened with a smile of welcome for all the world as though this were a morning call in her boudoir senor and senora ramal i believe said i with a smile crossing to them with an exaggerated bow i could see harry cocking his ear to catch the tone of my first words and when he heard their friendliness a grin overspread his face he took his hand from le mire's shoulder and held it out to me how did you come here how did you find us you forgot to provide le mire with a veil said i by way of answer harry looked at me then at his companion of course he agreed of course by jove that was stupid of us whereupon le mire laughed with such frank enjoyment of the boy's simplicity that i couldn't help but join her and now said harry i suppose you want to know i want to know nothing at present i interrupted it's nearly six o'clock and since ten last night i've been on top of the most perfectly imbecile donkey ever devised by nature i want breakfast velvet lids were upraised from le mire's eyes here she queried i pointed to the place extreme charity might give it the title of inn where smoke was rising from a tin chimney soon we were seated inside with a pot of steaming black coffee before us harry was bubbling over with gaiety and good will evidently occasioned by my unexpected friendliness while le mire sat for the most part silent it was easy to see that she was more than a little disturbed by my arrival which surprised me i gazed at her with real wonder and increasing admiration it was six in the morning she had had no sleep and had just finished a most fatiguing journey of some eight hours but i had never seen her so beautiful our host approached and i turned to him what have you there was pity in his glance aigs said he with an air of finality ah said le mire i want them let's see au beurre noire if you please the man looked at her and uttered the single word fried fried said she doubtfully only fried was the inexorable answer how many le mire turned to me and i explained then she turned again to the surly host with a smile that must have caused him to regret his gruffness well then fr r ied said she rolling the r deliciously and you may bring me five if you please it appeared that i was not the only hungry one we ate leisurely and smoked more leisurely still and started on our return journey a little before eight o'clock it was late in the afternoon when we arrived at the antlers the trip was accomplished without accident but le mire was thoroughly exhausted and harry was anything but fresh that is the worst of mountain climbing the exaltation at the summit hardly pays you for the reaction at the foot we entered the broad portico with frank sighs of relief i said something about joining them at dinner and left for my own rooms at dinner that evening harry was in high spirits and took great delight in everything that was said both witty and dull while le mire positively sparkled she made her impression not a man in the well filled room but sent his tribute of admiring glances as she sat seemingly unconscious of all but harry and myself that is always agreeable a man owes something to the woman who carries a room for him i had intended to have a talk with harry after dinner but i postponed it the morning would assuredly be better there was dancing in the salon but we were all too tired to take advantage of it and after listening to one or two numbers during which le mire was kept busy turning aside the importunities of would be partners we said good night and sought our beds it was late the next morning when the precious pair joined me in the garden and when we went in for breakfast we found the dining room quite empty we did not enjoy it as on the morning previous the cuisine was of the kind usually and in this case justly described as superior but we did not have the same edge on our appetite we were not very talkative i myself was almost taciturn having before me the necessity of coming to an understanding with harry a task which i was far from relishing but there were certain things i must know what do you say to a ride down the valley said harry they have excellent horses here i tried one of em the other day i trust that they bear no resemblance to my donkey said i with feeling ugh said le mire with a shudder never shall i forget that ride besides she added turning to harry this morning i would be in the way don't you know that your brother has a thousand things to say to you he wants to scold you you must remember that you are a very bad boy and she sent me a glance half defiant half indifferent which plainly said if i fight you i shall win but i really care very little about it one way or the other after breakfast she went to her room to have her hair dressed she said and i led harry to a secluded corner of the magnificent grounds surrounding the hotel during the walk we were both silent harry i suppose was wondering what i was going to say while i was trying to make up my own mind i suppose he began abruptly you are going to tell me i have acted like a fool go ahead the sooner it's over the better nothing of the sort said i glad that he had opened it he stopped short demanding to know what i meant of course i continued le mire is a most amazing prize not exactly my style perhaps but there are few men in the world who wouldn't envy you i congratulate you but there were two things i feared for several reasons le mire's fascination your own youth and impulsive recklessness and the rather curious mode of your departure i feared first and most that you would marry her second that you would achieve odium and publicity for our name harry was regarding me with a smile which had in it very little of amusement it held a tinge of bitterness and so he burst out suddenly you were afraid i would marry her well i would the last time i asked her again the smile was this morning and she won't have me bah i concealed my surprise for i had really not thought it possible that the lad could be such a fool what's her game harry game the deuce i tell you she won't have me you have asked her a thousand times i've begged her on my knees offered her anything and she refuses positively refuses with thanks i stared at him for a moment in silence then i said go and get her and bring her here i'll find out what she wants and sat down on a bench to wait harry departed for the hotel without a word in a few minutes he returned with le mire i rose and proffered her a seat on the bench which she accepted with a smile and harry sat down at her side i stood in front of them le mire said i and i believe i frowned my brother tells me that you have been offered the name of lamar in marriage i have thanked him for it said she with a smile and declined it and declined it she agreed well said i i am not a man of half measures as you will soon see le mire besides i appreciate your power on the day i continued with slow precision on the day that you give me a contract to adhere to that refusal you may have my check for one million dollars she surprised me i admit it i had expected a burst of anger with a touch of assumed hauteur the surrender to follow for i had made the stake high but as i stood looking down at her waiting for the flash of her eye i was greeted by a burst of laughter the frank laughter of genuine mirth then she spoke oh you americans you are so funny a million dollars it is impossible that i should be angry after such a compliment besides you are so funny do you not know le mire am i not a princess if i desire it tomorrow today bah there is the world is it not mine mrs lamar ugh pardon me my friend but it is an ugly name you know my ancestors de l'enclos montalais maintenon la marana they were happy in their way and they were great i must do nothing unworthy of them set your mind at rest mr lamar but really you should have known better you who have seen the world and le mire in paris and now our amusement is perhaps ended now we must return to that awful new york voila indeed i had not understood her and how could i there is only one such woman in a generation sometimes none for nature is sparing of her favorites by pure luck she sat before me this twentieth century marana and i acknowledged her presence with a deep bow of apology and admiration if you will forgive me madame i said i will not attempt to make reparation for my words were not meant for you consider them unspoken as for our amusement why need it end surely we can forget i see plainly i am not a st evremond but neither am i a fool my brother pleases you well there he is as for myself i shall either stay to take care of you two children or i shall return to new york as you desire le mire looked at me uncertainly for a moment then turned to harry and with a fluttering gesture took his hand in her own and patted it gaily then she laughed the happy laugh of a child as she said then it is well and monsieur you are less an american than i thought by all means stay we shall be so jolly will we not my little friend harry nodded smiling at her but there was a troubled look in his face chapter iv allons the events of the month that followed though exciting enough were of a similarity that would make their narration tedious and i shall pass over them as speedily as possible we remained at colorado springs only two days after that morning in the garden le mire always in search of novelty urged us away and since we really had nothing in view save the satisfaction of her whims we consented salt lake city was our next resting place but le mire tired of it in a day i shall see the pacific she said to harry and me and we immediately set out for san francisco is it necessary for me to explain my attitude but surely it explains itself for one thing i was disinclined to leave harry in a position where he was so abundantly unable to take care of himself for another i take amusement wherever it offers itself and i was most certainly not bored the vagaries and caprices of a beautiful woman are always interesting and when you are allowed to study them at close range without being under the necessity of acting the part of a faithful lover they become doubly so le mire managed harry with wonderful tact and finesse i sat back and laughed at the performance now and then applying a check when her riotous imagination seemed likely to run away with us at san francisco she achieved a triumph notorious to the point of embarrassment paul lamar of new york had introduced himself into the highest circle of society and in turn had introduced his friends senor and senora ramal the senora captured the town in a single night at a reception and ball on telegraph hill the day following there were several dozens of cards left for her at our hotel invitations arrived by the score she accepted two or three and made the fortune of two drawing rooms then suddenly tired of the sport and insulted a most estimable lady our hostess by certain remarks which inadvertently reached the ears of the lady's husband you have done for yourself le mire i told her she answered me with a smile straightway proceeded to issue invitations for an entertainment at our hotel i had no idea what she meant to do but gave the thing no thought feeling certain that few or none of the invitations would be accepted wherein i was badly mistaken for not one was refused well le mire danced for them for myself it was barely interesting i have passed the inner portals of the sacred temples of india and the human body holds no surprises for me but the good people of san francisco were shocked astonished and entranced not a man in the room but was le mire's slave even the women were forced to applaud she became at once a goddess and an outcast the newspapers of the following morning were full of it running the scale of eulogy admiration and wonder and one of the articles evidently written by a man who had been considerably farther east than san francisco ended with the following paragraph in short it was sublime and with every movement and every gesture there was a something hidden a suggestion of a personality and mysterious charm that we have always heretofore considered the exclusive property of just one woman in the world but desiree le mire is not in san francisco though we declare that the performance of last evening was more than enough to rouse certain suspicions especially in view of le mire's mysterious disappearance from new york i took the paper to desiree in her room and while she read the article stood gazing idly from a window it was about eleven in the morning harry had gone for a walk saying that he would return in half an hour to join us at breakfast well said desiree when she had finished but it is not well i retorted turning to face her i do not reproach you you are being amused"
