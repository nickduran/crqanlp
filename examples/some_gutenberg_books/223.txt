"1" "evidences let us take the first proof we found the first fact we fell over when we fell into this room if there is no mr glass whose hat is this it is mr todhunter's replied father brown but it doesn't fit him cried hood impatiently he couldn't possibly wear it father brown shook his head with ineffable mildness i never said he could wear it he answered i said it was his hat or if you insist on a shade of difference a hat that is his and what is the shade of difference asked the criminologist with a slight sneer my good sir cried the mild little man with his first movement akin to impatience if you will walk down the street to the nearest hatter's shop you will see that there is in common speech a difference between a man's hat and the hats that are his but a hatter protested hood can get money out of his stock of new hats what could todhunter get out of this one old hat rabbits replied father brown promptly what cried dr hood rabbits ribbons sweetmeats goldfish rolls of coloured paper said the reverend gentleman with rapidity didn't you see it all when you found out the faked ropes it's just the same with the sword mr todhunter hasn't got a scratch on him as you say but he's got a scratch in him if you follow me do you mean inside mr todhunter's clothes inquired mrs macnab sternly i do not mean inside mr todhunter's clothes said father brown i mean inside mr todhunter well what in the name of bedlam do you mean mr todhunter explained father brown placidly is learning to be a professional conjurer as well as juggler ventriloquist and expert in the rope trick the conjuring explains the hat it is without traces of hair not because it is worn by the prematurely bald mr glass but because it has never been worn by anybody the juggling explains the three glasses which todhunter was teaching himself to throw up and catch in rotation but being only at the stage of practice he smashed one glass against the ceiling and the juggling also explains the sword which it was mr todhunter's professional pride and duty to swallow but again being at the stage of practice he very slightly grazed the inside of his throat with the weapon hence he has a wound inside him which i am sure from the expression on his face is not a serious one he was also practising the trick of a release from ropes like the davenport brothers and he was just about to free himself when we all burst into the room the cards of course are for card tricks and they are scattered on the floor because he had just been practising one of those dodges of sending them flying through the air he merely kept his trade secret because he had to keep his tricks secret like any other conjurer but the mere fact of an idler in a top hat having once looked in at his back window and been driven away by him with great indignation was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance and make us imagine his whole life overshadowed by the silk hatted spectre of mr glass but what about the two voices asked maggie staring have you never heard a ventriloquist asked father brown don't you know they speak first in their natural voice and then answer themselves in just that shrill squeaky unnatural voice that you heard there was a long silence and dr hood regarded the little man who had spoken with a dark and attentive smile you are certainly a very ingenious person he said it could not have been done better in a book but there is just one part of mr glass you have not succeeded in explaining away and that is his name miss macnab distinctly heard him so addressed by mr todhunter the rev mr brown broke into a rather childish giggle well that he said that's the silliest part of the whole silly story when our juggling friend here threw up the three glasses in turn he counted them aloud as he caught them and also commented aloud when he failed to catch them what he really said was one two and three missed a glass one two missed a glass and so on there was a second of stillness in the room and then everyone with one accord burst out laughing as they did so the figure in the corner complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall with a flourish then advancing into the middle of the room with a bow he produced from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red which announced that zaladin the world's greatest conjurer contortionist ventriloquist and human kangaroo would be ready with an entirely new series of tricks at the empire pavilion scarborough on monday next at eight o'clock precisely two the paradise of thieves the great muscari most original of the young tuscan poets walked swiftly into his favourite restaurant which overlooked the mediterranean was covered by an awning and fenced by little lemon and orange trees waiters in white aprons were already laying out on white tables the insignia of an early and elegant lunch and this seemed to increase a satisfaction that already touched the top of swagger muscari had an eagle nose like dante his hair and neckerchief were dark and flowing he carried a black cloak and might almost have carried a black mask so much did he bear with him a sort of venetian melodrama he acted as if a troubadour had still a definite social office like a bishop he went as near as his century permitted to walking the world literally like don juan with rapier and guitar for he never travelled without a case of swords with which he had fought many brilliant duels or without a corresponding case for his mandolin with which he had actually serenaded miss ethel harrogate the highly conventional daughter of a yorkshire banker on a holiday yet he was neither a charlatan nor a child but a hot logical latin who liked a certain thing and was it his poetry was as straightforward as anyone else's prose he desired fame or wine or the beauty of women with a torrid directness inconceivable among the cloudy ideals or cloudy compromises of the north to vaguer races his intensity smelt of danger or even crime like fire or the sea he was too simple to be trusted the banker and his beautiful english daughter were staying at the hotel attached to muscari's restaurant that was why it was his favourite restaurant a glance flashed around the room told him at once however that the english party had not descended the restaurant was glittering but still comparatively empty two priests were talking at a table in a corner but muscari an ardent catholic took no more notice of them than of a couple of crows but from a yet farther seat partly concealed behind a dwarf tree golden with oranges there rose and advanced towards the poet a person whose costume was the most aggressively opposite to his own this figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check with a pink tie a sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots he contrived in the true tradition of arry at margate to look at once startling and commonplace but as the cockney apparition drew nearer muscari was astounded to observe that the head was distinctly different from the body it was an italian head fuzzy swarthy and very vivacious that rose abruptly out of the standing collar like cardboard and the comic pink tie in fact it was a head he knew he recognized it above all the dire erection of english holiday array as the face of an old but forgotten friend name ezza this youth had been a prodigy at college and european fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen but when he appeared in the world he failed first publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue and then privately for years on end as an actor a traveller a commission agent or a journalist muscari had known him last behind the footlights he was but too well attuned to the excitements of that profession and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up ezza cried the poet rising and shaking hands in a pleasant astonishment well i've seen you in many costumes in the green room but i never expected to see you dressed up as an englishman this answered ezza gravely is not the costume of an englishman but of the italian of the future in that case remarked muscari i confess i prefer the italian of the past that is your old mistake muscari said the man in tweeds shaking his head and the mistake of italy in the sixteenth century we tuscans made the morning we had the newest steel the newest carving the newest chemistry why should we not now have the newest factories the newest motors the newest finance the newest clothes because they are not worth having answered muscari you cannot make italians really progressive they are too intelligent men who see the short cut to good living will never go by the new elaborate roads well to me marconi or d'annunzio is the star of italy said the other that is why i have become a futurist and a courier a courier cried muscari laughing is that the last of your list of trades and whom are you conducting oh a man of the name of harrogate and his family i believe not the banker in this hotel inquired the poet with some eagerness that's the man answered the courier does it pay well asked the troubadour innocently it will pay me said ezza with a very enigmatic smile but i am a rather curious sort of courier then as if changing the subject he said abruptly he has a daughter and a son the daughter is divine affirmed muscari the father and son are i suppose human but granted his harmless qualities doesn't that banker strike you as a splendid instance of my argument harrogate has millions in his safes and i have the hole in my pocket but you daren't say you can't say that he's cleverer than i or bolder than i or even more energetic he's not clever he's got eyes like blue buttons he's not energetic he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic he's a conscientious kindly old blockhead but he's got money simply because he collects money as a boy collects stamps you're too strong minded for business ezza you won't get on to be clever enough to get all that money one must be stupid enough to want it i'm stupid enough for that said ezza gloomily but i should suggest a suspension of your critique of the banker for here he comes mr harrogate the great financier did indeed enter the room but nobody looked at him he was a massive elderly man with a boiled blue eye and faded grey sandy moustaches but for his heavy stoop he might have been a colonel he carried several unopened letters in his hand his son frank was a really fine lad curly haired sun burnt and strenuous but nobody looked at him either all eyes as usual were riveted for the moment at least upon ethel harrogate whose golden greek head and colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea like a goddess's the poet muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drinking something as indeed he was he was drinking the classic which his fathers made ezza studied her with a gaze equally intense and far more baffling miss harrogate was specially radiant and ready for conversation on this occasion and her family had fallen into the easier continental habit allowing the stranger muscari and even the courier ezza to share their table and their talk in ethel harrogate conventionality crowned itself with a perfection and splendour of its own proud of her father's prosperity fond of fashionable pleasures a fond daughter but an arrant flirt she was all these things with a sort of golden good nature that made her very pride pleasing and her worldly respectability a fresh and hearty thing they were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril in the mountain path they were to attempt that week the danger was not from rock and avalanche but from something yet more romantic ethel had been earnestly assured that brigands the true cut throats of the modern legend still haunted that ridge and held that pass of the apennines they say she cried with the awful relish of a schoolgirl that all that country isn't ruled by the king of italy but by the king of thieves who is the king of thieves a great man replied muscari worthy to rank with your own robin hood signorina montano the king of thieves was first heard of in the mountains some ten years ago when people said brigands were extinct but his wild authority spread with the swiftness of a silent revolution men found his fierce proclamations nailed in every mountain village his sentinels gun in hand in every mountain ravine six times the italian government tried to dislodge him and was defeated in six pitched battles as if by napoleon now that sort of thing observed the banker weightily would never be allowed in england perhaps after all we had better choose another route but the courier thought it perfectly safe it is perfectly safe said the courier contemptuously i have been over it twenty times there may have been some old jailbird called a king in the time of our grandmothers but he belongs to history if not to fable brigandage is utterly stamped out it can never be utterly stamped out muscari answered because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners our peasants are like their mountains rich in grace and green gaiety but with the fires beneath there is a point of human despair where the northern poor take to drink and our own poor take to daggers a poet is privileged replied ezza with a sneer if signor muscari were english he would still be looking for highwaymen in wandsworth believe me there is no more danger of being captured in italy than of being scalped in boston then you propose to attempt it asked mr harrogate frowning oh it sounds rather dreadful cried the girl turning her glorious eyes on muscari do you really think the pass is dangerous muscari threw back his black mane i know it is dangerous he said i am crossing it tomorrow the young harrogate was left behind for a moment emptying a glass of white wine and lighting a cigarette as the beauty retired with the banker the courier and the poet distributing peals of silvery satire at about the same instant the two priests in the corner rose the taller a white haired italian taking his leave the shorter priest turned and walked towards the banker's son and the latter was astonished to realize that though a roman priest the man was an englishman he vaguely remembered meeting him at the social crushes of some of his catholic friends but the man spoke before his memories could collect themselves mr frank harrogate i think he said i have had an introduction but i do not mean to presume on it the odd thing i have to say will come far better from a stranger mr harrogate i say one word and go take care of your sister in her great sorrow even for frank's truly fraternal indifference the radiance and derision of his sister still seemed to sparkle and ring he could hear her laughter still from the garden of the hotel and he stared at his sombre adviser in puzzledom do you mean the brigands he asked and then remembering a vague fear of his own or can you be thinking of muscari one is never thinking of the real sorrow said the strange priest one can only be kind when it comes and he passed promptly from the room leaving the other almost with his mouth open a day or two afterwards a coach containing the company was really crawling and staggering up the spurs of the menacing mountain range between ezza's cheery denial of the danger and muscari's boisterous defiance of it the financial family were firm in their original purpose and muscari made his mountain journey coincide with theirs a more surprising feature was the appearance at the coast town station of the little priest of the restaurant he alleged merely that business led him also to cross the mountains of the midland but young harrogate could not but connect his presence with the mystical fears and warnings of yesterday the coach was a kind of commodious wagonette invented by the modernist talent of the courier who dominated the expedition with his scientific activity and breezy wit the theory of danger from thieves was banished from thought and speech though so far conceded in formal act that some slight protection was employed the courier and the young banker carried loaded revolvers and muscari with much boyish gratification buckled on a kind of cutlass under his black cloak he had planted his person at a flying leap next to the lovely englishwoman on the other side of her sat the priest whose name was brown and who was fortunately a silent individual the courier and the father and son were on the banc behind muscari was in towering spirits seriously believing in the peril and his talk to ethel might well have made her think him a maniac but there was something in the crazy and gorgeous ascent amid crags like peaks loaded with woods like orchards that dragged her spirit up alone with his into purple preposterous heavens with wheeling suns the white road climbed like a white cat it spanned sunless chasms like a tight rope it was flung round far off headlands like a lasso and yet however high they went the desert still blossomed like the rose the fields were burnished in sun and wind with the colour of kingfisher and parrot and humming bird the hues of a hundred flowering flowers there are no lovelier meadows and woodlands than the english no nobler crests or chasms than those of snowdon and glencoe but ethel harrogate had never before seen the southern parks tilted on the splintered northern peaks the gorge of glencoe laden with the fruits of kent there was nothing here of that chill and desolation that in britain one associates with high and wild scenery it was rather like a mosaic palace rent with earthquakes or like a dutch tulip garden blown to the stars with dynamite it's like kew gardens on beachy head said ethel it is our secret answered he the secret of the volcano that is also the secret of the revolution that a thing can be violent and yet fruitful you are rather violent yourself and she smiled at him and yet rather fruitless he admitted if i die tonight i die unmarried and a fool it is not my fault if you have come she said after a difficult silence it is never your fault answered muscari it was not your fault that troy fell as they spoke they came under overwhelming cliffs that spread almost like wings above a corner of peculiar peril shocked by the big shadow on the narrow ledge the horses stirred doubtfully the driver leapt to the earth to hold their heads and they became ungovernable one horse reared up to his full height the titanic and terrifying height of a horse when he becomes a biped it was just enough to alter the equilibrium the whole coach heeled over like a ship and crashed through the fringe of bushes over the cliff muscari threw an arm round ethel who clung to him and shouted aloud it was for such moments that he lived at the moment when the gorgeous mountain walls went round the poet's head like a purple windmill a thing happened which was superficially even more startling the elderly and lethargic banker sprang erect in the coach and leapt over the precipice before the tilted vehicle could take him there in the first flash it looked as wild as suicide but in the second it was as sensible as a safe investment the yorkshireman had evidently more promptitude as well as more sagacity than muscari had given him credit for for he landed in a lap of land which might have been specially padded with turf and clover to receive him as it happened indeed the whole company were equally lucky if less dignified in their form of ejection immediately under this abrupt turn of the road was a grassy and flowery hollow like a sunken meadow a sort of green velvet pocket in the long green trailing garments of the hills into this they were all tipped or tumbled with little damage save that their smallest baggage and even the contents of their pockets were scattered in the grass around them the wrecked coach still hung above entangled in the tough hedge and the horses plunged painfully down the slope the first to sit up was the little priest who scratched his head with a face of foolish wonder frank harrogate heard him say to himself now why on earth have we fallen just here he blinked at the litter around him and recovered his own very clumsy umbrella beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from the head of muscari and beside it a sealed business letter which after a glance at the address he returned to the elder harrogate on the other side of him the grass partly hid miss ethel's sunshade and just beyond it lay a curious little glass bottle hardly two inches long the priest picked it up in a quick unobtrusive manner he uncorked and sniffed it and his heavy face turned the colour of clay heaven deliver us he muttered it can't be hers has her sorrow come on her already he slipped it into his own waistcoat pocket i think i'm justified he said till i know a little more he gazed painfully at the girl at that moment being raised out of the flowers by muscari who was saying we have fallen into heaven it is a sign mortals climb up and they fall down but it is only gods and goddesses who can fall upwards and indeed she rose out of the sea of colours so beautiful and happy a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shifted after all he thought perhaps the poison isn't hers perhaps it's one of muscari's melodramatic tricks muscari set the lady lightly on her feet made her an absurdly theatrical bow and then drawing his cutlass hacked hard at the taut reins of the horses so that they scrambled to their feet and stood in the grass trembling when he had done so a most remarkable thing occurred a very quiet man very poorly dressed and extremely sunburnt came out of the bushes and took hold of the horses heads he had a queer shaped knife very broad and crooked buckled on his belt there was nothing else remarkable about him except his sudden and silent appearance the poet asked him who he was and he did not answer looking around him at the confused and startled group in the hollow muscari then perceived that another tanned and tattered man with a short gun under his arm was looking at them from the ledge just below leaning his elbows on the edge of the turf then he looked up at the road from which they had fallen and saw looking down on them the muzzles of four other carbines and four other brown faces with bright but quite motionless eyes the brigands cried muscari with a kind of monstrous gaiety this was a trap ezza if you will oblige me by shooting the coachman first we can cut our way out yet there are only six of them the coachman said ezza who was standing grimly with his hands in his pockets happens to be a servant of mr harrogate's then shoot him all the more cried the poet impatiently he was bribed to upset his master then put the lady in the middle and we will break the line up there with a rush and wading in wild grass and flowers he advanced fearlessly on the four carbines but finding that no one followed except young harrogate he turned brandishing his cutlass to wave the others on he beheld the courier still standing slightly astride in the centre of the grassy ring his hands in his pockets and his lean ironical italian face seemed to grow longer and longer in the evening light you thought muscari i was the failure among our schoolfellows he said and you thought you were the success but i have succeeded more than you and fill a bigger place in history i have been acting epics while you have been writing them come on i tell you thundered muscari from above will you stand there talking nonsense about yourself with a woman to save and three strong men to help you what do you call yourself i call myself montano cried the strange courier in a voice equally loud and full i am the king of thieves and i welcome you all to my summer palace and even as he spoke five more silent men with weapons ready came out of the bushes and looked towards him for their orders one of them held a large paper in his hand this pretty little nest where we are all picnicking went on the courier brigand with the same easy yet sinister smile is together with some caves underneath it known by the name of the paradise of thieves it is my principal stronghold on these hills for as you have doubtless noticed the eyrie is invisible both from the road above and from the valley below it is something better than impregnable it is unnoticeable here i mostly live and here i shall certainly die if the gendarmes ever track me here i am not the kind of criminal that reserves his defence but the better kind that reserves his last bullet all were staring at him thunderstruck and still except father brown who heaved a huge sigh as of relief and fingered the little phial in his pocket thank god he muttered that's much more probable the poison belongs to this robber chief of course he carries it so that he may never be captured like cato the king of thieves was however continuing his address with the same kind of dangerous politeness it only remains for me he said to explain to my guests the social conditions upon which i have the pleasure of entertaining them i need not expound the quaint old ritual of ransom which it is incumbent upon me to keep up and even this only applies to a part of the company the reverend father brown and the celebrated signor muscari i shall release tomorrow at dawn and escort to my outposts poets and priests if you will pardon my simplicity of speech never have any money and so since it is impossible to get anything out of them let us seize the opportunity to show our admiration for classic literature and our reverence for holy church he paused with an unpleasing smile and father brown blinked repeatedly at him and seemed suddenly to be listening with great attention the brigand captain took the large paper from the attendant brigand and glancing over it continued my other intentions are clearly set forth in this public document which i will hand round in a moment and which after that will be posted on a tree by every village in the valley and every cross road in the hills i will not weary you with the verbalism since you will be able to check it the substance of my proclamation is this i announce first that i have captured the english millionaire the colossus of finance mr samuel harrogate i next announce that i have found on his person notes and bonds for two thousand pounds which he has given up to me now since it would be really immoral to announce such a thing to a credulous public if it had not occurred i suggest it should occur without further delay i suggest that mr harrogate senior should now give me the two thousand pounds in his pocket the banker looked at him under lowering brows red faced and sulky but seemingly cowed that leap from the failing carriage seemed to have used up his last virility he had held back in a hang dog style when his son and muscari had made a bold movement to break out of the brigand trap and now his red and trembling hand went reluctantly to his breast pocket and passed a bundle of papers and envelopes to the brigand excellent cried that outlaw gaily so far we are all cosy i resume the points of my proclamation so soon to be published to all italy the third item is that of ransom i am asking from the friends of the harrogate family a ransom of three thousand pounds which i am sure is almost insulting to that"
