"1" "chill self reproach that she had not returned sooner to help her mother in these domesticities instead of indulging herself out of doors there stood her mother amid the group of children as tess had left her hanging over the monday washing tub which had now as always lingered on to the end of the week out of that tub had come the day before tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse the very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass which had been wrung up and ironed by her mother's own hands as usual mrs durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest child the cradle rockers had done hard duty for so many years under the weight of so many children on that flagstone floor that they were worn nearly flat in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each swing of the cot flinging the baby from side to side like a weaver's shuttle as mrs durbeyfield excited by her song trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after a long day's seething in the suds nick knock nick knock went the cradle the candle flame stretched itself tall and began jigging up and down the water dribbled from the matron's elbows and the song galloped on to the end of the verse mrs durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while even now when burdened with a young family joan durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune no ditty floated into blackmoor vale from the outer world but tess's mother caught up its notation in a week there still faintly beamed from the woman's features something of the freshness and even the prettiness of her youth rendering it probable that the personal charms which tess could boast of were in main part her mother's gift and therefore unknightly unhistorical i'll rock the cradle for ee mother said the daughter gently or i'll take off my best frock and help you wring up i thought you had finished long ago her mother bore tess no ill will for leaving the housework to her single handed efforts for so long indeed joan seldom upbraided her thereon at any time feeling but slightly the lack of tess's assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in postponing them to night however she was even in a blither mood than usual there was a dreaminess a pre occupation an exaltation in the maternal look which the girl could not understand well i'm glad you've come her mother said as soon as the last note had passed out of her i want to go and fetch your father but what's more'n that i want to tell ee what have happened y'll be fess enough my poppet when th'st know mrs durbeyfield habitually spoke the dialect her daughter who had passed the sixth standard in the national school under a london trained mistress spoke two languages the dialect at home more or less ordinary english abroad and to persons of quality since i've been away tess asked ay had it anything to do with father's making such a mommet of himself in thik carriage this afternoon why did er i felt inclined to sink into the ground with shame that wer all a part of the larry we've been found to be the greatest gentlefolk in the whole county reaching all back long before oliver grumble's time to the days of the pagan turks with monuments and vaults and crests and scutcheons and the lord knows what all in saint charles's days we was made knights o the royal oak our real name being d'urberville don't that make your bosom plim twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee not because he'd been drinking as people supposed i'm glad of that will it do us any good mother o yes tis thoughted that great things may come o't no doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as tis known your father learnt it on his way hwome from shaston and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter where is father now asked tess suddenly her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer he called to see the doctor to day in shaston it is not consumption at all it seems it is fat round his heart a says there it is like this joan durbeyfield as she spoke curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter c and used the other forefinger as a pointer at the present moment he says to your father your heart is enclosed all round there and all round there this space is still open a says as soon as it do meet so mrs durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete off you will go like a shadder mr durbeyfield a says you mid last ten years you mid go off in ten months or ten days tess looked alarmed her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud so soon notwithstanding this sudden greatness but where is father she asked again her mother put on a deprecating look now don't you be bursting out angry the poor man he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the pa'son's news that he went up to rolliver's half an hour ago he do want to get up his strength for his journey to morrow with that load of beehives which must be delivered family or no he'll have to start shortly after twelve to night as the distance is so long get up his strength said tess impetuously the tears welling to her eyes o my god go to a public house to get up his strength and you as well agreed as he mother her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room and to impart a cowed look to the furniture and candle and children playing about and to her mother's face no said the latter touchily i be not agreed i have been waiting for ee to bide and keep house while i go fetch him i'll go o no tess you see it would be no use tess did not expostulate she knew what her mother's objection meant mrs durbeyfield's jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a chair by her side in readiness for this contemplated jaunt the reason for which the matron deplored more than its necessity and take the _compleat fortune teller_ to the outhouse joan continued rapidly wiping her hands and donning the garments the _compleat fortune teller_ was an old thick volume which lay on a table at her elbow so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached the edge of the type tess took it up and her mother started this going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of mrs durbeyfield's still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing children to discover him at rolliver's to sit there for an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during the interval made her happy a sort of halo an occidental glow came over life then troubles and other realities took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene contemplation and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed body and soul the youngsters not immediately within sight seemed rather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise the incidents of daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there she felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing shutting her eyes to his defects of character and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as lover tess being left alone with the younger children went first to the outhouse with the fortune telling book and stuffed it into the thatch a curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted between the mother with her fast perishing lumber of superstitions folk lore dialect and orally transmitted ballads and the daughter with her trained national teachings and standard knowledge under an infinitely revised code there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily understood when they were together the jacobean and the victorian ages were juxtaposed returning along the garden path tess mused on what the mother could have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day she guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it but did not divine that it solely concerned herself dismissing this however she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the day time in company with her nine year old brother abraham and her sister eliza louisa of twelve and a half called liza lu the youngest ones being put to bed there was an interval of four years and more between tess and the next of the family the two who had filled the gap having died in their infancy and this lent her a deputy maternal attitude when she was alone with her juniors next in juvenility to abraham came two more girls hope and modesty then a boy of three and then the baby who had just completed his first year all these young souls were passengers in the durbeyfield ship entirely dependent on the judgement of the two durbeyfield adults for their pleasures their necessities their health even their existence if the heads of the durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty disaster starvation disease degradation death thither were these half dozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with them six helpless creatures who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of durbeyfield some people would like to know whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure gets his authority for speaking of nature's holy plan it grew later and neither father nor mother reappeared tess looked out of the door and took a mental journey through marlott the village was shutting its eyes candles and lamps were being put out everywhere she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand her mother's fetching simply meant one more to fetch tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood abraham she said to her little brother do you put on your hat you bain't afraid and go up to rolliver's and see what has gone wi father and mother the boy jumped promptly from his seat and opened the door and the night swallowed him up half an hour passed yet again neither man woman nor child returned abraham like his parents seemed to have been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn i must go myself she said liza lu then went to bed and tess locking them all in started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress a street laid out before inches of land had value and when one handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day iv rolliver's inn the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken village could only boast of an off licence hence as nobody could legally drink on the premises the amount of overt accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide and two yards long fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire so as to form a ledge on this board thirsty strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of polynesia and wished they could have a restful seat inside thus the strangers but there were also local customers who felt the same wish and where there's a will there's a way in a large bedroom upstairs the window of which was thickly curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady mrs rolliver were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons all seeking beatitude all old inhabitants of the nearer end of marlott and frequenters of this retreat not only did the distance to the the pure drop the fully licensed tavern at the further part of the dispersed village render its accommodation practically unavailable for dwellers at this end but the far more serious question the quality of the liquor confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink with rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house a gaunt four post bedstead which stood in the room afforded sitting space for several persons gathered round three of its sides a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers another rested on the oak carved cwoffer two on the wash stand another on the stool and thus all were somehow seated at their ease the stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins and spread their personalities warmly through the room in this process the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry the brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers and the carved bedposts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent pillars of solomon's temple mrs durbeyfield having quickly walked hitherward after parting from tess opened the front door crossed the downstairs room which was in deep gloom and then unfastened the stair door like one whose fingers knew the tricks of the latches well her ascent of the crooked staircase was a slower process and her face as it rose into the light above the last stair encountered the gaze of all the party assembled in the bedroom being a few private friends i've asked in to keep up club walking at my own expense the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps as glibly as a child repeating the catechism while she peered over the stairs oh tis you mrs durbeyfield lard how you frightened me i thought it might be some gaffer sent by gover'ment mrs durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of the conclave and turned to where her husband sat he was humming absently to himself in a low tone i be as good as some folks here and there i've got a great family vault at kingsbere sub greenhill and finer skillentons than any man in wessex i've something to tell ee that's come into my head about that a grand projick whispered his cheerful wife here john don't ee see me she nudged him while he looking through her as through a window pane went on with his recitative hush don't ee sing so loud my good man said the landlady in case any member of the gover'ment should be passing and take away my licends he's told ee what's happened to us i suppose asked mrs durbeyfield yes in a way d'ye think there's any money hanging by it ah that's the secret said joan durbeyfield sagely however tis well to be kin to a coach even if you don't ride in en she dropped her public voice and continued in a low tone to her husband i've been thinking since you brought the news that there's a great rich lady out by trantridge on the edge o the chase of the name of d'urberville hey what's that said sir john she repeated the information that lady must be our relation she said and my projick is to send tess to claim kin there is a lady of the name now you mention it said durbeyfield pa'son tringham didn't think of that but she's nothing beside we a junior branch of us no doubt hailing long since king norman's day while this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed in their preoccupation that little abraham had crept into the room and was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return she is rich and she'd be sure to take notice o the maid continued mrs durbeyfield and twill be a very good thing i don't see why two branches o one family should not be on visiting terms yes and we'll all claim kin said abraham brightly from under the bedstead and we'll all go and see her when tess has gone to live with her and we'll ride in her coach and wear black clothes how do you come here child what nonsense be ye talking go away and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready well tess ought to go to this other member of our family she'd be sure to win the lady tess would and likely enough twould lead to some noble gentleman marrying her in short i know it how i tried her fate in the _fortune teller_ and it brought out that very thing you should ha seen how pretty she looked to day her skin is as sumple as a duchess what says the maid herself to going i've not asked her she don't know there is any such lady relation yet but it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage and she won't say nay to going tess is queer but she's tractable at bottom leave her to me though this conversation had been private sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had and that tess their pretty eldest daughter had fine prospects in store tess is a fine figure o fun as i said to myself to day when i zeed her vamping round parish with the rest observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone but joan durbeyfield must mind that she don't get green malt in floor it was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning and there was no reply the conversation became inclusive and presently other footsteps were heard crossing the room below being a few private friends asked in to night to keep up club walking at my own expense the landlady had rapidly re used the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was tess even to her mother's gaze the girl's young features looked sadly out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middle age and hardly was a reproachful flash from tess's dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their seats hastily finish their ale and descend the stairs behind her mrs rolliver's caution following their footsteps no noise please if ye'll be so good my dears or i mid lose my licends and be summons'd and i don't know what all night t'ye they went home together tess holding one arm of her father and mrs durbeyfield the other he had in truth drunk very little not a fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections but the weakness of sir john's constitution made mountains of his petty sins in this kind on reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were marching to london and at another as if they were marching to bath which produced a comical effect frequent enough in families on nocturnal homegoings and like most comical effects not quite so comic after all the two women valiantly disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they could from durbeyfield their cause and from abraham and from themselves and so they approached by degrees their own door the head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence i've got a fam ily vault at kingsbere hush don't be so silly jacky said his wife yours is not the only family that was of count in wold days look at the anktells and horseys and the tringhams themselves gone to seed a'most as much as you though you was bigger folks than they that's true thank god i was never of no family and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way don't you be so sure o that from you nater tis my belief you've disgraced yourselves more than any o us and was kings and queens outright at one time tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry i am afraid father won't be able to take the journey with the beehives to morrow so early i i shall be all right in an hour or two said durbeyfield it was eleven o'clock before the family were all in bed and two o'clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in casterbridge before the saturday market began the way thither lying by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles and the horse and waggon being of the slowest at half past one mrs durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept the poor man can't go she said to her eldest daughter whose great eyes had opened the moment her mother's hand touched the door tess sat up in bed lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this information but somebody must go she replied it is late for the hives already swarming will soon be over for the year and it we put off taking em till next week's market the call for em will be past and they'll be thrown on our hands mrs durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency some young feller perhaps would go one of them who were so much after dancing with ee yesterday she presently suggested o no i wouldn't have it for the world declared tess proudly and letting everybody know the reason such a thing to be ashamed of i think _i_ could go if abraham could go with me to kip me company her mother at length agreed to this arrangement little abraham was aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment and made to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world meanwhile tess had hastily dressed herself and the twain lighting a lantern went out to the stable the rickety little waggon was already laden and the girl led out the horse prince only a degree less rickety than the vehicle the poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night at the lantern at their two figures as if he could not believe that at that hour when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at rest he was called upon to go out and labour they put a stock of candle ends into the lantern hung the latter to the off side of the load and directed the horse onward walking at his shoulder at first during the uphill parts of the way in order not to overload an animal of so little vigour to cheer themselves as well as they could they made an artificial morning with the lantern some bread and butter and their own conversation the real morning being far from come abraham as he more fully awoke for he had moved in a sort of trance so far began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects against the sky of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing from a lair of that which resembled a giant's head when they had passed the little town of stourcastle dumbly somnolent under its thick brown thatch they reached higher ground still higher on their left the elevation called bulbarrow or bealbarrow well nigh the highest in south wessex swelled into the sky engirdled by its earthen trenches from hereabout the long road was fairly level for some distance onward they mounted in front of the waggon and abraham grew reflective tess he said in a preparatory tone after a silence yes abraham bain't you glad that we've become gentlefolk not particular glad but you be glad that you m going to marry a gentleman what said tess lifting her face that our great relation will help ee to marry a gentleman i our great relation we have no such relation what has put that into your head i heard em talking about it up at rolliver's when i went to find father there's a rich lady of our family out at trantridge and mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady she'd put ee in the way of marrying a gentleman his sister became abruptly still and lapsed into a pondering silence abraham talked on rather for the pleasure of utterance than for audition so that his sister's abstraction was of no account he leant back against the hives and with upturned face made observations on the stars whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above in serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life he asked how far away those twinklers were and whether god was on the other side of them but ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation if tess were made rich by marrying a gentleman would she have money enough to buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as nettlecombe tout the renewed subject which seemed to have impregnated the whole family filled tess with impatience never mind that now she exclaimed did you say the stars were worlds tess yes all like ours i don't know but i think so they sometimes seem to be like the apples on our stubbard tree most of them splendid and sound a few blighted which do we live on a splendid one or a blighted one a blighted one tis very unlucky that we didn't pitch on a sound one when there were so many more of em yes is it like that really tess said abraham turning to her much impressed on reconsideration of this rare information how would it have been if we had pitched on a sound one well father wouldn't have coughed and creeped about as he does and wouldn't have got too tipsy to go on this journey and mother wouldn't have been always washing and never getting finished and you would have been a rich lady ready made and not have had to be made rich by marrying a gentleman o aby don't don't talk of that any more left to his reflections abraham soon grew drowsy tess was not skilful in the management of a horse but she thought that she could take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so she made him a sort of nest in front of the hives in such a manner that he could not fall and taking the reins into her own hands jogged on as before prince required but slight attention lacking energy for superfluous movements of any sort with no longer a companion to distract her tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever her back leaning against the hives the mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality and the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul conterminous with the universe in space and with history in time then examining the mesh of events in her own life she seemed to see the vanity of her father's pride the gentlemanly suitor awaiting herself in her mother's fancy to see him as a grimacing personage laughing at her poverty and her shrouded knightly ancestry everything grew more and more extravagant and she no longer knew how time passed a sudden jerk shook her in her seat and tess awoke from the sleep into which she too had fallen they were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness and the waggon had stopped a hollow groan unlike anything she had ever heard in her life came from the front followed by a shout of hoi there the lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out but another was shining in her face much brighter than her own had been something terrible had happened the harness was entangled with an object which blocked the way in consternation tess jumped down and discovered the dreadful truth the groan had proceeded from her father's poor horse prince the morning mail cart with its two noiseless"
