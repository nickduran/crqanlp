"1" "in my gray face faces fair shone from under shining hair well i saw the poising head but the lips moved and nothing said and when lights were in the hall silent moved the dancers all so awhile i glowed and then fell on dusty days and men long i slumbered packed in straw long i none but dealers saw till before my silent eye one that sees came passing by now with an outlandish grace to the sparkling fire i face in the blue room at skerryvore where i wait until the door open and the prince of men henry james shall come again xix katharine we see you as we see a face that trembles in a forest place upon the mirror of a pool forever quiet clear and cool and in the wayward glass appears to hover between smiles and tears elfin and human airy and true and backed by the reflected blue xx to f j s i read dear friend in your dear face your life’s tale told with perfect grace the river of your life i trace up the sun chequered devious bed to the far distant fountain head not one quick beat of your warm heart nor thought that came to you apart pleasure nor pity love nor pain nor sorrow has gone by in vain but as some lone wood wandering child brings home with him at evening mild the thorns and flowers of all the wild from your whole life o fair and true your flowers and thorns you bring with you xxi requiem under the wide and starry sky dig the grave and let me lie glad did i live and gladly die and i laid me down with a will this be the verse you grave for me _here he lies where he longed to be_ _home is the sailor_ _home from sea_ _and the hunter home from the hill_ xxii the celestial surgeon if i have faltered more or less in my great task of happiness if i have moved among my race and shown no glorious morning face if beams from happy human eyes have moved me not if morning skies books and my food and summer rain knocked on my sullen heart in vain lord thy most pointed pleasure take and stab my spirit broad awake or lord if too obdurate i choose thou before that spirit die a piercing pain a killing sin and to my dead heart run them in xxiii our lady of the snows out of the sun out of the blast out of the world alone i passed across the moor and through the wood to where the monastery stood there neither lute nor breathing fife nor rumour of the world of life nor confidences low and dear shall strike the meditative ear aloof unhelpful and unkind the prisoners of the iron mind where nothing speaks except the hell the unfraternal brothers dwell poor passionate men still clothed afresh with agonising folds of flesh whom the clear eyes solicit still to some bold output of the will while fairy fancy far before and musing memory hold the door now to heroic death invite and now uncurtain fresh delight o little boots it thus to dwell on the remote unneighboured hill o to be up and doing o unfearing and unshamed to go in all the uproar and the press about my human business my undissuaded heart i hear whisper courage in my ear with voiceless calls the ancient earth summons me to a daily birth thou o my love ye o my friends the gist of life the end of ends to laugh to love to live to die ye call me by the ear and eye forth from the casemate on the plain where honour has the world to gain pour forth and bravely do your part o knights of the unshielded heart forth and forever forward out from prudent turret and redoubt and in the mellay charge amain to fall but yet to rise again captive ah still to honour bright a captive soldier of the right or free and fighting good with ill unconquering but unconquered still and ye o brethren what if god when from heav’n’s top he spies abroad and sees on this tormented stage the noble war of mankind rage what if his vivifying eye o monks should pass your corner by for still the lord is lord of might in deeds in deeds he takes delight the plough the spear the laden barks the field the founded city marks he marks the smiler of the streets the singer upon garden seats he sees the climber in the rocks to him the shepherd folds his flocks for those he loves that underprop with daily virtues heaven’s top and bear the falling sky with ease unfrowning caryatides those he approves that ply the trade that rock the child that wed the maid that with weak virtues weaker hands sow gladness on the peopled lands and still with laughter song and shout spin the great wheel of earth about but ye o ye who linger still here in your fortress on the hill with placid face with tranquil breath the unsought volunteers of death our cheerful general on high with careless looks may pass you by xxiv not yet my soul these friendly fields desert where thou with grass and rivers and the breeze and the bright face of day thy dalliance hadst where to thine ear first sang the enraptured birds where love and thou that lasting bargain made the ship rides trimmed and from the eternal shore thou hearest airy voices but not yet depart my soul not yet awhile depart freedom is far rest far thou art with life too closely woven nerve with nerve intwined service still craving service love for love love for dear love still suppliant with tears alas not yet thy human task is done a bond at birth is forged a debt doth lie immortal on mortality it grows by vast rebound it grows unceasing growth gift upon gift alms upon alms upreared from man from god from nature till the soul at that so huge indulgence stands amazed leave not my soul the unfoughten field nor leave thy debts dishonoured nor thy place desert without due service rendered for thy life up spirit and defend that fort of clay thy body now beleaguered whether soon or late she fall whether to day thy friends bewail thee dead or after years a man grown old in honour and the friend of peace contend my soul for moments and for hours each is with service pregnant each reclaimed is as a kingdom conquered where to reign as when a captain rallies to the fight his scattered legions and beats ruin back he on the field encamps well pleased in mind yet surely him shall fortune overtake him smite in turn headlong his ensigns drive and that dear land now safe to morrow fall but he unthinking in the present good solely delights and all the camps rejoice xxv it is not yours o mother to complain not mother yours to weep though nevermore your son again shall to your bosom creep though nevermore again you watch your baby sleep though in the greener paths of earth mother and child no more we wander and no more the birth of me whom once you bore seems still the brave reward that once it seemed of yore though as all passes day and night the seasons and the years from you o mother this delight this also disappears some profit yet survives of all your pangs and tears the child the seed the grain of corn the acorn on the hill each for some separate end is born in season fit and still each must in strength arise to work the almighty will so from the hearth the children flee by that almighty hand austerely led so one by sea goes forth and one by land nor aught of all man’s sons escapes from that command so from the sally each obeys the unseen almighty nod so till the ending all their ways blindfolded loth have trod nor knew their task at all but were the tools of god and as the fervent smith of yore beat out the glowing blade nor wielded in the front of war the weapons that he made but in the tower at home still plied his ringing trade so like a sword the son shall roam on nobler missions sent and as the smith remained at home in peaceful turret pent so sits the while at home the mother well content xxvi the sick child _child_ o mother lay your hand on my brow o mother mother where am i now why is the room so gaunt and great why am i lying awake so late _mother_ fear not at all the night is still nothing is here that means you ill nothing but lamps the whole town through and never a child awake but you _child_ mother mother speak low in my ear some of the things are so great and near some are so small and far away i have a fear that i cannot say what have i done and what do i fear and why are you crying mother dear _mother_ out in the city sounds begin thank the kind god the carts come in an hour or two more and god is so kind the day shall be blue in the window blind then shall my child go sweetly asleep and dream of the birds and the hills of sheep xxvii in memoriam f a s yet o stricken heart remember o remember how of human days he lived the better part april came to bloom and never dim december breathed its killing chills upon the head or heart doomed to know not winter only spring a being trod the flowery april blithely for a while took his fill of music joy of thought and seeing came and stayed and went nor ever ceased to smile came and stayed and went and now when all is finished you alone have crossed the melancholy stream yours the pang but his o his the undiminished undecaying gladness undeparted dream all that life contains of torture toil and treason shame dishonour death to him were but a name here a boy he dwelt through all the singing season and ere the day of sorrow departed as he came _davos_ 1881 xxviii to my father peace and her huge invasion to these shores puts daily home innumerable sails dawn on the far horizon and draw near innumerable loves uncounted hopes to our wild coasts not darkling now approach not now obscure since thou and thine are there and bright on the lone isle the foundered reef the long resounding foreland pharos stands these are thy works o father these thy crown whether on high the air be pure they shine along the yellowing sunset and all night among the unnumbered stars of god they shine or whether fogs arise and far and wide the low sea level drown each finds a tongue and all night long the tolling bell resounds so shine so toll till night be overpast till the stars vanish till the sun return and in the haven rides the fleet secure in the first hour the seaman in his skiff moves through the unmoving bay to where the town its earliest smoke into the air upbreathes and the rough hazels climb along the beach to the tugg’d oar the distant echo speaks the ship lies resting where by reef and roost thou and thy lights have led her like a child this hast thou done and i can i be base i must arise o father and to port some lost complaining seaman pilot home xxix in the states with half a heart i wander here as from an age gone by a brother yet though young in years an elder brother i you speak another tongue than mine though both were english born i towards the night of time decline you mount into the morn youth shall grow great and strong and free but age must still decay to morrow for the states for me england and yesterday _san francisco_ xxx a portrait i am a kind of farthing dip unfriendly to the nose and eyes a blue behinded ape i skip upon the trees of paradise at mankind’s feast i take my place in solemn sanctimonious state and have the air of saying grace while i defile the dinner plate i am the smiler with the knife the battener upon garbage i dear heaven with such a rancid life were it not better far to die yet still about the human pale i love to scamper love to race to swing by my irreverent tail all over the most holy place and when at length some golden day the unfailing sportsman aiming at shall bag me all the world shall say _thank god_ _and there’s an end of that_ xxxi sing clearlier muse or evermore be still sing truer or no longer sing no more the voice of melancholy jacques to wake a weeping echo in the hill but as the boy the pirate of the spring from the green elm a living linnet takes one natural verse recapture then be still xxxii a camp 66 the bed was made the room was fit by punctual eve the stars were lit the air was still the water ran no need was there for maid or man when we put up my ass and i at god’s green caravanserai xxxiii the country of the camisards 67 we travelled in the print of olden wars yet all the land was green and love we found and peace where fire and war had been they pass and smile the children of the sword no more the sword they wield and o how deep the corn along the battlefield xxxiv skerryvore for love of lovely words and for the sake of those my kinsmen and my countrymen who early and late in the windy ocean toiled to plant a star for seamen where was then the surfy haunt of seals and cormorants i on the lintel of this cot inscribe the name of a strong tower xxxv skerryvore the parallel here all is sunny and when the truant gull skims the green level of the lawn his wing dispetals roses here the house is framed of kneaded brick and the plumed mountain pine such clay as artists fashion and such wood as the tree climbing urchin breaks but there eternal granite hewn from the living isle and dowelled with brute iron rears a tower that from its wet foundation to its crown of glittering glass stands in the sweep of winds immovable immortal eminent xxxvi _my house_ i say but hark to the sunny doves that make my roof the arena of their loves that gyre about the gable all day long and fill the chimneys with their murmurous song _our house_ they say and _mine_ the cat declares and spreads his golden fleece upon the chairs and _mine_ the dog and rises stiff with wrath if any alien foot profane the path so too the buck that trimmed my terraces our whilome gardener called the garden his who now deposed surveys my plain abode and his late kingdom only from the road xxxvii my body which my dungeon is and yet my parks and palaces which is so great that there i go all the day long to and fro and when the night begins to fall throw down my bed and sleep while all the building hums with wakefulness even as a child of savages when evening takes her on her way she having roamed a summer’s day along the mountain sides and scalp sleeps in an antre of that alp which is so broad and high that there as in the topless fields of air my fancy soars like to a kite and faints in the blue infinite which is so strong my strongest throes and the rough world’s besieging blows not break it and so weak withal death ebbs and flows in its loose wall as the green sea in fishers nets and tops its topmost parapets which is so wholly mine that i can wield its whole artillery and mine so little that my soul dwells in perpetual control and i but think and speak and do as my dead fathers move me to if this born body of my bones the beggared soul so barely owns what money passed from hand to hand what creeping custom of the land what deed of author or assign can make a house a thing of mine xxxviii say not of me that weakly i declined the labours of my sires and fled the sea the towers we founded and the lamps we lit to play at home with paper like a child but rather say _in the afternoon of time_ _a strenuous family dusted from its hands_ _the sand of granite_ _and beholding far_ _along the sounding coast its pyramids_ _and tall memorials catch the

_note_ it may be guessed by some that i had a certain parish in my eye and this makes it proper i should add a word of disclamation in my time there have been two ministers in that parish of the first i have a special reason to speak well even had there been any to think ill the second i have often met in private and long in the due phrase sat under in his church and neither here nor there have i heard an unkind or ugly word upon his lips the preacher of the text had thus no original in that particular parish but when i was a boy he might have been observed in many others he was then like the schoolmaster abroad and by recent advices it would seem he has not yet entirely disappeared vi the spaewife o i wad like to ken to the beggar wife"
