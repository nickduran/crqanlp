"1" "had once been the abode of many very respectable families to use a popular word for respectable does not always mean worthy of respect on account of one's virtues but worthy of respect on account of one's lands houses and money in the former sense it was still occupied by very respectable families though none of them possessed much of the goods that perish in the using mrs redburn the seamstress was very respectable mrs colvin the washer woman was very respectable so were mrs howard the tailoress mr brown the lumper and mr sneed the mason katy's mother lived in a small house with three other families she occupied two rooms for which she paid four dollars a month the amount of rent now due and unpaid dr flynch took a great deal of pleasure in telling mrs redburn how his humanity and his regard for the welfare of the poor had induced him to fix the rent at so cheap a rate but he always finished by assuring her that this sum must be promptly paid and that no excuses could ever have any weight the next house to mrs redburn was tenanted by mr sneed the mason i don't know whether i ought to say that mr sneed had a son or that master simon sneed had a father being at a loss to determine which was the more important personage of the two but i am not going to say anything against either of them for the father was a very honest mason and the son was a very nice young man katy knocked at the door of this house and inquired for master simon sneed she was informed that he had not yet finished his dinner and she decided to wait in the court till he made his appearance seating herself on the door stone she permitted her mind to wander back to the narrative her mother had related to her she glanced at her coarse clothes and could hardly believe that her grandfather was a rich merchant and lived in a fine house how nice it would be if she could only find the old gentleman he could not be cross to her he would give her all the money she could spend and make a great lady of her pooh what a fool i am to think of such a thing exclaimed she impatiently as she rose from the door stone i am a beggar and what right have i to think of being a fine lady while my poor sick mother has nothing to eat and drink it is very hard to be so poor but i suppose it is all for the best do you want me katy said a voice from the door which katy recognized as that of master simon sneed i want to see you very much replied katy wait a moment and i will join you and in a moment master simon sneed did join her but he is so much of a curiosity and so much of a character that i must stop to tell my young readers all about him master simon sneed was about fifteen years old and tall enough to have been two years older he was very slim and held his head very straight in 1843 the period of which i write it was the fashion for gentlemen to wear straps upon their pantaloons and accordingly master simon sneed wore straps on his pantaloons though it is true the boys in the street used to laugh and hoot at him for doing so but they were very ill mannered boys and could not appreciate the dignity of him they insulted master sneed's garments were not of the finest materials but though he was a juvenile dandy it was evident that it required a great deal of personal labor to make him such clearly those straps were sewed on by himself and clearly those cowhide shoes had been thus elaborately polished by no other hands than his own in a word the appearance of his clothes coarse as was their texture and unfashionable as was their cut indicated the most scrupulous care it was plain that he had a fondness for dress which his circumstances did not permit him to indulge to any very great extent master simon sneed was a great man in his own estimation and as he had read a great many exciting novels and had a good command of language he talked and acted like a great man he could hold his own in conversation with older and wiser persons than himself he could astonish almost any person of moderate pretensions by the largeness of his ideas and of late years his father had not pretended to hold an argument with him for simon always overwhelmed him by the force and elegance of his rhetoric he spoke familiarly of great men and great events his business relations for master sneed was a business man were not very complicated according to his own reckoning he was the chief person in the employ of messrs sands co wholesale and retail dry good washington street one who had rendered immense service to the firm and one without whom the firm could not possibly get along a single day in short a sort of atlas on whose broad shoulders the vast world of the messrs sands co s affairs rested but according to the reckoning of the firm and the general understanding of people master simon was a boy in the store whose duty it was to make fires sweep out and carry bundles and in consideration of the fact that he boarded himself to receive two dollars and a half a week for his services there was a vast difference between master simon sneed's estimate of masters simon sneed and the messrs sands co s idea of master simon sneed but i beg my young friends not to let anything i have written create a prejudice against him for he was really a very kind hearted young man and under certain circumstances would have gone a great way to oblige a friend he had always been exceedingly well disposed towards katy perhaps it was because the simple hearted little girl used to be so much astonished when he told her about his mercantile relations with the firm of sands co and how he managed all their business for them after the store was closed at night and before the front door was unlocked in the morning how he went to the bank after immense sums of money and how the firm would have to give up business if he should die or be obliged to leave them katy believed that master simon was a great man and she wondered how his long slim arms could accomplish so much labor and how his small head could hold such a heap of magnificent ideas but master simon notwithstanding his elevated position in the firm was condescending to her he had more than once done her a favor and had always expressed a lively interest in her welfare therefore she did not scruple to apply to him in the present emergency well katy in what manner can i serve you inquired simon as he elevated his head and stood picking his teeth before her i want you to do something for me very much indeed state your business katy dr flynch has been to our house to day and wants the rent mother hasn't any money and you wish me to lend you the amount continued simon when katy hesitated to reveal the family trouble it is really unfortunate katy it is after bank hours now and i don't see that i can accommodate you o i don't want to borrow the money ah you don't i have got a watch here which belonged to my father and i want to pawn it for the money to pay the rent well it is rather out of our line of business to lend money on collateral i don't want you to lend it i want you to take it to the pawnbroker's mother says i am so young and so small that they might cheat me and i thought perhaps may be you'd be so kind as to go with me go with you exclaimed master simon as he eyed her coarse ill made garments i thought you would replied katy with a look of disappointment well katy i shall be very glad to assist you in this matter but master simon paused and glanced again at the unfashionable dress of the suppliant he was as he said willing to aid her but the idea of the principal personage of the house of sands co walking through the streets of the great city with such an ill dressed young lady was absurd and not to be tolerated master sneed reflected it is undoubtedly true that where there is a will there is a way where do you wish to go demanded he i don't know do you know where brattle street is i don't but i can find it very well important business in another street requires my personal attention for a moment but i will join you in brattle street in a quarter of an hour and attend you to a pawnbroker's thank you master sneed gave her directions so that she could find the street and at the end of the court as she turned one way he turned the other katy was first at the appointed place of meeting where simon soon joined her and directing her to follow him he led the way into another street and entered a shop this young person wishes to raise some money on a watch said simon as he directed the attention of the astonished broker to katy who was scarcely tall enough to be seen over the high counter let me see it katy handed up the watch which the money lender opened and carefully examined his practised eye soon discovered that the works of the watch were of the best quality where did you get this asked the broker my mother gave it to me and katy told without reserve the pitiful story of want and destitution which compelled mrs redburn to part with the cherished memento of the past i will give you three dollars for the watch added the broker come come sir interposed master simon with a smile that is a little too bad a gentleman of your judgment and discretion has already assured himself that the article is worth at least twenty the broker drew a long breath after this speech and seemed very much impressed by the style of the remark but katy declared she did not want to sell the watch only to pawn it your story is not a very plausible one said the broker and there is some risk in taking it i give you my personal assurance on honor that her story is all true added simon the broker burst out into a loud laugh he could not stand simon's fine speeches and would not take the watch at any rate so they departed to find another place and entered a shop close by where did you get this asked the broker sourly and katy repeated her story and simon vouched for its truth it is all a lie exclaimed the broker i will put the watch into my safe and hand it over to the police this is a most extraordinary proceeding protested master simon get out of the shop both of you or i will hand you over to the police you stole the watch and have the audacity to bring it into the shop of an honest man i don't buy stolen goods katy began to cry as the last hope of redemption from the fangs of dr flynch fled even master simon sneed was alarmed at the idea of being handed over to the police but his sense of dignity compelled him to enter his earnest protest against the proceeding of the broker and even to threaten him with the terrors of the law the money lender repeated his menace and even went to the door for the apparent purpose of putting it into execution come katy let us go but i assure you i will represent this outrage to my friend the mayor in such a manner that entire justice shall be done you whispered simon i cannot remain any longer away from my business or i would recover the watch at once o dear my poor mother sobbed katy don't cry my child leave it all to me and run home as fast as you can you shall have the watch again for i will call in the whole police force of boston to your aid and master simon ran away to attend to the affairs of sands co which katy innocently concluded must be suffering by this time from his absence poor katy with a heavy heart she wandered home to tell her mother of this new misfortune chapter iv katy matures a magnificent scheme i suppose it is all for the best mother said katy when she had told her sad story of disappointment i can't get those words out of my head since you have told me about my father i feel just as though everything would come out right it does go very bad just now i am glad you feel so katy added mrs redburn it will make you much better contented with your lot i have suffered so much that i cannot help repining a little though i feel that my destiny and yours is in the hands of the wise father who bringeth good out of evil katy had not yet reached that spirit of meek submission to the will of heaven which looks upward in the hour of trial not doubting that the all wise god knows best what is for the good of his children if she believed that misfortunes were all for the best it was only an impulse derived from the story of her father a kind of philosophy which was very convenient for the evil day because it permitted the sufferer to lie down and take things easily it was not a filial trust in the wisdom and mercy of the heavenly father that sustained her as the clouds grew thicker and blacker around her it was only a cold indifference a feeling of the head rather than the heart but mrs redburn had been reading the new testament during katy's absence and a better and purer spirit pervaded her soul than when the weight of the blow first struck so heavily upon her she was well educated and capable of reasoning in a just manner over her misfortunes and those words on the watch seemed to convey a new meaning to her as she considered them in the light of christian revelation they were not the basis of a cold philosophy they assured her of the paternal care of god the thought strengthened and revived her and when katy appeared to announce a new trial she received the intelligence with calmness and felt more ready than ever before to leave her destiny in the hands of heaven for an hour she conversed with katy on this subject and succeeded in giving her some new views in relation to the meaning of the words she had so often repeated that afternoon the poor girl felt as she had never felt before upon her devolved the responsibility of providing for her mother she had no other friend and that day seemed to open a new era in her existence she felt strong for the work before her and resolved to lose not a single day in putting her resolution into operation the teachings of her mother breathing a spirit of piety and resignation were grateful to her heart and added new strength to her arm there was still food enough in the house for katy's supper for her mother could not eat though she drank a cup of tea the morning sun would shine upon them again bringing another day of want and wretchedness but the poor girl banished her fears trusting for the morrow to him who feedeth the hungry raven and tempereth the wind to the shorn lamb she laid her head upon her pillow that night not to sleep for many a weary hour but to think of the future not of its sorrows and treasured ills but of the golden opportunities it would afford her to do something for her sick mother at one o'clock the next day dr flynch would come for the rent again and her mother could not pay him she felt assured he was cold and cruel enough to execute his wicked threat to turn them out of the house though her mother had not been off her bed for many weeks what could be done they could not pay the rent that was impossible and she regarded it as just as impossible to melt the heart of dr flynch but long before she went to sleep she had decided what to do worn out with fatigue and anxiety she did not wake till a late hour and her mother who had kept a weary vigil all night was glad to see her sleep so well and did not arouse her she was refreshed by her deep slumbers and got up feeling like a new creature she had scarcely made a fire and put on the tea kettle before a knock at the door startled her who could wish to see them in their poverty and want who but some evil person coming to heap some new grief upon them she scarcely had the courage to open the door but when she did so she saw the smiling face of tommy howard good morning katy said he as he handed her a little basket he had brought mother sent this over and wants to know how mrs redburn does to day she is about the same what is in this basket tommy o you know and he turned to run away stop a minute tommy called katy i want to speak to you well what is it you haven't told anybody about it have you about what what i told you yesterday replied katy hanging her head with shame what do you mean that we had nothing to eat and katy blushed as though it was a crime to be hungry and have nothing to eat not a soul catch me that is i hain't told nobody but mother i am sorry you did even her my mother is very proud if she is poor but she wasn't always so poor as she is now for she is the daughter of a rich merchant you don't say so yes i do tommy so please don't say a word about it to anybody but your mother and ask her not to mention it not a word katy mother won't say a word either and sometime i'll tell you all about it thank you for what's in the basket tommy without waiting for anything more the noble generous boy leaped down the stairs and passed out at the front door what have you got there katy asked mrs redburn as she entered the room with the basket in her hand something mrs howard sent us she replied as she opened the basket and took out a plate of butter and half a dozen hot biscuit which she carried to the bedside for her mother's inspection what have you done my child exclaimed the poor woman a flush gathering on her pale cheek have you told the neighbors that we have nothing to eat i couldn't help telling tommy when i asked for the flounders yesterday he told his mother but no one else knows it i had rather starve than beg katy but i cannot compel you to do so i will not beg then let us send those cakes back no mother we must not be so proud as that i think that god sent us this food through mrs howard and it would be wicked to reject his bounty do as you please katy some time we shall be able to pay her and that will make it all right mrs redburn could not taste the biscuit but katy ate heartily her pride was not inflated by the remembrance of brighter days all she had was inherited from her mother after breakfast she put on her bonnet and left the house assuring her mother she should be back by twelve o'clock she would not tell her where she was going but evaded her questions and got away as soon as she could as she passed down washington street she stopped before the store of sands co for she wanted to see master simon sneed she did not like to enter the store so she waited on the sidewalk for half an hour hoping he would come out as he did not appear her impatience would not permit her to lose any more time and she timidly opened the door and inquired of the first salesman she saw if mister sneed was in mister sneed laughed the clerk here simon is one of your friends wait upon her simon with a flushed cheek came to the door he was horrified at the insinuation of the salesman and wished katy had been on the other side of the ocean before she had come there to scandalize him by claiming his acquaintance what do you want now he demanded rather rudely is it not enough that i am willing to help you without your coming here to bring me into contempt with my associates i didn't think there was any harm in it i waited outside for half an hour and you didn't come out i can't leave the affairs of this firm to attend to every little and master simon's naturally good heart prevented him from uttering the unkind words that had been on his tongue i suppose you come to know about the watch i haven't had time to call upon the mayor yet but i will do so at dinner time i only wanted to ask you if you know where mrs gordon lives replied katy very sad at the thought of the mischief she had done she lives in temple street over back of the state house what do you want of her i want to see her do you suppose you can get that watch back i'm certain i can when my friend the mayor hears my story you may depend upon it he will get the watch or upset all the pawn brokers shops in the city are you acquainted with the mayor asked katy timidly for since the adventure of the previous day she had entertained some slight doubts in regard to the transcendent abilities of master simon sneed certainly i am it was only last week that i had a long and extremely interesting conversation with his honor on the sidewalk here before the store katy was satisfied though simon did not offer to introduce her to his distinguished friend how could she help being satisfied in the face of such astounding evidence and simon's declaration was true for whatever faults he had he never made up a story out of whole cloth it was undeniably true that he had conversed with the mayor for ten full minutes at the time and place represented simon had been sent out to hold his honor's horse while a lady with him did some shopping but his honor preferred to hold his own horse and amused himself for the time in listening to the big talk of the nice young man after receiving more explicit directions in regard to the residence of mrs gordon katy took her leave of simon next door to sands co s was the store of a celebrated confectioner in the window with sundry sugar temples cob houses of braided candy and stacks of cake was a great heap of molasses candy and as katy paused for an instant to gaze at the profusion of sweet things a great thought struck through her brain mother used to make molasses candy for me and i know just how it is done said she to herself what is the reason i can't make candy and sell it she walked on towards school street up which she had been directed to turn full of this idea she would become a little candy merchant she felt sure she could find purchasers enough if her merchandise only looked clean and good it was a great deal better than begging and she thought her mother would consent to her making and selling the candy what a glorious idea if she could only make money enough to support her mother and herself how happy she should be full of enthusiasm at the idea of accomplishing such a vast project she scarcely heeded the crowds of people that thronged the street and rudely jostled her if she saw them at all it was only to regard them as so many purchasers of molasses candy with her brain almost reeling with the immensity and magnificence of her scheme she reached temple street after a little search she found the number of mrs gordon's residence on a splendid house whose grandness quite abashed her but her courage revived as she thought of the purpose that had brought her there and she boldly rang the bell the door was opened by a servant man in a white jacket of whom she inquired if mrs gordon was at home mrs gordon is at home but we don't trouble her at the call of a beggar replied the well fed servant as he glanced at the homely apparel of katy i am not a beggar she replied with spirit her cheek reddening with indignation at the charge you can't see her so go about your business who is it michael said a gentle voice within only a beggar miss grace she wants to see mrs gordon replied the man and then a beautiful young lady came to look at her i am not a beggar ma'am indeed i am not i want to see mrs gordon very much please to let me speak to her the sweet pleading tones of the child produced their impression on the beautiful lady and she bade her come in katy entered and michael told her to stand in the entry while miss grace went up stairs to call mrs gordon chapter v katy visits mrs gordon and gets rid of dr flynch katy gazed with wonder and admiration at the rich furniture of the house and thought that perhaps her grandfather lived in as good style as mrs gordon and that she might some day go to liverpool and be an inmate of just such a palace the door of the sitting room was open and she had an opportunity to look at all the fine things it contained she had never seen anything so luxurious before and i must say that she regretted the poverty of her lot which deprived her mother and herself of them all round the room hung pictures in costly frames some of them were portraits and one which hung over the mantelpiece directly before her soon attracted her attention and made her forget the soft divans the beautiful carpet and the rich draperies of the windows it was the portrait of a lady and her expression was very like that of her mother so like that she could almost believe the picture had been painted for her mother yet that could not be for the lady was young and plump and rosy and wore rich laces and a costly dress she seemed to look down upon her from the golden frame with a smile of satisfaction there was something roguish in her eye as though she was on the point of bursting into a laugh at some mischief she had perpetrated o no that could not be her mother she had never seen her look like that but there was something that seemed very much like her and the more she looked at it the more the picture fascinated her she tried to look at something else but the lady appeared to have fixed her gaze upon her and whichever way she turned those laughing eyes followed her and brought back her attention to the canvas again in vain she attempted to fasten her mind upon some of the other portraits there was an elderly gentleman with a full red face but the jealous lady would not let her look at him she turned round and looked out the windows at the side of the door but the spell of the lady was upon her and she could not resist the charm the more she studied the portrait the more convinced she became that it looked like her mother though there was something about it which was as unlike her as anything could be what makes you keep looking at me said katy to herself or rather to the lady on the canvas you needn't watch me so closely i shall not steal anything the lady however insisted on watching her and kept her roguish glance fixed upon her with a steadiness that began to make her feel nervous and uneasy and she was greatly relieved when she heard footsteps on the stairs mrs gordon will be down in a moment said miss grace in kind tones won't you come into this room and sit down"
