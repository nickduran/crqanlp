brought his coffin back in great state and buried it in the mausoleum with his parents so prince dolor was seen no more the country went into deep mourning for him and then forgot him and his uncle reigned in his stead that illustrious personage accepted his crown with great decorum and wore it with great dignity to the last but whether he enjoyed it or not there is no evidence to show chapter iii and what of the little lame prince whom everybody seemed so easily to have forgotten not everybody there were a few kind souls mothers of families who had heard his sad story and some servants about the palace who had been familiar with his sweet ways these many a time sighed and said poor prince dolor or looking at the beautiful mountains which were visible all over nomansland though few people ever visited them well perhaps his royal highness is better where he is than even there they did not know indeed hardly anybody did know that beyond the mountains between them and the sea lay a tract of country barren level bare except for short stunted grass and here and there a patch of tiny flowers not a bush not a tree not a resting place for bird or beast was in that dreary plain in summer the sunshine fell upon it hour after hour with a blinding glare in winter the winds and rains swept over it unhindered and the snow came down steadily noiselessly covering it from end to end in one great white sheet which lay for days and weeks unmarked by a single footprint not a pleasant place to live in and nobody did live there apparently the only sign that human creatures had ever been near the spot was one large round tower which rose up in the center of the plain and might be seen all over it if there had been anybody to see which there never was rose right up out of the ground as if it had grown of itself like a mushroom but it was not at all mushroom like on the contrary it was very solidly built in form it resembled the irish round towers which have puzzled people for so long nobody being able to find out when or by whom or for what purpose they were made seemingly for no use at all like this tower it was circular of very firm brickwork with neither doors nor windows until near the top when you could perceive some slits in the wall through which one might possibly creep in or look out its height was nearly a hundred feet and it had a battlemented parapet showing sharp against the sky as the plain was quite desolate almost like a desert only without sand and led to nowhere except the still more desolate seacoast nobody ever crossed it whatever mystery there was about the tower it and the sky and the plain kept their secret to themselves it was a very great secret indeed a state secret which none but so clever a man as the present king of nomansland would ever have thought of how he carried it out undiscovered i cannot tell people said long afterward that it was by means of a gang of condemned criminals who were set to work and executed immediately after they had done so that nobody knew anything or in the least suspected the real fact and what was the fact why that this tower which seemed a mere mass of masonry utterly forsaken and uninhabited was not so at all within twenty feet of the top some ingenious architect had planned a perfect little house divided into four rooms as by drawing a cross within a circle you will see might easily be done by making skylights and a few slits in the walls for windows and raising a peaked roof which was hidden by the parapet here was a dwelling complete eighty feet from the ground and as inaccessible as a rook's nest on the top of a tree a charming place to live in if you once got up there and never wanted to come down again inside though nobody could have looked inside except a bird and hardly even a bird flew past that lonely tower inside it was furnished with all the comfort and elegance imaginable with lots of books and toys and everything that the heart of a child could desire for its only inhabitant except a nurse of course was a poor solitary child one winter night when all the plain was white with moonlight there was seen crossing it a great tall black horse ridden by a man also big and equally black carrying before him on the saddle a woman and a child the woman she had a sad fierce look and no wonder for she was a criminal under sentence of death but her sentence had been changed to almost as severe a punishment she was to inhabit the lonely tower with the child and was allowed to live as long as the child lived no longer this in order that she might take the utmost care of him for those who put him there were equally afraid of his dying and of his living yet he was only a little gentle boy with a sweet sleepy smile he had been very tired with his long journey and clinging arms which held tight to the man's neck for he was rather frightened and the face black as it was looked kindly at him and he was very helpless with his poor small shriveled legs which could neither stand nor run away for the little forlorn boy was prince dolor he had not been dead at all or buried either his grand funeral had been a mere pretense a wax figure having been put in his place while he himself was spirited away under charge of these two the condemned woman and the black man the latter was deaf and dumb so could neither tell nor repeat anything when they reached the foot of the tower there was light enough to see a huge chain dangling from the parapet but dangling only halfway the deaf mute took from his saddle wallet a sort of ladder arranged in pieces like a puzzle fitted it together and lifted it up to meet the chain then he mounted to the top of the tower and slung from it a sort of chair in which the woman and the child placed themselves and were drawn up never to come down again as long as they lived leaving them there the man descended the ladder took it to pieces again and packed it in his pack mounted the horse and disappeared across the plain every month they used to watch for him appearing like a speck in the distance he fastened his horse to the foot of the tower and climbed it as before laden with provisions and many other things he always saw the prince so as to make sure that the child was alive and well and then went away until the following month while his first childhood lasted prince dolor was happy enough he had every luxury that even a prince could need and the one thing wanting love never having known he did not miss his nurse was very kind to him though she was a wicked woman but either she had not been quite so wicked as people said or she grew better through being shut up continually with a little innocent child who was dependent upon her for every comfort and pleasure of his life it was not an unhappy life there was nobody to tease or ill use him and he was never ill he played about from room to room there were four rooms parlor kitchen his nurse's bedroom and his own learned to crawl like a fly and to jump like a frog and to run about on all fours almost as fast as a puppy in fact he was very much like a puppy or a kitten as thoughtless and as merry scarcely ever cross though sometimes a little weary as he grew older he occasionally liked to be quiet for a while and then he would sit at the slits of windows which were however much bigger than they looked from the bottom of the tower and watch the sky above and the ground below with the storms sweeping over and the sunshine coming and going and the shadows of the clouds running races across the blank plain by and by he began to learn lessons not that his nurse had been ordered to teach him but she did it partly to amuse herself she was not a stupid woman and prince dolor was by no means a stupid boy so they got on very well and his continual entreaty what can i do what can you find me to do was stopped at least for an hour or two in the day it was a dull life but he had never known any other anyhow he remembered no other and he did not pity himself at all not for a long time till he grew quite a big little boy and could read quite easily then he suddenly took to books which the deaf mute brought him from time to time books which not being acquainted with the literature of nomansland i cannot describe but no doubt they were very interesting and they informed him of everything in the outside world and filled him with an intense longing to see it from this time a change came over the boy he began to look sad and thin and to shut himself up for hours without speaking for his nurse hardly spoke and whatever questions he asked beyond their ordinary daily life she never answered she had indeed been forbidden on pain of death to tell him anything about himself who he was or what he might have been he knew he was prince dolor because she always addressed him as my prince and your royal highness but what a prince was he had not the least idea he had no idea of anything in the world except what he found in his books he sat one day surrounded by them having built them up round him like a little castle wall he had been reading them half the day but feeling all the while that to read about things which you never can see is like hearing about a beautiful dinner while you are starving for almost the first time in his life he grew melancholy his hands fell on his lap he sat gazing out of the window slit upon the view outside the view he had looked at every day of his life and might look at for endless days more not a very cheerful view just the plain and the sky but he liked it he used to think if he could only fly out of that window up to the sky or down to the plain how nice it would be perhaps when he died his nurse had told him once in anger that he would never leave the tower till he died he might be able to do this not that he understood much what dying meant but it must be a change and any change seemed to him a blessing and i wish i had somebody to tell me all about it about that and many other things somebody that would be fond of me like my poor white kitten here the tears came into his eyes for the boy's one friend the one interest of his life had been a little white kitten which the deaf mute kindly smiling once took out of his pocket and gave him the only living creature prince dolor had ever seen for four weeks it was his constant plaything and companion till one moonlight night it took a fancy for wandering climbed on to the parapet of the tower dropped over and disappeared it was not killed he hoped for cats have nine lives indeed he almost fancied he saw it pick itself up and scamper away but he never caught sight of it more yes i wish i had something better than a kitten a person a real live person who would be fond of me and kind to me oh i want somebody dreadfully dreadfully as he spoke there sounded behind him a slight tap tap tap as of a stick or a cane and twisting himself round he saw what do you think he saw nothing either frightening or ugly but still exceedingly curious a little woman no bigger than he might himself have been had his legs grown like those of other children but she was not a child she was an old woman her hair was gray and her dress was gray and there was a gray shadow over her wherever she moved but she had the sweetest smile the prettiest hands and when she spoke it was in the softest voice imaginable my dear little boy and dropping her cane the only bright and rich thing about her she laid those two tiny hands on his shoulders my own little boy i could not come to you until you had said you wanted me but now you do want me here i am and you are very welcome madam replied the prince trying to speak politely as princes always did in books and i am exceedingly obliged to you may i ask who you are perhaps my mother for he knew that little boys usually had a mother and had occasionally wondered what had become of his own no said the visitor with a tender half sad smile putting back the hair from his forehead and looking right into his eyes no i am not your mother though she was a dear friend of mine and you are as like her as ever you can be will you tell her to come and see me then she cannot but i dare say she knows all about you and she loves you very much and so do i and i want to help you all i can my poor little boy why do you call me poor asked prince dolor in surprise the little old woman glanced down on his legs and feet which he did not know were different from those of other children and then at his sweet bright face which though he knew not that either was exceedingly different from many children's faces which are often so fretful cross sullen looking at him instead of sighing she smiled i beg your pardon my prince said she yes i am a prince and my name is dolor will you tell me yours madam the little old woman laughed like a chime of silver bells i have not got a name or rather i have so many names that i don't know which to choose however it was i who gave you yours and you will belong to me all your days i am your godmother hurrah cried the little prince i am glad i belong to you for i like you very much will you come and play with me so they sat down together and played by and by they began to talk are you very dull here asked the little old woman not particularly thank you godmother i have plenty to eat and drink and my lessons to do and my books to read lots of books and you want nothing nothing yes perhaps if you please godmother could you bring me just one more thing what sort of thing a little boy to play with the old woman looked very sad just the thing alas i which i cannot give you my child i cannot alter your lot in any way but i can help you to bear it thank you but why do you talk of bearing it i have nothing to bear my poor little man said the old woman in the very tenderest tone of her tender voice kiss me what is kissing asked the wondering child his godmother took him in her arms and embraced him many times by and by he kissed her back again at first awkwardly and shyly then with all the strength of his warm little heart you are better to cuddle than even my white kitten i think promise me that you will never go away i must but i will leave a present behind me something as good as myself to amuse you something that will take you wherever you want to go and show you all that you wish to see what is it a traveling cloak the prince's countenance fell i don't want a cloak for i never go out sometimes nurse hoists me on to the roof and carries me round by the parapet but that is all i can't walk you know as she does the more reason why you should ride and besides this traveling cloak hush she's coming there sounded outside the room door a heavy step and a grumpy voice and a rattle of plates and dishes it's my nurse and she is bringing my dinner but i don't want dinner at all i only want you will her coming drive you away godmother perhaps but only for a little while never mind all the bolts and bars in the world couldn't keep me out i'd fly in at the window or down through the chimney only wish for me and i come thank you said prince dolor but almost in a whisper for he was very uneasy at what might happen next his nurse and his godmother what would they say to one another how would they look at one another two such different faces one harsh lined sullen cross and sad the other sweet and bright and calm as a summer evening before the dark begins when the door was flung open prince dolor shut his eyes trembling all over opening them again he saw he need fear nothing his lovely old godmother had melted away just like the rainbow out of the sky as he had watched it many a time nobody but his nurse was in the room what a muddle your royal highness is sitting in said she sharply such a heap of untidy books and what's this rubbish knocking a little bundle that lay beside them oh nothing nothing give it me cried the prince and darting after it he hid it under his pinafore and then pushed it quickly into his pocket rubbish as it was it was left in the place where she sat and might be something belonging to her his dear kind godmother whom already he loved with all his lonely tender passionate heart it was though he did not know this his wonderful traveling cloak chapter iv and what of the traveling cloak what sort of cloak was it and what a good did it do the prince stay and i'll tell you all about it outside it was the commonest looking bundle imaginable shabby and small and the instant prince dolor touched it it grew smaller still dwindling down till he could put it in his trousers pocket like a handkerchief rolled up into a ball he did this at once for fear his nurse should see it and kept it there all day all night too till after his next morning's lessons he had no opportunity of examining his treasure when he did it seemed no treasure at all but a mere piece of cloth circular in form dark green in color that is if it had any color at all being so worn and shabby though not dirty it had a split cut to the center forming a round hole for the neck and that was all its shape the shape in fact of those cloaks which in south america are called ponchos very simple but most graceful and convenient prince dolor had never seen anything like it in spite of his disappointment he examined it curiously spread it out on the door then arranged it on his shoulders it felt very warm and comfortable but it was so exceedingly shabby the only shabby thing that the prince had ever seen in his life and what use will it be to me said he sadly i have no need of outdoor clothes as i never go out why was this given me i wonder and what in the world am i to do with it she must be a rather funny person this dear godmother of mine nevertheless because she was his godmother and had given him the cloak he folded it carefully and put it away poor and shabby as it was hiding it in a safe corner of his top cupboard which his nurse never meddled with he did not want her to find it or to laugh at it or at his godmother as he felt sure she would if she knew all there it lay and by and by he forgot all about it nay i am sorry to say that being but a child and not seeing her again he almost forgot his sweet old godmother or thought of her only as he did of the angels or fairies that he read of in his books and of her visit as if it had been a mere dream of the night there were times certainly when he recalled her of early mornings like that morning when she appeared beside him and late evenings when the gray twilight reminded him of the color of her hair and her pretty soft garments above all when waking in the middle of the night with the stars peering in at his window or the moonlight shining across his little bed he would not have been surprised to see her standing beside it looking at him with those beautiful tender eyes which seemed to have a pleasantness and comfort in them different from anything he had ever known but she never came and gradually she slipped out of his memory only a boy's memory after all until something happened which made him remember her and want her as he had never wanted anything before prince dolor fell ill he caught his nurse could not tell how a complaint common to the people of nomansland called the doldrums as unpleasant as measles or any other of our complaints and it made him restless cross and disagreeable even when a little better he was too weak to enjoy anything but lay all day long on his sofa fidgeting his nurse extremely while in her intense terror lest he might die she fidgeted him still more at last seeing he really was getting well she left him to himself which he was most glad of in spite of his dullness and dreariness there he lay alone quite alone now and then an irritable fit came over him in which he longed to get up and do something or to go somewhere would have liked to imitate his white kitten jump down from the tower and run away taking the chance of whatever might happen only one thing alas was likely to happen for the kitten he remembered had four active legs while he i wonder what my godmother meant when she looked at my legs and sighed so bitterly i wonder why i can't walk straight and steady like my nurse only i wouldn't like to have her great noisy clumping shoes still it would be very nice to move about quickly perhaps to fly like a bird like that string of birds i saw the other day skimming across the sky one after the other these were the passage birds the only living creatures that ever crossed the lonely plain and he had been much interested in them wonder ing whence they came and whither they were going how nice it must be to be a bird if legs are no good why cannot one have wings people have wings when they die perhaps i wish i were dead that i do i am so tired so tired and nobody cares for me nobody ever did care for me except perhaps my godmother godmother dear have you quite forsaken me he stretched himself wearily gathered himself up and dropped his head upon his hands as he did so he felt somebody kiss him at the back of his neck and turning found that he was resting not on the sofa pillows but on a warm shoulder that of the little old woman clothed in gray how glad he was to see her how he looked into her kind eyes and felt her hands to see if she were all real and alive then put both his arms round her neck and kissed her as if he would never have done kissing stop stop cried she pretending to be smothered i see you have not forgotten my teachings kissing is a good thing in moderation only just let me have breath to speak one word a dozen he said well then tell me all that has happened to you since i saw you or rather since you saw me which is quite a different thing nothing has happened nothing ever does happen to me answered the prince dolefully and are you very dull my boy so dull that i was just thinking whether i could not jump down to the bottom of the tower like my white kitten don't do that not being a white kitten i wish i were i wish i were anything but what i am and you can't make yourself any different nor can i do it either you must be content to stay just what you are the little old woman said this very firmly but gently too with her arms round his neck and her lips on his forehead it was the first time the boy had ever heard any one talk like this and he looked up in surprise but not in pain for her sweet manner softened the hardness of her words now my prince for you are a prince and must behave as such let us see what we can do how much i can do for you or show you how to do for yourself where is your traveling cloak prince dolor blushed extremely i i put it away in the cupboard i suppose it is there still you have never used it you dislike it he hesitated no wishing to be impolite don't you think it's just a little old and shabby for a prince the old woman laughed long and loud though very sweetly prince indeed why if all the princes in the world craved for it they couldn't get it unless i gave it them old and shabby it's the most valuable thing imaginable very few ever have it but i thought i would give it to you because because you are different from other people am i said the prince and looked first with curiosity then with a sort of anxiety into his godmother's face which was sad and grave with slow tears beginning to steal down she touched his poor little legs these are not like those of other little boys indeed my nurse never told me that very likely not but it is time you were told and i tell you because i love you tell me what dear godmother that you will never be able to walk or run or jump or play that your life will be quite different from most people's lives but it may be a very happy life for all that do not be afraid i am not afraid said the boy but he turned very pale and his lips began to quiver though he did not actually cry he was too old for that and perhaps too proud though not wholly comprehending he began dimly to guess what his godmother meant he had never seen any real live boys but he had seen pictures of them running and jumping which he had admired and tried hard to imitate but always failed now he began to understand why he failed and that he always should fail that in fact he was not like other little boys and it was of no use his wishing to do as they did and play as they played even if he had had them to play with his was a separate life in which he must find out new work and new pleasures for himself the sense of the inevitable as grown up people call it that we cannot have things as we want them to be but as they are and that we must learn to bear them and make the best of them this lesson which everybody has to learn soon or late came alas sadly soon to the poor boy he fought against it for a while and then quite overcome turned and sobbed bitterly in his godmother's arms she comforted him i do not know how except that love always comforts and then she whispered to him in her sweet strong cheerful voice never mind no i don't think i do mind that is i won't mind replied he catching the courage of her tone and speaking like a"
