"1" "money from his pocket in the majority of cases it is impossible to fight against fate said he as if trying to justify himself before someone but if the teacher controlled himself for a whole week then there was a touching farewell scene between the two friends which ended as a rule in the eating house of vaviloff the teacher did not spend all his money but spent at least half on the children of the main street the poor are always rich in children and in the dirt and ditches of this street there were groups of them from morning to night hungry naked and dirty children are the living flowers of the earth but these had the appearance of flowers that have faded prematurely because they grew in ground where there was no healthy nourishment often the teacher would gather them round him would buy them bread eggs apples and nuts and take them into the fields by the river side there they would sit and greedily eat everything he offered them after which they would begin to play filling the fields for a mile around with careless noise and laughter the tall thin figure of the drunkard towered above these small people who treated him familiarly as if he were one of their own age they called him philip and did not trouble to prefix uncle to his name playing around him like little wild animals they pushed him jumped upon his back beat him upon his bald head and caught hold of his nose all this must have pleased him as he did not protest against such liberties he spoke very little to them and when he did so he did it cautiously as if afraid that his words would hurt or contaminate them he passed many hours thus as their companion and plaything watching their lively faces with his gloomy eyes then he would thoughtfully and slowly direct his steps to the eatinghouse of vaviloff where he would drink silently and quickly till all his senses left him almost every day after his reporting he would bring a newspaper and then gather round him all these creatures that once were men on seeing him they would come forward from all corners of the court yard drunk or suffering from drunken headache dishevelled tattered miserable and pitiable then would come the barrel like stout aleksei maksimovitch simtsoff formerly inspector of woods and forests under the department of appendages but now trading in matches ink blacking and lemons he was an old man of sixty in a canvas overcoat and a wide brimmed hat the greasy borders of which hid his stout fat red face he had a thick white beard out of which a small red nose turned gaily heavenwards he had thick crimson lips and watery cynical eyes they called him kubar a name which well described his round figure and buzzing speech after him kanets appeared from some corner a dark sad looking silent drunkard then the former governor of the prison luka antonovitch martyanoff a man who existed on remeshok trilistika and bankovka and many such cunning games not much appreciated by the police he would throw his hard and oft scourged body on the grass beside the teacher and turning his eyes round and scratching his head would ask in a hoarse bass voice may i note by translator well known games of chance played by the lower classes the police specially endeavour to stop them but unsuccessfully then appeared pavel solntseff a man of thirty years of age suffering from consumption the ribs of his left side had been broken in a quarrel and the sharp yellow face like that of a fox always wore a malicious smile the thin lips when opened exposed two rows of decayed black teeth and the rags on his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards as if they were hung on a clothes pole they called him abyedok he hawked brushes and bath brooms of his own manufacture good strong brushes made from a peculiar kind of grass then followed a lean and bony man of whom no one knew anything with a frightened expression in his eyes the left one of which had a squint he was silent and timid and had been imprisoned three times for theft by the high court of justice and the magisterial courts his family name was kiselnikoff but they called him paltara taras because he was a head and shoulders taller than his friend deacon taras who had been degraded from his office for drunkenness and immorality the deacon was a short thick set person with the chest of an athlete and a round strong head he danced skilfully and was still more skilful at swearing he and paltara taras worked in the wood on the banks of the river and in free hours he told his friend or any one who would listen tales of my own composition as he used to say on hearing these stories the heroes of which always seemed to be saints kings priests or generals even the inmates of the dosshouse spat and rubbed their eyes in astonishment at the imagination of the deacon who told them shameless tales of lewd fantastic adventures with blinking eyes and a passionless expression of countenance the imagination of this man was powerful and inexhaustible he could go on relating and composing all day from morning to night without once repeating what he had said before in his expression you sometimes saw the poet gone astray sometimes the romancer and he always succeeded in making his tales realistic by the effective and powerful words in which he told them there was also a foolish young man called kuvalda meteor one night he came to sleep in the dosshouse and had remained ever since among these men much to their astonishment at first they did not take much notice of him in the daytime like all the others he went away to find something to eat but at nights he always loitered around this friendly company till at last the captain took notice of him boy what business have you here on this earth the boy answered boldly and stoutly i am a barefooted tramp the captain looked critically at him this youngster had long hair and a weak face with prominent cheek bones and a turned up nose he was dressed in a blue blouse without a waistband and on his head he wore the remains of a straw hat while his feet were bare you are a fool decided aristid kuvalda what are you knocking about here for you are of absolutely no use to us do you drink vodki no well then can you steal again no go away learn and come back again when you know something and are a man the youngster smiled no i shall live with you why just because oh you meteor said the captain i will break his teeth for him said martyanoff and why asked the youngster just because and i will take a stone and hit you on the head the young man answered respectfully martyanoff would have broken his bones had not kuvalda interrupted with leave him alone is this a home to you or even to us you have no sufficient reason to break his teeth for him you have no better reason than he for living with us well then devil take him we all live in the world without sufficient reason we live and why because he also because let him alone but it is better for you young man to go away from us the teacher advised him looking him up and down with his sad eyes he made no answer but remained and they soon became accustomed to his presence and ceased to take any notice of him but he lived among them and observed everything the above were the chief members of the captain's company and he called them with kind hearted sarcasm creatures that once were men for though there were men who had experienced as much of the bitter irony of fate as these men yet they were not fallen so low not infrequently respectable men belonging to the cultured classes are inferior to those belonging to the peasantry and it is always a fact that the depraved man from the city is immeasurably worse than the depraved man from the village this fact was strikingly illustrated by the contrast between the formerly well educated men and the mujiks who were living in kuvalda's shelter the representative of the latter class was an old mujik called tyapa tall and angular he kept his head in such a position that his chin touched his breast he was the captain's first lodger and it was said of him that he had a great deal of money hidden somewhere and for its sake had nearly had his throat cut some two years ago ever since then he carried his head thus over his eyes hung greyish eyebrows and looked at in profile only his crooked nose was to be seen his shadow reminded one of a poker he denied that he had money and said that they only tried to cut his throat out of malice and from that day he took to collecting rags and that is why his head was always bent as if incessantly looking on the ground when he went about shaking his head and minus a walking stick in his hand and a bag on his back the signs of his profession he seemed to be thinking almost to madness and at such times kuvalda spoke thus pointing to him with his finger look there is the conscience of merchant judas petunikoff see how disorderly dirty and low is the escaped conscience tyapa as a rule spoke in a hoarse and hardly audible voice and that is why he spoke very little and loved to be alone but whenever a stranger compelled to leave the village appeared in the dosshouse tyapa seemed sadder and angrier and followed the unfortunate about with biting jeers and a wicked chuckling in his throat he either put some beggar against him or himself threatened to rob and beat him till the frightened mujik would disappear from the dosshouse and never more be seen then tyapa was quiet again and would sit in some corner mending his rags or else reading his bible which was as dirty worn and old as himself only when the teacher brought a newspaper and began reading did he come from his corner once more as a rule tyapa listened to what was read silently and sighed often without asking anything of anyone but once when the teacher having read the paper wanted to put it away tyapa stretched out his bony hand and said give it to me what do you want it for give it to me perhaps there is something in it about us about whom about the village they laughed at him and threw him the paper he took it and read in it how in the village the hail had destroyed the cornfields how in another village fire destroyed thirty houses and that in a third a woman had poisoned her family in fact everything that it is customary to write of everything that is to say which is bad and which depicts only the worst side of the unfortunate village tyapa read all this silently and roared perhaps from sympathy perhaps from delight at the sad news he passed the whole sunday in reading his bible and never went out collecting rags on that day while reading he groaned and sighed continually he kept the book close to his breast and was angry with any one who interrupted him or who touched his bible oh you drunken blackguard said kuvalda to him what do you understand of it nothing wizard i don't understand anything and i do not read any books but i read therefore you are a fool said the captain decidedly when there are insects in your head you know it is uncomfortable but if some thoughts enter there too how will you live then you old toad i have not long to live said tyapa quietly once the teacher asked how he had learned to read in prison answered tyapa shortly have you been there i was there for what just so it was a mistake but i brought the bible out with me from there a lady gave it to me it is good in prison brother is that so and why it teaches one i learned to read there i also got this book and all these you see free when the teacher appeared in the dosshouse tyapa had already lived there for some time he looked long into the teacher's face as if to discover what kind of a man he was tyapa often listened to his conversation and once sitting down beside him said i see you are very learned have you read the bible i have read it i see i see can you remember it yes i remember it then the old man leaned to one side and gazed at the other with a serious suspicious glance there were the amalekites do you remember well where are they now disappeared tyapa died out the old man was silent then asked again and where are the philistines these also have all these died out yes all and so we also will die out there will come a time when we also will die said the teacher indifferently and to what tribe of israel do we belong the teacher looked at him and began telling him about scythians and slavs the old man became all the more frightened and glanced at his face you are lying he said scornfully when the teacher had finished what lie have i told asked the teacher you mentioned tribes that are not mentioned in the bible he got up and walked away angry and deeply insulted you will go mad tyapa called the teacher after him with conviction then the old man came back again and stretching out his hand threatened him with his crooked and dirty finger god made adam from adam were descended the jews that means that all people are descended from jews and we also well tartars are descended from ishmael but he also came of the jews what do you want to tell me all this for nothing only why do you tell lies then he walked away leaving his companion in perplexity but after two days he came again and sat by him you are learned tell me then whose descendants are we are we babylonians or who are we we are slavs tyapa said the teacher and attentively awaited his answer wishing to understand him speak to me from the bible there are no such men there then the teacher began criticising the bible the old man listened and interrupted him after a long while stop wait that means that among people known to god there are no russians we are not known to god is it so god knew all those who are mentioned in the bible he destroyed them by sword and fire he destroyed their cities but he also sent prophets to teach them that means that he also pitied them he scattered the jews and the tartars but what about us why have we prophets no longer well i don't know replied the teacher trying to understand the old man but the latter put his hand on the teacher's shoulder and slowly pushed him backwards and forwards and his throat made a noise as if he were swallowing something tell me you speak so much as if you knew everything it makes me sick to listen to you you darken my soul i should be better pleased if you were silent who are we eh why have we no prophets ha ha where were we when christ walked on this earth do you see and you too you are lying do you think that all die out the russian people will never disappear you are lying it has been written in the bible only it is not known what name the russians are given do you see what kind of people they are they are numberless how many villages are there on the earth think of all the people who live on it so strong so numerous and you say that they will die out men shall die but god wants the people god the creator of the earth the amalekites did not die out they are either german or french but you eh you now then tell me why we are abandoned by god have we no punishments nor prophets from the lord who then will teach us tyapa spoke strongly and plainly and there was faith in his words he had been speaking a long time and the teacher who was generally drunk and in a speechless condition could not stand it any longer he looked at the dry wrinkled old man felt the great force of these words and suddenly began to pity himself he wished to say something so strong and convincing to the old man that tyapa would be disposed in his favour he did not wish to speak in such a serious earnest way but in a soft and fatherly tone and the teacher felt as if something were rising from his breast into his throat but he could not find any powerful words what kind of a man are you your soul seems to be torn away and you still continue speaking as if you knew something it would be better if you were silent ah tyapa what you say is true replied the teacher sadly the people you are right they are numberless but i am a stranger to them and they are strangers to me do you see where the tragedy of my life is hidden but let me alone i shall suffer and there are no prophets also no you are right i speak a great deal but it is no good to anyone i shall be always silent only don't speak with me like this ah old man you do not know you do not know and you cannot understand and in the end the teacher cried he cried so easily and so freely with such torrents of flowing tears that he soon found relief you ought to go into a village become a clerk or a teacher you would be well fed there what are you crying for asked tyapa sadly but the teacher was crying as if the tears quieted and comforted him from this day they became friends and the creatures that once were men seeing them together said the teacher is friendly with tyapa he wishes his money kuvalda must have put this into his head to look about to see where the old man's fortune is probably they did not believe what they said there was one strange thing about these men namely that they painted themselves to others worse than they actually were a man who has good in him does not mind sometimes showing his worse nature when all these people were gathered round the teacher then the reading of the newspaper would begin well what does the newspaper discuss to day is there any feuilleton no the teacher informs him your publisher seems greedy but is there any leader there is one to day it appears to be by gulyaeff aha come out with it he writes cleverly the rascal the taxation of immovable property reads the teacher was introduced some fifteen years ago and up to the present it has served as the basis for collecting these taxes in aid of the city revenue that is simple comments captain kuvalda it continues to serve that is ridiculous to the merchant who is moving about in the city it is profitable that it should continue to serve therefore it does continue the article in fact is written on the subject says the teacher is it that is strange it is more a subject for a feuilleton such a subject must be treated with plenty of pepper then a short discussion begins the people listen attentively as only one bottle of vodki has been drunk after the leader they read the local events then the court proceedings and if in the police court it reports that the defendant or plaintiff is a merchant then aristid kuvalda sincerely rejoices if someone has robbed the merchant that is good says he only it is a pity they robbed him of so little if his horses have broken down it is sad that he is still alive if the merchant has lost his suit in court it is a pity that the costs were not double the amount that would have been illegal remarks the teacher illegal but is the merchant himself legal inquires kuvalda bitterly what is the merchant let us investigate this rough and uncouth phenomenon first of all every merchant is a mujik he comes from a village and in course of time becomes a merchant in order to be a merchant one must have money where can the mujik get the money from it is well known that he does not get it by honest hard work and that means that the mujik somehow or other has been swindling that is to say a merchant is simply a dishonest mujik splendid cry the people approving the orator's deduction and tyapa bellows all the time scratching his breast he always bellows like this as he drinks his first glass of vodki when he has a drunken headache the captain beams with joy they next read the correspondence this is for the captain an abundance of drinks as he himself calls it he always notices how the merchants make this life abominable and how cleverly they spoil everything his speeches thunder at and annihilate merchants his audience listens to him with the greatest pleasure because he swears atrociously if i wrote for the papers he shouts i would show up the merchant in his true colours i would show that he is a beast playing for a time the role of a man i understand him he is a rough boor does not know the meaning of the words good taste has no notion of patriotism and his knowledge is not worth five kopecks abyedok knowing the captain's weak point and fond of making other people angry cunningly adds yes since the nobility began to make acquaintance with hunger men have disappeared from the world you are right you son of a spider and a toad yes from the time that the noblemen fell there have been no men there are only merchants and i hate them that is easy to understand brother because you too have been brought down by them i i was ruined by love of life fool that i was i loved life but the merchant spoils it and i cannot bear it simply for this reason and not because i am a nobleman but if you want to know the truth i was once a man though i was not noble i care now for nothing and nobody and all my life has been tame a sweetheart who has jilted me therefore i despise life and am indifferent to it you lie says abyedok i lie roars aristid kuvalda almost crimson with anger why shout comes in the cold sad voice of martyanoff why judge others merchants noblemen what have we to do with them seeing that we are puts in deacon taras be quiet abyedok says the teacher goodnaturedly why do you provoke him he does not love either discussion or noise and when they quarrel all around him his lips form into a sickly grimace and he endeavours quietly and reasonably to reconcile each with the other and if he does not succeed in this he leaves the company knowing this the captain if he is not very drunk controls himself not wishing to lose in the person of the teacher one of the best of his listeners i repeat he continues in a quieter tone that i see life in the hands of enemies not only enemies of the noble but of everything good avaricious and incapable of adorning existence in any way but all the same says the teacher merchants so to speak created genoa venice holland and all these were merchants merchants from england india the stroyanoff merchants i do not speak of these men i am thinking of judas petunikoff who is one of them and you say you have nothing to do with them asks the teacher quietly but do you think that i do not live aha i do live but i suppose i ought not to be angry at the fact that life is desecrated and robbed of all freedom by these men and they dare to laugh at the kindly anger of the captain a man living in retirement says abyedok teasingly very well i agree with you that i am foolish being a creature who was once a man i ought to blot out from my heart all those feelings that once were mine you may be right but then how could i or any of you defend ourselves if we did away with all these feelings now then you are talking sense says the teacher encouragingly we want other feelings and other views on life we want something new because we ourselves are a novelty in this life doubtless this is most important for us remarks the teacher why asks kanets is it not all the same whatever we say or think we have not got long to live i am forty you are fifty there is no one among us younger than thirty and even at twenty one cannot live such a life long and what kind of novelty are we asked abyedok mockingly since nakedness has always existed yes and it created rome said the teacher yes of course says the captain beaming with joy romulus and remus eh we also shall create when our time comes violation of public peace interrupts abyedok he laughs in a self satisfied way his laughter is impudent and insolent and is echoed by simtsoff the deacon and paltara taras the naive eyes of young meteor light up and his cheeks flush crimson kanets speaks and it seems as if he were hammering their heads all these are foolish illusions fiddle sticks it was strange to see them reasoning in this manner these outcasts from life tattered drunken with vodki and wickedness filthy and forlorn such conversations rejoiced the captain's heart they gave him an opportunity of speaking more and therefore he thought himself better than the rest however low he may fall a man can never deny himself the delight of feeling cleverer more powerful or even better fed than his companions aristid kuvalda abused this pleasure and never could have enough of it much to the disgust of abyedok kubar and others of these creatures that once were men who were less interested in such things politics however were more to the popular taste the discussions as to the necessity of taking india or of subduing england were lengthy and protracted nor did they speak with less enthusiasm of the radical measure of clearing jews off the face of the earth on this subject abyedok was always the first to propose dreadful plans to effect the desired end but the captain always first in every other argument did not join in this one they also spoke much and impudently about women but the teacher always defended them and sometimes was very angry when they went so far as to pass the limits of decency they all as a rule gave in to him because they did not look upon him as a common person and also because they wished to borrow from him on saturdays the money which he had earned during the week he had many privileges they never beat him for instance on these occasions when the conversation ended in a free fight he had the right to bring women into the dosshouse a privilege accorded to no one else as the captain had previously warned them no bringing of women to my house he had said women merchants and philosophers these are the three causes of my ruin i will horsewhip anyone bringing in women i will horsewhip the woman also and as to the philosopher i'll knock his head off for him and notwithstanding his age he could have knocked anyone's head off for he possessed wonderful strength besides that whenever he fought or quarrelled he was assisted by martyanoff who was accustomed during a general fight to stand silently and sadly back to back with kuvalda when he became an all destroying and impregnable engine of war once when simtsoff was drunk he rushed at the teacher for no reason whatever and getting hold of his head tore out a bunch of hair kuvalda with one stroke of his fist in the other's chest sent him spinning and he fell to the ground he was unconscious for almost half an hour and when he came to himself kuvalda compelled him to eat the hair he had torn from the teacher's head he ate it preferring this to being beaten to death besides reading newspapers fighting and indulging in general conversation they amused themselves by playing cards they played without martyanoff because he could not play honestly after cheating several times he openly confessed i cannot play without cheating"
