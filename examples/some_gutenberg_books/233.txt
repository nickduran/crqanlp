"1" "see as he passed a polished array of office fixtures much frosted glass clerks hard at work and genteel businessmen in nobby suits and clean linen lounging about or sitting in groups polished brass or nickel signs at the square stone entrances announced the firm and the nature of the business in rather neat and reserved terms the entire metropolitan centre possessed a high and mighty air calculated to overawe and abash the common applicant and to make the gulf between poverty and success seem both wide and deep into this important commercial region the timid carrie went she walked east along van buren street through a region of lessening importance until it deteriorated into a mass of shanties and coal yards and finally verged upon the river she walked bravely forward led by an honest desire to find employment and delayed at every step by the interest of the unfolding scene and a sense of helplessness amid so much evidence of power and force which she did not understand these vast buildings what were they these strange energies and huge interests for what purposes were they there she could have understood the meaning of a little stone cutter's yard at columbia city carving little pieces of marble for individual use but when the yards of some huge stone corporation came into view filled with spur tracks and flat cars transpierced by docks from the river and traversed overhead by immense trundling cranes of wood and steel it lost all significance in her little world it was so with the vast railroad yards with the crowded array of vessels she saw at the river and the huge factories over the way lining the water's edge through the open windows she could see the figures of men and women in working aprons moving busily about the great streets were wall lined mysteries to her the vast offices strange mazes which concerned far off individuals of importance she could only think of people connected with them as counting money dressing magnificently and riding in carriages what they dealt in how they laboured to what end it all came she had only the vaguest conception it was all wonderful all vast all far removed and she sank in spirit inwardly and fluttered feebly at the heart as she thought of entering any one of these mighty concerns and asking for something to do something that she could do anything chapter iii wee question of fortune four fifty a week once across the river and into the wholesale district she glanced about her for some likely door at which to apply as she contemplated the wide windows and imposing signs she became conscious of being gazed upon and understood for what she was a wage seeker she had never done this thing before and lacked courage to avoid a certain indefinable shame she felt at being caught spying about for a position she quickened her steps and assumed an air of indifference supposedly common to one upon an errand in this way she passed many manufacturing and wholesale houses without once glancing in at last after several blocks of walking she felt that this would not do and began to look about again though without relaxing her pace a little way on she saw a great door which for some reason attracted her attention it was ornamented by a small brass sign and seemed to be the entrance to a vast hive of six or seven floors perhaps she thought they may want some one and crossed over to enter when she came within a score of feet of the desired goal she saw through the window a young man in a grey checked suit that he had anything to do with the concern she could not tell but because he happened to be looking in her direction her weakening heart misgave her and she hurried by too overcome with shame to enter over the way stood a great six story structure labelled storm and king which she viewed with rising hope it was a wholesale dry goods concern and employed women she could see them moving about now and then upon the upper floors this place she decided to enter no matter what she crossed over and walked directly toward the entrance as she did so two men came out and paused in the door a telegraph messenger in blue dashed past her and up the few steps that led to the entrance and disappeared several pedestrians out of the hurrying throng which filled the sidewalks passed about her as she paused hesitating she looked helplessly around and then seeing herself observed retreated it was too difficult a task she could not go past them so severe a defeat told sadly upon her nerves her feet carried her mechanically forward every foot of her progress being a satisfactory portion of a flight which she gladly made block after block passed by upon streetlamps at the various corners she read names such as madison monroe la salle clark dearborn state and still she went her feet beginning to tire upon the broad stone flagging she was pleased in part that the streets were bright and clean the morning sun shining down with steadily increasing warmth made the shady side of the streets pleasantly cool she looked at the blue sky overhead with more realisation of its charm than had ever come to her before her cowardice began to trouble her in a way she turned back resolving to hunt up storm and king and enter on the way she encountered a great wholesale shoe company through the broad plate windows of which she saw an enclosed executive department hidden by frosted glass without this enclosure but just within the street entrance sat a grey haired gentleman at a small table with a large open ledger before him she walked by this institution several times hesitating but finding herself unobserved faltered past the screen door and stood humble waiting well young lady observed the old gentleman looking at her somewhat kindly what is it you wish i am that is do you i mean do you need any help she stammered not just at present he answered smiling not just at present come in some time next week occasionally we need some one she received the answer in silence and backed awkwardly out the pleasant nature of her reception rather astonished her she had expected that it would be more difficult that something cold and harsh would be said she knew not what that she had not been put to shame and made to feel her unfortunate position seemed remarkable somewhat encouraged she ventured into another large structure it was a clothing company and more people were in evidence well dressed men of forty and more surrounded by brass railings an office boy approached her who is it you wish to see he asked i want to see the manager she said he ran away and spoke to one of a group of three men who were conferring together one of these came towards her well he said coldly the greeting drove all courage from her at once do you need any help she stammered no he replied abruptly and turned upon his heel she went foolishly out the office boy deferentially swinging the door for her and gladly sank into the obscuring crowd it was a severe setback to her recently pleased mental state now she walked quite aimlessly for a time turning here and there seeing one great company after another but finding no courage to prosecute her single inquiry high noon came and with it hunger she hunted out an unassuming restaurant and entered but was disturbed to find that the prices were exorbitant for the size of her purse a bowl of soup was all that she could afford and with this quickly eaten she went out again it restored her strength somewhat and made her moderately bold to pursue the search in walking a few blocks to fix upon some probable place she again encountered the firm of storm and king and this time managed to get in some gentlemen were conferring close at hand but took no notice of her she was left standing gazing nervously upon the floor when the limit of her distress had been nearly reached she was beckoned to by a man at one of the many desks within the near by railing who is it you wish to see he required why any one if you please she answered i am looking for something to do oh you want to see mr mcmanus he returned sit down and he pointed to a chair against the neighbouring wall he went on leisurely writing until after a time a short stout gentleman came in from the street mr mcmanus called the man at the desk this young woman wants to see you the short gentleman turned about towards carrie and she arose and came forward what can i do for you miss he inquired surveying her curiously i want to know if i can get a position she inquired as what he asked not as anything in particular she faltered have you ever had any experience in the wholesale dry goods business he questioned no sir she replied are you a stenographer or typewriter no sir well we haven't anything here he said we employ only experienced help she began to step backward toward the door when something about her plaintive face attracted him have you ever worked at anything before he inquired no sir she said well now it's hardly possible that you would get anything to do in a wholesale house of this kind have you tried the department stores she acknowledged that she had not well if i were you he said looking at her rather genially i would try the department stores they often need young women as clerks thank you she said her whole nature relieved by this spark of friendly interest yes he said as she moved toward the door you try the department stores and off he went at that time the department store was in its earliest form of successful operation and there were not many the first three in the united states established about 1884 were in chicago carrie was familiar with the names of several through the advertisements in the daily news and now proceeded to seek them the words of mr mcmanus had somehow managed to restore her courage which had fallen low and she dared to hope that this new line would offer her something some time she spent in wandering up and down thinking to encounter the buildings by chance so readily is the mind bent upon prosecuting a hard but needful errand eased by that self deception which the semblance of search without the reality gives at last she inquired of a police officer and was directed to proceed two blocks up where she would find the fair the nature of these vast retail combinations should they ever permanently disappear will form an interesting chapter in the commercial history of our nation such a flowering out of a modest trade principle the world had never witnessed up to that time they were along the line of the most effective retail organisation with hundreds of stores coordinated into one and laid out upon the most imposing and economic basis they were handsome bustling successful affairs with a host of clerks and a swarm of patrons carrie passed along the busy aisles much affected by the remarkable displays of trinkets dress goods stationery and jewelry each separate counter was a show place of dazzling interest and attraction she could not help feeling the claim of each trinket and valuable upon her personally and yet she did not stop there was nothing there which she could not have used nothing which she did not long to own the dainty slippers and stockings the delicately frilled skirts and petticoats the laces ribbons hair combs purses all touched her with individual desire and she felt keenly the fact that not any of these things were in the range of her purchase she was a work seeker an outcast without employment one whom the average employee could tell at a glance was poor and in need of a situation it must not be thought that any one could have mistaken her for a nervous sensitive high strung nature cast unduly upon a cold calculating and unpoetic world such certainly she was not but women are peculiarly sensitive to their adornment not only did carrie feel the drag of desire for all which was new and pleasing in apparel for women but she noticed too with a touch at the heart the fine ladies who elbowed and ignored her brushing past in utter disregard of her presence themselves eagerly enlisted in the materials which the store contained carrie was not familiar with the appearance of her more fortunate sisters of the city neither had she before known the nature and appearance of the shop girls with whom she now compared poorly they were pretty in the main some even handsome with an air of independence and indifference which added in the case of the more favoured a certain piquancy their clothes were neat in many instances fine and wherever she encountered the eye of one it was only to recognise in it a keen analysis of her own position her individual shortcomings of dress and that shadow of manner which she thought must hang about her and make clear to all who and what she was a flame of envy lighted in her heart she realised in a dim way how much the city held wealth fashion ease every adornment for women and she longed for dress and beauty with a whole heart on the second floor were the managerial offices to which after some inquiry she was now directed there she found other girls ahead of her applicants like herself but with more of that self satisfied and independent air which experience of the city lends girls who scrutinised her in a painful manner after a wait of perhaps three quarters of an hour she was called in turn now said a sharp quick mannered jew who was sitting at a roll top desk near the window have you ever worked in any other store no sir said carrie oh you haven't he said eyeing her keenly no sir she replied well we prefer young women just now with some experience i guess we can't use you carrie stood waiting a moment hardly certain whether the interview had terminated don't wait he exclaimed remember we are very busy here carrie began to move quickly to the door hold on he said calling her back give me your name and address we want girls occasionally when she had gotten safely into the street she could scarcely restrain the tears it was not so much the particular rebuff which she had just experienced but the whole abashing trend of the day she was tired and nervous she abandoned the thought of appealing to the other department stores and now wandered on feeling a certain safety and relief in mingling with the crowd in her indifferent wandering she turned into jackson street not far from the river and was keeping her way along the south side of that imposing thoroughfare when a piece of wrapping paper written on with marking ink and tacked up on the door attracted her attention it read girls wanted wrappers stitchers she hesitated a moment then entered the firm of speigelheim co makers of boys caps occupied one floor of the building fifty feet in width and some eighty feet in depth it was a place rather dingily lighted the darkest portions having incandescent lights filled with machines and work benches at the latter laboured quite a company of girls and some men the former were drabby looking creatures stained in face with oil and dust clad in thin shapeless cotton dresses and shod with more or less worn shoes many of them had their sleeves rolled up revealing bare arms and in some cases owing to the heat their dresses were open at the neck they were a fair type of nearly the lowest order of shop girls careless slouchy and more or less pale from confinement they were not timid however were rich in curiosity and strong in daring and slang carrie looked about her very much disturbed and quite sure that she did not want to work here aside from making her uncomfortable by sidelong glances no one paid her the least attention she waited until the whole department was aware of her presence then some word was sent around and a foreman in an apron and shirt sleeves the latter rolled up to his shoulders approached do you want to see me he asked do you need any help said carrie already learning directness of address do you know how to stitch caps he returned no sir she replied have you ever had any experience at this kind of work he inquired she answered that she had not well said the foreman scratching his ear meditatively we do need a stitcher we like experienced help though we've hardly got time to break people in he paused and looked away out of the window we might though put you at finishing he concluded reflectively how much do you pay a week ventured carrie emboldened by a certain softness in the man's manner and his simplicity of address three and a half he answered oh she was about to exclaim but checked herself and allowed her thoughts to die without expression we're not exactly in need of anybody he went on vaguely looking her over as one would a package you can come on monday morning though he added and i'll put you to work thank you said carrie weakly if you come bring an apron he added he walked away and left her standing by the elevator never so much as inquiring her name while the appearance of the shop and the announcement of the price paid per week operated very much as a blow to carrie's fancy the fact that work of any kind was offered after so rude a round of experience was gratifying she could not begin to believe that she would take the place modest as her aspirations were she had been used to better than that her mere experience and the free out of door life of the country caused her nature to revolt at such confinement dirt had never been her share her sister's flat was clean this place was grimy and low the girls were careless and hardened they must be bad minded and hearted she imagined still a place had been offered her surely chicago was not so bad if she could find one place in one day she might find another and better later her subsequent experiences were not of a reassuring nature however from all the more pleasing or imposing places she was turned away abruptly with the most chilling formality in others where she applied only the experienced were required she met with painful rebuffs the most trying of which had been in a manufacturing cloak house where she had gone to the fourth floor to inquire no no said the foreman a rough heavily built individual who looked after a miserably lighted workshop we don't want any one don't come here with the wane of the afternoon went her hopes her courage and her strength she had been astonishingly persistent so earnest an effort was well deserving of a better reward on every hand to her fatigued senses the great business portion grew larger harder more stolid in its indifference it seemed as if it was all closed to her that the struggle was too fierce for her to hope to do anything at all men and women hurried by in long shifting lines she felt the flow of the tide of effort and interest felt her own helplessness without quite realising the wisp on the tide that she was she cast about vainly for some possible place to apply but found no door which she had the courage to enter it would be the same thing all over the old humiliation of her plea rewarded by curt denial sick at heart and in body she turned to the west the direction of minnie's flat which she had now fixed in mind and began that wearisome baffled retreat which the seeker for employment at nightfall too often makes in passing through fifth avenue south towards van buren street where she intended to take a car she passed the door of a large wholesale shoe house through the plate glass windows of which she could see a middle aged gentleman sitting at a small desk one of those forlorn impulses which often grow out of a fixed sense of defeat the last sprouting of a baffled and uprooted growth of ideas seized upon her she walked deliberately through the door and up to the gentleman who looked at her weary face with partially awakened interest what is it he said can you give me something to do said carrie now i really don't know he said kindly what kind of work is it you want you're not a typewriter are you oh no answered carrie well we only employ book keepers and typewriters here you might go around to the side and inquire upstairs they did want some help upstairs a few days ago ask for mr brown she hastened around to the side entrance and was taken up by the elevator to the fourth floor call mr brown willie said the elevator man to a boy near by willie went off and presently returned with the information that mr brown said she should sit down and that he would be around in a little while it was a portion of the stock room which gave no idea of the general character of the place and carrie could form no opinion of the nature of the work so you want something to do said mr brown after he inquired concerning the nature of her errand have you ever been employed in a shoe factory before no sir said carrie what is your name he inquired and being informed well i don't know as i have anything for you would you work for four and a half a week carrie was too worn by defeat not to feel that it was considerable she had not expected that he would offer her less than six she acquiesced however and he took her name and address well he said finally you report here at eight o'clock monday morning i think i can find something for you to do he left her revived by the possibilities sure that she had found something at last instantly the blood crept warmly over her body her nervous tension relaxed she walked out into the busy street and discovered a new atmosphere behold the throng was moving with a lightsome step she noticed that men and women were smiling scraps of conversation and notes of laughter floated to her the air was light people were already pouring out of the buildings their labour ended for the day she noticed that they were pleased and thoughts of her sister's home and the meal that would be awaiting her quickened her steps she hurried on tired perhaps but no longer weary of foot what would not minnie say ah the long winter in chicago the lights the crowd the amusement this was a great pleasing metropolis after all her new firm was a goodly institution its windows were of huge plate glass she could probably do well there thoughts of drouet returned of the things he had told her she now felt that life was better that it was livelier sprightlier she boarded a car in the best of spirits feeling her blood still flowing pleasantly she would live in chicago her mind kept saying to itself she would have a better time than she had ever had before she would be happy chapter iv the spendings of fancy facts answer with sneers for the next two days carrie indulged in the most high flown speculations her fancy plunged recklessly into privileges and amusements which would have been much more becoming had she been cradled a child of fortune with ready will and quick mental selection she scattered her meagre four fifty per week with a swift and graceful hand indeed as she sat in her rocking chair these several evenings before going to bed and looked out upon the pleasantly lighted street this money cleared for its prospective possessor the way to every joy and every bauble which the heart of woman may desire i will have a fine time she thought her sister minnie knew nothing of these rather wild cerebrations though they exhausted the markets of delight she was too busy scrubbing the kitchen woodwork and calculating the purchasing power of eighty cents for sunday's dinner when carrie had returned home flushed with her first success and ready for all her weariness to discuss the now interesting events which led up to her achievement the former had merely smiled approvingly and inquired whether she would have to spend any of it for car fare this consideration had not entered in before and it did not now for long affect the glow of carrie's enthusiasm disposed as she then was to calculate upon that vague basis which allows the subtraction of one sum from another without any perceptible diminution she was happy when hanson came home at seven o'clock he was inclined to be a little crusty his usual demeanour before supper this never showed so much in anything he said as in a certain solemnity of countenance and the silent manner in which he slopped about he had a pair of yellow carpet slippers which he enjoyed wearing and these he would immediately substitute for his solid pair of shoes this and washing his face with the aid of common washing soap until it glowed a shiny red constituted his only preparation for his evening meal he would then get his evening paper and read in silence for a young man this was rather a morbid turn of character and so affected carrie indeed it affected the entire atmosphere of the flat as such things are inclined to do and gave to his wife's mind its subdued and tactful turn anxious to avoid taciturn replies under the influence of carrie's announcement he brightened up somewhat you didn't lose any time did you he remarked smiling a little no returned carrie with a touch of pride he asked her one or two more questions and then turned to play with the baby leaving the subject until it was brought up again by minnie at the table carrie however was not to be reduced to the common level of observation which prevailed in the flat it seems to be such a large company she said at one place great big plate glass windows and lots of clerks the man i saw said they hired ever so many people it's not very hard to get work now put in hanson if you look right minnie under the warming influence of carrie's good spirits and her husband's somewhat conversational mood began to tell carrie of some of the well known things to see things the enjoyment of which cost nothing you'd like to see michigan avenue there are such fine houses it is such a fine street where is h r jacob's interrupted carrie mentioning one of the theatres devoted to melodrama which went by that name at the time oh it's not very far from here answered minnie it's in halstead street right up here how i'd like to go there i crossed halstead street to day didn't i at this there was a slight halt in the natural reply thoughts are a strangely permeating factor at her suggestion of going to the theatre the unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing of those things which involved the expenditure of money shades of feeling which arose in the mind of hanson and then in minnie slightly affected the atmosphere of the table minnie answered yes but carrie could feel that going to the theatre was poorly advocated here the subject was put off for a little while until hanson through with his meal took his paper and went into the front room when they were alone the two sisters began a somewhat freer conversation carrie interrupting it to hum a little as they worked at the dishes i should like to walk up and see halstead street if it isn't too far said carrie after a time why don't we go to the theatre to night oh i don't think sven would want to go to night returned minnie he has to get up so early he wouldn't mind he'd enjoy it said carrie no he doesn't go very often returned minnie well i'd like to go rejoined carrie let's you and me go minnie pondered a while not upon whether she could or would go for that point was already negatively settled with her but upon some means of diverting the thoughts of her sister to some other topic we'll go some other time she said at last finding no ready means of escape carrie sensed the root of the opposition at once i have some money she said you go with me minnie shook her head he could go along said carrie no returned minnie softly and rattling the dishes to"
