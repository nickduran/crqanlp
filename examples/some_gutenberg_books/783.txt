"1" "a journey to the far away stars a shrieking blast of wind served to briefly clear away the choking dust affording the trio a fleeting glimpse of their immediate surroundings hurtling sticks and stones splintered tops of trees shrubs with wildly lashing roots freshly torn from the bed of years all madly spinning through a blinding scorching freezing mass of crazily battling winds the different currents twining and weaving in and out as so many hideous serpents at play a moment thus then that horrid uproar grew still more deafening and the air ship was whirled high and higher in a dizzy dance those luckless creatures clinging fast to whatever their frenzied hands might clutch feeling that this was the end of all further sight was denied them they were powerless to move a limb save as jerked painfully by those shrieking currents breath was taken away and an enormous weight bore down upon them threatening to produce a fatal collapse through their ribs giving way upward whirled the flying machine powerless now as those wretched beings within its cunning shape smitten sharply here and there by some of those ascending missiles yet without receiving material injury until a last shivering lurch came ending in a sudden fall a dizzying swoop downward but not to death and destruction for the aerostat alighted easily upon what appeared to be a sort of air cushion and though unsteady for a brief space then settled upon an even keel cling fast for life huskily gasped the professor unwittingly repeating the caution which had last crossed his lips which he had ever since been striving to enunciate faithful to his guardianship over these his sole surviving relatives i don't where are we waldo lifted his head to peer with half blind eyes about them in which action he was imitated by both brother and uncle but for a brief space they were none the wiser all around the aeromotor rose a wall of whirling winds seemingly impenetrable apparently within reach of an extended arm changing colour with each fraction of a second hideously beautiful yet never twice the same in blend or mixture a hollow strangely sounding roar was perceptible one instant coming as from the far distance then from nigh at hand causing the air ship to quiver and tremble as a sentient being might in the presence of a torturing death look upward panted bruno a few seconds later his face as pale as that of a corpse in spite of the dirt and blotches of sticky mud with which he had been peppered during that dizzy whirl mechanically his companions in peril obeyed catching breath sharply as they saw a clear sky and yellow sunshine far above so awfully far they were that it seemed like looking upward from the bottom of an enormously deep well and then the marvellous truth flashed upon the brain of phaeton featherwit almost robbing him of all power of speech still he managed to jerkily ejaculate we're inside riding the tornado itself then those whirling winds closed quickly above them shutting out the sunlight hiding the heavens from their view enclosing that vehicle and its occupants as they were borne away into unknown regions within the very heart of the tornado itself yet incredible as it surely seems no actual harm came to the trio or to their flying machine as it swayed gently upon its airy cushion although from every side came the horrid roar of destruction while ever and anon they could glimpse a wrestling tree or torn mass of shrubbery whizzing upward and outward to be flung far away beyond the vortex of electrical winds once more came that awful sense of suffocation that painted pall closed down upon them robbing their lungs of air one instant fairly crisping their hair with a touch of fire only to send an icy chill to their veins a moment later in vain they struggled fighting for breath as a fish gasps when swung from its native element while that horrid pressure endured man youth and boy alike were powerless again the pall lifted folding back and blending with those madly circling currents once again affording a glimpse of yonder far away heavens so marvellously clear and bright and peaceful in seeming weakened by those terrible moments bruno and waldo lay gasping trembling faint of heart and ill of body yet filling their lungs with comparatively pure air pity there was so little of it to win professor featherwit still had thought and care for his nephews rather than himself alone and pantingly spoke as he dragged himself to the snug locker where many important articles had been stowed away here suck life compressed air with husky cries the brothers caught at the tubes offered the method of working which had so often been explained by their relative once more the tube became a chamber and that horrid force threatened to flatten their bodies but the worst had passed for that precious cylinder now gave them air to inhale and they were enabled to wait for the lifting of the cloud once more thanks to this important agency strength and energy both of body and of mind now came back to the air voyagers and after a little they could lift their heads to peer around them with growing wonder and curiosity there was little room left for doubting the wondrous truth and yet belief was past their powers during those first few minutes all around them whirled and sped those maddened winds curling and twisting rising and falling mixing in and out as though some unknown power might be weaving the web of destiny now dull now brilliant never twice the same but ever changing in colour as in shape while stripes and zigzags of lightning played here and there with terrifying menace those walls of wind held an awfully fascinating power for uncle and nephews from every side came deadened sounds which could bear but a single interpretation the tornado was still in rapid motion was still tearing and rending crushing and battering leaving dire destruction and ruin to mark its advance and these were the sounds that recorded its ugly work in goodly measure revived by the compressed air which was regulated in flow to suit his requirements by a device of his own professor featherwit now looked around with something of his wonted animation heedless of his own peril for the moment so great was his interest in this marvellous happening so utterly incredible was it all that during those first few minutes of rallying powers he dared not express the belief which was shaping itself gazing around in quest of still further confirmation he took note of the windy walls about their vessel rising upward for many yards irregular in shape and curvature here and there but retaining the general semblance of a tube with flaring top he peered over the edge of the basket to draw back dizzily as he saw naught but yeasty boiling seething clouds below a veritable air cushion which had served to save the pet of his brain from utter destruction at the time of falling within yes there was no longer room for doubt they were actually inside the distorted balloon so dreaded by all residents of the tornado belt what is it uncle huskily asked bruno likewise rallying under that beneficial influence where are we now where i'm wishing mighty hard we wasn't anyhow contributed waldo with something of his usual energy although judging from his face and eyes the youngster had suffered more severely than either of his comrades in peril professor featherwit broke into a queerly sounding laugh as he waved his free hand in exultation before speaking where no living being ever was before us my lads riding the tornado like a ugh the air ship gave an awkward lurch just then and down went the little professor to thump his head heavily against one corner of the locker swaying drunkenly from side to side then tossing up and down turning in unison with those fiercely whirling clouds the aeromotor seemed at the point of wreck and ruin desperately the trio clung to the life lines clenching teeth upon the life giving tubes as that terrible pressure increased so much that it seemed impossible for the human frame to longer resist fortunately that ordeal did not long endure and again relief came to those so sorely oppressed a brief gasping sighing stretching as the aerostat resumed its level position merely rocking easily within that partial vacuum and then waldo huskily suggested looks like the blame thing was sick at the stomach no doubt this was meant for a feeble attempt at joking but professor featherwit took it for earnest and made quick reply that is precisely the case my dear lad and i am greatly joyed to find that you are not so badly frightened but that you can assist me in taking notes of this wondrous happening to think that we are the ones selected for i say uncle phaeton well my lad if this thing is really sick at the stomach when will it erupt i'd give a dollar and a half to just get out o this science or no science notes or no notes at all patience my dear boy gravely spoke the little man of science busily studying those eddying currents like one seeking a fairly safe method of extrication from peril it may come far sooner than you think and with results more disastrous than feeble words can tell we surely are a burden such as a tornado must be wholly unaccustomed to and i really believe these alternations are spasmodic efforts of the cloud itself to vomit us forth hence you were nearer right than you thought in making use of that expression just then came a rush of icy air and bruno pantingly cried i'm swelling up like aesop's bullfrog chapter iv the professor's little experiment again those involuntary riders of the tornado were tossed violently to and fro in their seemingly frail ship while the balloon itself appeared threatened with instant dissolution those eddying currents growing broken and far less regular in action while the fierce tumult grew in sound and volume a thousandfold all around the air ship now showed ugly debris limbs and boughs and even whole trunks of giant trees being whirled upward and outward each moment menacing the vessel with total destruction yet as frequently vanishing without infringing seriously upon their curious prison sand and dirt and fragments of shattered rock whistled by in an apparently unending shower only with reversed motion flying upward in place of shooting downward to earth itself speech was utterly impossible under the circumstances and the fate tossed voyagers could only cling fast to the hand rail and hold those precious air tubes in readiness for the worst never before had either of the trio heard such a deafening crash and uproar and little wonder if they thought this surely must herald the crack of doom the tornado seemed to reel backward as though repulsed by an immovable obstacle and then while the din was a bit less deafening professor featherwit contrived to make himself heard through screaming at the top of his voice the mountain range i fancy it's a battle to the that sentence was perforce left incomplete since the storm demon gave another mad plunge to renew the battle bringing on a repetition of that drunken swaying so upsetting to both mind and body a few seconds thus then the tornado conquered or else rose higher in partial defeat for their progress was resumed and comparative quiet reigned again the higher clouds curved backward affording a wider view of the heavens far above and as all eyes turned instinctively in that direction bruno involuntarily exclaimed still daylight i thought how long has this lasted it's the middle o next week no less positively affirmed his brother don't tell me we've been in here a solid month by my watch instead of making reply such as might have been expected from one of his mathematical exactness professor featherwit gave a cry of dismay while hurriedly moving to and fro in their contracted quarters for the time being forgetful of all other than this his great loss what is it uncle phaeton asked bruno rising to his knees in natural anxiety surely nothing worse than has already happened to us worse what could be worse than losing for ever the camera boys where is the camera i ask you certainly not where the professor was looking and even as he roared forth that query his heart told him the sad truth past doubting the instrument upon whose aid he relied to place upon record these marvellous facts so that all mankind might see and have full faith was lost thrown from the aerostat to meet with certain destruction when the vessel first came within the tornado's terrible clutch gone lost and now who will believe that we ever oh this is enough to crush one's very soul mourned the professor throwing up his hands and sinking back to the floor of the flying machine in a limp and disheartened heap for the time being neither bruno nor waldo could fully appreciate that grief since thoughts and care for self were still the ruling passion with both but once more they were called upon to do battle with the swaying of the winds and once again were they saved only through that life giving cylinder of compressed air presently the heart broken professor rallied as was his nature and with a visible effort putting his great loss behind him endeavoured to cheer up his comrades in peril so far we have passed through all danger without receiving material injury to ourselves i mean and surely it is not too much to hope for eventual escape he said earnestly pressing the hands of his nephews by way of additional encouragement yes hesitated bruno with an involuntary shiver as he glanced around them upon those furiously boiling clouds then cast an eye upward towards yonder clear sky yes but in what manner what'll we do when the cyclone goes bu'st cut in waldo with disagreeable bluntness it can't go on for ever and when it splits up where will we be then i wish it lay within my power to give you full assurance on all points my dear boys the professor made reply i only wish i could ensure your perfect safety by giving my own poor remnant of life no no uncle phaeton cried the brothers in a single breath how cheerfully if i only might insisted the professor his homely face wearing an expression of blended regret and unbounded affection but for me you would never have encountered these perils nor ever again he was interrupted by the brothers and forced to leave that regret unspoken to the end only for you uncle phaeton what would have become of us when we were left without parents home fortune only for you taking us in and treating us as though of your own flesh and blood as you are my good lads let it pass then but i must say that i do wish well well let it pass then a brief silence which was spent in gripping hands and with eyes giving pledges of love and undying confidence then professor featherwit spoke again in an entirely different vein if nothing else we have exploded one fallacy which has never met with contradiction so far as my poor knowledge goes and that is what uncle phaeton observe my lads with a wave of his hand towards those whirling walls and then making a downward motion you see that we are floating in a partial vacuum yet where there is air sufficient to preserve life under difficulties and by looking downward careful that you don't fall overboard through dizziness though looks as though we were floating just above a bed of ugly wind declared waldo after taking a look below precisely the aerostat rests upon an air cushion amply solid enough to sustain far more than our combined weight but what is the generally accepted view my dear boys you tell for we don't know how frankly acknowledged waldo thanks yet you are now far wiser than all of the scientists who have written and published whole libraries concerning these storm formations but whose fallacies we are now fully prepared to explode once for all through knowledge won by personal investigation ahem strange though it may appear the professor forgot the mutual danger by which they were surrounded and trotted off on his hobby horse in blissful pride paying no attention to the hideous uproar going on only raising his voice higher to make it heard by his youthful auditors the common belief is that while these tornadoes are hollow even through the trunk or tongue down to its contact with the earth that hollow is caused by a constant suction through which a steady stream of debris is flowing to be sown broadcast for miles around after emerging from the open top of the so called balloon but it isn't at all like that eagerly cried waldo pointing to where the fragments were flowing upward through those walls themselves yet far enough from that hollow interior to be but indistinctly seen save on rare occasions look at em scoot will ye oh if we could only climb up like that professor featherwit was keenly watching and closely studying that very phenomena through all and now he gave a queer little chuckle as he nodded his head with vigour before dryly speaking well it might be done yes it might be done and that with no very serious difficulty my lad how why not try it on then to meet with instant death outside sharply queried bruno it would be suicidal to make the attempt even if we could which i doubt waldo gave a sudden cry pointing upward where far above that destructive storm could be seen a brace of buzzards floating on motionless wings wholly undisturbed by the tumult below if we were only like that the lad cried longingly if a flying machine could be built like those turkey buzzards i wish well i do suppose they're about the nastiest varmints ever hatched but just now i'd be willing to swap and wouldn't ask any boot either apparently the professor paid no attention to this boyish plaint for he was fumbling in the locker then withdrew his hand and uncoiled an ordinary fish line with painted float attached before either brother could ask a question or even give a guess at his purpose professor phaeton flung hook and cork into those circling currents only to have the whole jerked violently out of his grip the line flying upward to vanish from the sight of all that jerk was powerful enough to cut through the skin of his hand but the professor chuckled like one delighted as he sucked away the few drops of blood before adding i knew it it can be done and if the worst should come to pass why should it not be done before an answer could be vouchsafed by either of the brothers the pall swooped down upon them once more and again the supply of natural air was shut off while their vessel was rocked and swayed crazily just as though the delayed end was at last upon them for several minutes this torture endured each second of which appeared to be an hour to those imperilled beings who surely must have perished as they lay pinned fast to the floor of the aerostat by that pitiless weight only for the precious air tubes in connection with that cylinder of compressed air after a seeming age of torment the awful pressure was relaxed leaving the trio gasping and shivering as they lay side by side barely conscious that life lingered for the moment unable to lift hand or head to aid either self or another in spite of his far greater age professor featherwit was first to rally and his voice was about the first thing distinguished by the brothers as their powers began to rally shall we take our chances dear boys the professor was saying in earnest tones i believe there is a method of escaping from this hell chamber although of what may lie beyond it can't well be worse than this huskily gasped bruno anything everything just to get out o here supplemented waldo for once all spirits subdued it may be death for us all even if we do get outside gravely warned the professor bear that in mind dear boys it may be that not one of us will escape with life after how much better to remain here interrupted bruno i felt death would be a mercy then and i'd risk anything everything rather than go through such another ordeal i say escape me too all over vigorously decided waldo lifting himself to both knees as he added tell us what to do and here i am on deck uncle even now professor phaeton hesitated his eyes growing dimmer than usual as they rested upon one face after the other for right well he knew how deadly would be the peril thus invited but as the brothers repeated their cry he turned away to swiftly knot a strong trail rope to a heavy iron grapnel leaving the other end firmly attached to a stanchion built for that express purpose hold fast if you value life at all dear boys he warned then added heaven be kind to you even if my life pays the forfeit now without further delay he cast the heavy grapnel into that mass of boiling vapour then fell flat as an awful jerk was given the aerostat chapter v the professor's unknown land there was neither time nor opportunity for taking notes for that long rope straightened out in the fraction of a second throwing all prostrate as the flying machine was jerked upward with awful force all around them raged and roared the mighty winds while missiles of almost every description pelted and pounded both machine and inmates during those few seconds of extraordinary peril fortunately neither the professor nor his nephews could fairly realise just what was taking place else their brains would hardly have stood the test and fortunately too that ordeal was not protracted a hideous experience while it lasted those vicious currents dragging the aerostat upward out of the air chamber by means of grapnel and rope then casting all far away in company with wrecked trees and bushes and even solider materials all shrouded for a time in dust and debris which hindered the eyesight of both uncle and nephews through it all the brothers were dimly aware of one fact uncle phaeton was shrilly bidding them cling fast and have courage all at once they felt as though vomited forth from a volcano which alternately breathed fire and ice the clear light of evening bursting upon their aching smarting eyes with actual pain while that horrid roar of warring elements seemed to pass away in the distance leaving them where and how we're falling to merciful heavens hold fast all screamed the professor desperately striving to regain full command of their air ship the tiller is jammed but to all seeming the aerostat had sustained some fatal damage during that brief eruption caused by the professor's little experiment for it was pitching drunkenly end for end refusing to obey the hand of its builder bearing all to certain death upon the earth far below half stupefied with fear the brothers clung fast to the life line and glared downward noting in spite of themselves how swiftly yonder dark tree tops and gray crags were shooting heavenward to meet them and claim the sacrifice with fierce energy professor featherwit jerked and wrenched at the steering gear uttering words such as had long been foreign to his lips but then just when destruction appeared inevitable a wild cry burst from his lungs as a broken bit of native wood came away in his left hand leaving the lever free as of old and then with a dizzying swoop and rapid recovery the gallant air ship came back to an even keel sailing along with old time grace and ease barely in time to avoid worse mishap as the crest of a tall tree was brushed in their passage saved saved my lads screamed the professor as his heart pet soared upward once more until well past the danger line safe and sound through all praises be unto the lord our father neither brother spoke just then for they lay there in half stupor barely able to realise the wondrous truth that their lives had surely been spared them even as by a miracle that swooping turn now brought their faces towards the tornado which was at least a couple of miles distant rapidly making that distance greater even while continuing its work of destruction and we were in it huskily muttered bruno his lids closing with a shiver as he averted his face unwilling to see more heap sight worse than being in the soup too if anybody asks you declared waldo beginning to rally both in strength and in spirit but what's the matter with the old ship uncle phaeton for the aerostat was indulging itself in sundry distressing gyrations pretty much as a boy's kite swoops from side to side when lacking in tail ballast while the professor seemed unable to keep the machine under complete control nothing serious only hold fast all i believe twould be as well to make our descent for fear something steady just ahead there appeared a more than usually open space in the forest and quite as much by good luck as through actual skill professor featherwit succeeded in making a landing with no more serious mishap than sundry bruises and a little extra teeth jarring as quickly as possible both bruno and waldo pitched themselves out of the partially disabled aeromotor the elder brother grasping the grapnel and taking a couple of turns of the strong rope around a convenient tree trunk lest the ship escape them altogether no need my gallant boy assured the professor an instant later all is well all is well thanks to an over ruling providence in spite of this expressed confidence he hurriedly looked over his pet machine taking note of such injuries as had been received during that remarkable journey only giving over when fairly satisfied that all damage might be readily made good after which the aerostat would be as trustworthy as upon its first voyage on high then grasping the brothers each by a hand he smiled genially then lifted eyes heavenward to a moment later sink upon his knees with bowed head and hands folded across his bosom bruno and waldo imitated his action and though no audible words were spoken never were more heartfelt prayers sent upward never more grateful thanks given unto the most high boy youth and man alike seemed fairly awed into silence for the next few minutes unable to so soon cast off the spell which had fallen upon them one and each when realising how mercifully their lives had been spared even after all earthly hope had been abandoned as usual however waldo was first to rally and after silently moving around the aerostat upon which the professor was already busily at work by the last gleams of the vanished sun he paused legs separated and hands thrust deep into pockets head perking on one side as he spoke drawlingly i say uncle phaeton what is it waldo it'll never do to breathe even a hint of all this will it why so pray whoever heard it would swear we were bald headed liars right from storytown and yet did it really happen or have i been dreaming all the way through professor featherwit gave a brief dry chuckle at this rising erect to cast a deliberate glance around their present location then speaking without i am greatly mistaken my dear boy you will have still other marvellous happenings to relate ere we return to what is rightfully or wrongfully called civilisation is that so then you really reckon for one thing my lad we are now fairly entered upon a terra incognita so far as our own race is concerned in other words behold the olympics both bruno and waldo cast their eyes around but only a circumscribed view was theirs the shades of evening were settling fast and on all sides they could see but mighty trees rugged rocks a mountain stream from whose pebbly bed came a soothing murmur nothing so mighty much to brag of anyway irreverently quoth waldo after that short lived scrutiny it wouldn't fetch a dollar an acre at auction and for my part wonder when the gong will sound for supper that blunt hint was effective and letting the subject drop for the time being even the professor joined in the hurry for an evening meal to which one and all felt able to do full justice although some rain had fallen at this point as well no serious difficulty was experienced in kindling a fire while waldo had little trouble in heaping up a bounteous supply of fuel through countless ages the forest monarchs had been shedding their superfluous boughs while here and there lay an entire tree overthrown by some unknown power and upon which the brothers made heavy requisition professor featherwit took from the locker a supply of tinned goods together with a patent coffee pot and frying pan so convenient where
