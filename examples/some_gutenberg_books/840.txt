"1" "but i being muddled with much doubt about john fry and his errand was only stripped of my jerkin and waistcoat and not comfortable to begin come now shake hands cried a big boy jumping in joy of the spectacle a third former nearly six feet high shake hands you little devils keep your pluck up and show good sport and lord love the better man of you robin took me by the hand and gazed at me disdainfully and then smote me painfully in the face ere i could get my fence up whutt be bout lad cried john fry hutt un again jan wull e well done then our jan boy for i had replied to robin now with all the weight and cadence of penthemimeral caesura a thing the name of which i know but could never make head nor tail of it and the strife began in a serious style and the boys looking on were not cheated although i could not collect their shouts when the blows were ringing upon me it was no great loss for john fry told me afterwards that their oaths went up like a furnace fire but to these we paid no heed or hap being in the thick of swinging and devoid of judgment all i know is i came to my corner when the round was over with very hard pumps in my chest and a great desire to fall away time is up cried head monitor ere ever i got my breath again and when i fain would have lingered awhile on the knee of the boy that held me john fry had come up and the boys were laughing because he wanted a stable lanthorn and threatened to tell my mother time is up cried another boy more headlong than head monitor if we count three before the come of thee thwacked thou art and must go to the women i felt it hard upon me he began to count one too three but before the three was out of his mouth i was facing my foe with both hands up and my breath going rough and hot and resolved to wait the turn of it for i had found seat on the knee of a boy sage and skilled to tutor me who knew how much the end very often differs from the beginning a rare ripe scholar he was and now he hath routed up the germans in the matter of criticism sure the clever boys and men have most love towards the stupid ones finish him off bob cried a big boy and that i noticed especially because i thought it unkind of him after eating of my toffee as he had that afternoon finish him off neck and crop he deserves it for sticking up to a man like you but i was not so to be finished off though feeling in my knuckles now as if it were a blueness and a sense of chilblain nothing held except my legs and they were good to help me so this bout or round if you please was foughten warily by me with gentle recollection of what my tutor the clever boy had told me and some resolve to earn his praise before i came back to his knee again and never i think in all my life sounded sweeter words in my ears except when my love loved me than when my second and backer who had made himself part of my doings now and would have wept to see me beaten said famously done jack famously only keep your wind up jack and you'll go right through him meanwhile john fry was prowling about asking the boys what they thought of it and whether i was like to be killed because of my mother's trouble but finding now that i had foughten three score fights already he came up to me woefully in the quickness of my breathing while i sat on the knee of my second with a piece of spongious coralline to ease me of my bloodshed and he says in my ears as if he was clapping spurs into a horse never thee knack under jan or never coom naigh hexmoor no more with that it was all up with me a simmering buzzed in my heavy brain and a light came through my eyeplaces at once i set both fists again and my heart stuck to me like cobbler's wax either robin snell should kill me or i would conquer robin snell so i went in again with my courage up and bob came smiling for victory and i hated him for smiling he let at me with his left hand and i gave him my right between his eyes and he blinked and was not pleased with it i feared him not and spared him not neither spared myself my breath came again and my heart stood cool and my eyes struck fire no longer only i knew that i would die sooner than shame my birthplace how the rest of it was i know not only that i had the end of it and helped to put robin in bed chapter iii the war path of the doones from tiverton town to the town of oare is a very long and painful road and in good truth the traveller must make his way as the saying is for the way is still unmade at least on this side of dulverton although there is less danger now than in the time of my schooling for now a good horse may go there without much cost of leaping but when i was a boy the spurs would fail when needed most by reason of the slough cake it is to the credit of this age and our advance upon fatherly ways that now we have laid down rods and fagots and even stump oaks here and there so that a man in good daylight need not sink if he be quite sober there is nothing i have striven at more than doing my duty way warden over exmoor but in those days when i came from school and good times they were too full of a warmth and fine hearth comfort which now are dying out it was a sad and sorry business to find where lay the highway we are taking now to mark it off with a fence on either side at least when a town is handy but to me this seems of a high pretence and a sort of landmark and channel for robbers though well enough near london where they have earned a race course we left the town of the two fords which they say is the meaning of it very early in the morning after lying one day to rest as was demanded by the nags sore of foot and foundered for my part too i was glad to rest having aches all over me and very heavy bruises and we lodged at the sign of the white horse inn in the street called gold street opposite where the souls are of john and joan greenway set up in gold letters because we must take the homeward way at cockcrow of the morning though still john fry was dry with me of the reason of his coming and only told lies about father and could not keep them agreeable i hoped for the best as all boys will especially after a victory and i thought perhaps father had sent for me because he had a good harvest and the rats were bad in the corn chamber it was high noon before we were got to dulverton that day near to which town the river exe and its big brother barle have union my mother had an uncle living there but we were not to visit his house this time at which i was somewhat astonished since we needs must stop for at least two hours to bait our horses thorough well before coming to the black bogway the bogs are very good in frost except where the hot springs rise but as yet there had been no frost this year save just enough to make the blackbirds look big in the morning in a hearty black frost they look small until the snow falls over them the road from bampton to dulverton had not been very delicate yet nothing to complain of much no deeper indeed than the hocks of a horse except in the rotten places the day was inclined to be mild and foggy and both nags sweated freely but peggy carrying little weight for my wardrobe was upon smiler and john fry grumbling always we could easily keep in front as far as you may hear a laugh john had been rather bitter with me which methought was a mark of ill taste at coming home for the holidays and yet i made allowance for john because he had never been at school and never would have chance to eat fry upon condition of spelling it therefore i rode on thinking that he was hard set like a saw for his dinner and would soften after tooth work and yet at his most hungry times when his mind was far gone upon bacon certes he seemed to check himself and look at me as if he were sorry for little things coming over great but now at dulverton we dined upon the rarest and choicest victuals that ever i did taste even now at my time of life to think of it gives me appetite as once and awhile to think of my first love makes me love all goodness hot mutton pasty was a thing i had often heard of from very wealthy boys and men who made a dessert of dinner and to hear them talk of it made my lips smack and my ribs come inwards and now john fry strode into the hostel with the air and grace of a short legged man and shouted as loud as if he was calling sheep upon exmoor hot mooton pasty for twoo trarv'lers at number vaive in vaive minnits dish un up in the tin with the grahvy zame as i hardered last tuesday of course it did not come in five minutes nor yet in ten or twenty but that made it all the better when it came to the real presence and the smell of it was enough to make an empty man thank god for the room there was inside him fifty years have passed me quicker than the taste of that gravy it is the manner of all good boys to be careless of apparel and take no pride in adornment good lack if i see a boy make to do about the fit of his crumpler and the creasing of his breeches and desire to be shod for comeliness rather than for use i cannot scape the mark that god took thought to make a girl of him not so when they grow older and court the regard of the maidens then may the bravery pass from the inside to the outside of them and no bigger fools are they even then than their fathers were before them but god forbid any man to be a fool to love and be loved as i have been else would he have prevented it when the mutton pasty was done and peggy and smiler had dined well also out i went to wash at the pump being a lover of soap and water at all risk except of my dinner and john fry who cared very little to wash save sabbath days in his own soap and who had kept me from the pump by threatening loss of the dish out he came in a satisfied manner with a piece of quill in his hand to lean against a door post and listen to the horses feeding and have his teeth ready for supper then a lady's maid came out and the sun was on her face and she turned round to go back again but put a better face upon it and gave a trip and hitched her dress and looked at the sun full body lest the hostlers should laugh that she was losing her complexion with a long italian glass in her fingers very daintily she came up to the pump in the middle of the yard where i was running the water off all my head and shoulders and arms and some of my breast even and though i had glimpsed her through the sprinkle it gave me quite a turn to see her child as i was in my open aspect but she looked at me no whit abashed making a baby of me no doubt as a woman of thirty will do even with a very big boy when they catch him on a hayrick and she said to me in a brazen manner as if i had been nobody while i was shrinking behind the pump and craving to get my shirt on good leetle boy come hither to me fine heaven how blue your eyes are and your skin like snow but some naughty man has beaten it black oh leetle boy let me feel it ah how then it must have hurt you there now and you shall love me all this time she was touching my breast here and there very lightly with her delicate brown fingers and i understood from her voice and manner that she was not of this country but a foreigner by extraction and then i was not so shy of her because i could talk better english than she and yet i longed for my jerkin but liked not to be rude to her if you please madam i must go john fry is waiting by the tapster's door and peggy neighing to me if you please we must get home to night and father will be waiting for me this side of the telling house there there you shall go leetle dear and perhaps i will go after you i have taken much love of you but the baroness is hard to me how far you call it now to the bank of the sea at wash wash at watchett likely you mean madam oh a very long way and the roads as soft as the road to oare oh ah oh ah i shall remember that is the place where my leetle boy live and some day i will come seek for him now make the pump to flow my dear and give me the good water the baroness will not touch unless a nebule be formed outside the glass i did not know what she meant by that yet i pumped for her very heartily and marvelled to see her for fifty times throw the water away in the trough as if it was not good enough at last the water suited her with a likeness of fog outside the glass and the gleam of a crystal under it and then she made a curtsey to me in a sort of mocking manner holding the long glass by the foot not to take the cloud off and then she wanted to kiss me but i was out of breath and have always been shy of that work except when i come to offer it and so i ducked under the pump handle and she knocked her chin on the knob of it and the hostlers came out and asked whether they would do as well upon this she retreated up the yard with a certain dark dignity and a foreign way of walking which stopped them at once from going farther because it was so different from the fashion of their sweethearts one with another they hung back where half a cart load of hay was and they looked to be sure that she would not turn round and then each one laughed at the rest of them now up to the end of dulverton town on the northward side of it where the two new pig sties be the oare folk and the watchett folk must trudge on together until we come to a broken cross where a murdered man lies buried peggy and smiler went up the hill as if nothing could be too much for them after the beans they had eaten and suddenly turning a corner of trees we happened upon a great coach and six horses labouring very heavily john fry rode on with his hat in his hand as became him towards the quality but i was amazed to that degree that i left my cap on my head and drew bridle without knowing it for in the front seat of the coach which was half way open being of the city make and the day in want of air sate the foreign lady who had met me at the pump and offered to salute me by her side was a little girl dark haired and very wonderful with a wealthy softness on her as if she must have her own way i could not look at her for two glances and she did not look at me for one being such a little child and busy with the hedges but in the honourable place sate a handsome lady very warmly dressed and sweetly delicate of colour and close to her was a lively child two or it may be three years old bearing a white cockade in his hat and staring at all and everybody now he saw peggy and took such a liking to her that the lady his mother if so she were was forced to look at my pony and me and to tell the truth although i am not of those who adore the high folk she looked at us very kindly and with a sweetness rarely found in the women who milk the cows for us then i took off my cap to the beautiful lady without asking wherefore and she put up her hand and kissed it to me thinking perhaps that i looked like a gentle and good little boy for folk always called me innocent though god knows i never was that but now the foreign lady or lady's maid as it might be who had been busy with little dark eyes turned upon all this going on and looked me straight in the face i was about to salute her at a distance indeed and not with the nicety she had offered to me but strange to say she stared at my eyes as if she had never seen me before neither wished to see me again at this i was so startled such things beings out of my knowledge that i startled peggy also with the muscle of my legs and she being fresh from stable and the mire scraped off with cask hoop broke away so suddenly that i could do no more than turn round and lower my cap now five months old to the beautiful lady soon i overtook john fry and asked him all about them and how it was that we had missed their starting from the hostel but john would never talk much till after a gallon of cider and all that i could win out of him was that they were murdering papishers and little he cared to do with them or the devil as they came from and a good thing for me and a providence that i was gone down dulverton town to buy sweetstuff for annie else my stupid head would have gone astray with their great out coming we saw no more of them after that but turned into the sideway and soon had the fill of our hands and eyes to look to our own going for the road got worse and worse until there was none at all and perhaps the purest thing it could do was to be ashamed to show itself but we pushed on as best we might with doubt of reaching home any time except by special grace of god the fog came down upon the moors as thick as ever i saw it and there was no sound of any sort nor a breath of wind to guide us the little stubby trees that stand here and there like bushes with a wooden leg to them were drizzled with a mess of wet and hung their points with dropping wherever the butt end of a hedgerow came up from the hollow ground like the withers of a horse holes of splash were pocked and pimpled in the yellow sand of coneys or under the dwarf tree's ovens but soon it was too dark to see that or anything else i may say except the creases in the dusk where prisoned light crept up the valleys after awhile even that was gone and no other comfort left us except to see our horses heads jogging to their footsteps and the dark ground pass below us lighter where the wet was and then the splash foot after foot more clever than we can do it and the orderly jerk of the tail and the smell of what a horse is john fry was bowing forward with sleep upon his saddle and now i could no longer see the frizzle of wet upon his beard for he had a very brave one of a bright red colour and trimmed into a whale oil knot because he was newly married although that comb of hair had been a subject of some wonder to me whether i in god's good time should have the like of that handsomely set with shining beads small above and large below from the weeping of the heaven but still i could see the jog of his hat a sunday hat with a top to it and some of his shoulder bowed out in the mist so that one could say hold up john when smiler put his foot in mercy of god where be us now said john fry waking suddenly us ought to have passed hold hash jan zeen it on the road have ee no indeed john no old ash nor nothing else to my knowing nor heard nothing save thee snoring watt a vule thee must be then jan and me myzell no better harken lad harken we drew our horses up and listened through the thickness of the air and with our hands laid to our ears at first there was nothing to hear except the panting of the horses and the trickle of the eaving drops from our head covers and clothing and the soft sounds of the lonely night that make us feel and try not to think then there came a mellow noise very low and mournsome not a sound to be afraid of but to long to know the meaning with a soft rise of the hair three times it came and went again as the shaking of a thread might pass away into the distance and then i touched john fry to know that there was something near me doon't e be a vule jan vaine moozick as iver i eer god bless the man as made un doo it have they hanged one of the doones then john hush lad niver talk laike o thiccy hang a doone god knoweth the king would hang pretty quick if her did then who is it in the chains john i felt my spirit rise as i asked for now i had crossed exmoor so often as to hope that the people sometimes deserved it and think that it might be a lesson to the rogues who unjustly loved the mutton they were never born to but of course they were born to hanging when they set themselves so high it be nawbody said john vor us to make a fush about belong to t'other zide o the moor and come staling shape to our zide red jem hannaford his name thank god for him to be hanged lad and good cess to his soul for craikin zo so the sound of the quiet swinging led us very modestly as it came and went on the wind loud and low pretty regularly even as far as the foot of the gibbet where the four cross ways are vamous job this here cried john looking up to be sure of it because there were so many here be my own nick on the post red jem too and no doubt of him he do hang so handsome like and his ribs up laike a horse a'most god bless them as discoovered the way to make a rogue so useful good naight to thee jem my lad and not break thy drames with the craikin john fry shook his bridle arm and smote upon smiler merrily as he jogged into the homeward track from the guiding of the body but i was sorry for red jem and wanted to know more about him and whether he might not have avoided this miserable end and what his wife and children thought of it if indeed he had any but john would talk no more about it and perhaps he was moved with a lonesome feeling as the creaking sound came after us hould thee tongue lad he said sharply us be naigh the doone track now two maile from dunkery beacon hill the haighest place of hexmoor so happen they be abroad to naight us must crawl on our belly places boy i knew at once what he meant those bloody doones of bagworthy the awe of all devon and somerset outlaws traitors murderers my little legs began to tremble to and fro upon peggy's sides as i heard the dead robber in chains behind us and thought of the live ones still in front but john i whispered warily sidling close to his saddle bow dear john you don't think they will see us in such a fog as this never god made vog as could stop their eyesen he whispered in answer fearfully here us be by the hollow ground zober lad goo zober now if thee wish to see thy moother for i was inclined in the manner of boys to make a run of the danger and cross the doone track at full speed to rush for it and be done with it but even then i wondered why he talked of my mother so and said not a word of father we were come to a long deep goyal as they call it on exmoor a word whose fountain and origin i have nothing to do with only i know that when little boys laughed at me at tiverton for talking about a goyal a big boy clouted them on the head and said that it was in homer and meant the hollow of the hand and another time a welshman told me that it must be something like the thing they call a pant in those parts still i know what it means well enough to wit a long trough among wild hills falling towards the plain country rounded at the bottom perhaps and stiff more than steep at the sides of it whether it be straight or crooked makes no difference to it we rode very carefully down our side and through the soft grass at the bottom and all the while we listened as if the air was a speaking trumpet then gladly we breasted our nags to the rise and were coming to the comb of it when i heard something and caught john's arm and he bent his hand to the shape of his ear it was the sound of horses feet knocking up through splashy ground as if the bottom sucked them then a grunting of weary men and the lifting noise of stirrups and sometimes the clank of iron mixed with the wheezy croning of leather and the blowing of hairy nostrils god's sake jack slip round her belly and let her go where she wull as john fry whispered so i did for he was off smiler by this time but our two pads were too fagged to go far and began to nose about and crop sniffing more than they need have done i crept to john's side very softly with the bridle on my arm let goo braidle let goo lad plaise god they take them for forest ponies or they'll zend a bullet through us i saw what he meant and let go the bridle for now the mist was rolling off and we were against the sky line to the dark cavalcade below us john lay on the ground by a barrow of heather where a little gullet was and i crept to him afraid of the noise i made in dragging my legs along and the creak of my cord breeches john bleated like a sheep to cover it a sheep very cold and trembling then just as the foremost horseman passed scarce twenty yards below us a puff of wind came up the glen and the fog rolled off before it and suddenly a strong red light cast by the cloud weight downwards spread like fingers over the moorland opened the alleys of darkness and hung on the steel of the riders dunkery beacon whispered john so close into my ear that i felt his lips and teeth ashake dursn't fire it now except to show the doones way home again since the naight as they went up and throwed the watchmen atop of it why"
