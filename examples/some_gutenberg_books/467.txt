difficulties in it the viscount knowing the power the dauphin queen had over monsieur d'anville thought it not amiss to employ the interest of that princess to engage him to serve mademoiselle de chartres both with the king and the prince de montpensier whose intimate friend he was he spoke to the dauphin queen about it and she entered with joy into an affair which concerned the promotion of a lady for whom she had a great affection she expressed as much to the viscount and assured him that though she knew she should do what was disagreeable to the cardinal of loraine her uncle she would pass over that consideration with pleasure because she had reasons of complaint against him since he every day more and more espoused the interest of the queen against hers persons of gallantry are always glad of an opportunity of speaking to those who love them no sooner was the viscount gone but the queen dauphin sent chatelart to monsieur d'anville to desire him from her to be at court that evening chatelart was his favourite and acquainted with his passion for this princess and therefore received her commands with great pleasure and respect he was a gentleman of a good family in dauphiny but his wit and merit distinguished him more than his birth he was well received at court he was graceful in his person perfect at all sorts of exercises he sung agreeably he wrote verses and was of so amorous and gallant a temper as endeared him to monsieur d'anville in such a degree that he made him the confidant of his amours between the queen dauphin and him this confidence gave him access to that princess and it was owing to the frequent opportunities he had of seeing her that he commenced that unhappy passion which deprived him of his reason and at last cost him his life monsieur d'anville did not fail to be at court in the evening he thought himself very happy that the queen dauphin had made choice of him to manage an affair she had at heart and he promised to obey her commands with the greatest exactness but the duchess of valentinois being warned of the design in view had traversed it with so much care and prepossessed the king so much against it that when monsieur d'anville came to speak to his majesty about it he plainly showed he did not approve of it and commanded him to signify as much to the prince de montpensier one may easily judge what the sentiments of madam de chartres were upon the breaking off of an affair which she had set her mind so much upon and the ill success of which gave such an advantage to her enemies and was so great a prejudice to her daughter the queen dauphin declared to mademoiselle de chartres in a very friendly manner the uneasiness she was in for not having been able to serve her you see madam said she to her that my interest is small i am upon so ill terms with the queen and the duchess of valentinois that it is no wonder if they or their dependents still succeed in disappointing my desires nevertheless i have constantly used my endeavours to please them indeed they hate me not for my own sake but for my mother's she formerly gave them some jealousy and uneasiness the king was in love with her before he was in love with the duchess and in the first years of his marriage when he had no issue he appeared almost resolved to be divorced from the queen in order to make room for my mother though at the same time he had some affection for the duchess madam de valentinois being jealous of a lady whom he had formerly loved and whose wit and beauty were capable of lessening her interest joined herself to the constable who was no more desirous than herself that the king should marry a sister of the duke of guise they possessed the deceased king with their sentiments and though he mortally hated the duchess of valentinois and loved the queen he joined his endeavours with theirs to prevent the divorce but in order to take from the king all thoughts of marrying the queen my mother they struck up a marriage between her and the king of scotland who had had for his first wife the king's sister and they did this because it was the easiest to be brought to a conclusion though they failed in their engagements to the king of england who was very desirous of marrying her and that failure wanted but little of occasioning a rupture between the two crowns for henry the eighth was inconsolable when he found himself disappointed in his expectations of marrying my mother and whatever other princess of france was proposed to him he always said nothing could make him amends for her he had been deprived of it is certainly true that my mother was a perfect beauty and what is very remarkable is that being the widow of the duke of longueville three kings should court her in marriage her ill fortune gave her to the least of them and placed her in a kingdom where she meets with nothing but trouble they say i resemble her but i fear i shall resemble her only in her unhappy destiny and whatever fortune may seem to promise me at present i can never think i shall enjoy it mademoiselle de chartres answered the queen that these melancholy presages were so ill grounded that they would not disturb her long and that she ought not to doubt but her good fortune would accomplish whatever it promised no one now entertained any further thoughts of mademoiselle de chartres either fearing to incur the king's displeasure or despairing to succeed with a lady who aspired to an alliance with a prince of the blood the prince of cleves alone was not disheartened at either of these considerations the death of the duke of nevers his father which happened at that time set him at entire liberty to follow his inclination and no sooner was the time of mourning expired but he wholly applied himself to the gaining of mademoiselle de chartres it was lucky for him that he addressed her at a time when what had happened had discouraged the approaches of others what allayed his joy was his fear of not being the most agreeable to her and he would have preferred the happiness of pleasing to the certainty of marrying her without being beloved the chevalier de guise had given him some jealousy but as it was rather grounded on the merit of that prince than on any action of mademoiselle de chartres he made it his whole endeavour to discover if he was so happy as to have his addresses admitted and approved he had no opportunity of seeing her but at court or public assemblies so that it was very difficult for him to get a private conversation with her at last he found means to do it and informed her of his intention and of his love with all the respect imaginable he urged her to acquaint him what the sentiments were which she had for him assuring her that those which he had for her were of such a nature as would render him eternally miserable if she resigned herself wholly up to the will of her mother as mademoiselle de chartres had a noble and generous heart she was sincerely touched with gratitude for the prince of cleves's behaviour this gratitude gave a certain sweetness to her words and answers sufficient to furnish hopes to a man so desperately enamoured as the prince was so that he flattered himself in some measure that he should succeed in what he so much wished for she gave her mother an account of this conversation and madam de chartres told her that the prince of cleves had so many good qualities and discovered a discretion so much above his years that if her inclination led her to marry him she would consent to it with pleasure mademoiselle de chartres made answer that she observed in him the same good qualities that she should have less reluctance in marrying him than any other man but that she had no particular affection to his person the next day the prince caused his thoughts to be communicated to madam de chartres who gave her consent to what was proposed to her nor had she the least distrust but that in the prince of cleves she provided her daughter a husband capable of securing her affections the articles were concluded the king was acquainted with it and the marriage made public the prince of cleves found himself happy but yet not entirely contented he saw with a great deal of regret that the sentiments of mademoiselle de chartres did not exceed those of esteem and respect and he could not flatter himself that she concealed more obliging thoughts of him since the situation they were in permitted her to discover them without the least violence done to modesty it was not long before he expostulated with her on this subject is it possible says he that i should not be happy in marrying you and yet it is certain i am not you only show me a sort of civility which is far from giving me satisfaction you express none of those pretty inquietudes the concern and impatience which are the soul of love you are no further affected with my passion than you would be with one which flowed only from the advantage of your fortune and not from the beauty of your person it is unjust in you to complain replied the princess i don't know what you can desire of me more i think decency will not allow me to go further than i do it's true replied he you show some appearances i should be satisfied with were there anything beyond but instead of being restrained by decency it is that only which makes you act as you do i am not in your heart and inclinations and my presence neither gives you pain nor pleasure you can't doubt replied she but it is a sensible pleasure to me to see you and when i do see you i blush so often that you can't doubt but the seeing you gives me pain also your blushes madam replied he cannot deceive me they are signs of modesty but do not prove the heart to be affected and i shall conclude nothing more from hence than what i ought mademoiselle de chartres did not know what to answer these distinctions were above her comprehension the prince of cleves plainly saw she was far from having that tenderness of affection for him which was requisite to his happiness it was manifest she could not feel a passion which she did not understand the chevalier de guise returned from a journey a few days before the marriage he saw so many insuperable difficulties in his design of marrying mademoiselle de chartres that he gave over all hopes of succeeding in it and yet he was extremely afflicted to see her become the wife of another his grief however did not extinguish his passion and his love was as great as ever mademoiselle de chartres was not ignorant of it and he made her sensible at his return that she was the cause of that deep melancholy which appeared in his countenance he had so much merit and so much agreeableness that it was almost impossible to make him unhappy without pitying him nor could she forbear pitying him but her pity did not lead to love she acquainted her mother with the uneasiness which the chevalier's passion gave her madam de chartres admired the honour of her daughter and she admired it with reason for never was anyone more naturally sincere but she was surprised at the same time at the insensibility of her heart and the more so when she found that the prince of cleves had not been able to affect her any more than others for this reason she took great pains to endear her husband to her and to make her sensible how much she owed to the affection he had for her before he knew her and to the tenderness he since expressed for her by preferring her to all other matches at a time when no one else durst entertain the least thoughts of her the marriage was solemnised at the louvre and in the evening the king and the two queens with the whole court supped at madam de chartres's house where they were entertained with the utmost magnificence the chevalier de guise durst not distinguish himself by being absent from the ceremony but he was so little master of himself that it was easy to observe his concern the prince of cleves did not find that mademoiselle de chartres had changed her mind by changing her name his quality of a husband entitled him to the largest privileges but gave him no greater share in the affections of his wife hence it was that though he was her husband he did not cease to be her lover because he had always something to wish beyond what he possessed and though she lived perfectly easy with him yet he was not perfectly happy he preserved for her a passion full of violence and inquietude but without jealousy which had no share in his griefs never was husband less inclined to it and never was wife farther from giving the least occasion for it she was nevertheless constantly in view of the court she frequented the courts of the two queens and of madame all the people of gallantry saw her both there and at her brother in law the duke of never's whose house was open to the whole world but she had an air which inspired so great respect and had in it something so distant from gallantry that the mareschal de st andre a bold man and supported by the king's favour became her lover without daring to let her know it any otherwise than by his cares and assiduities a great many others were in the same condition and madam de chartres had added to her daughter's discretion so exact a conduct with regard to everything of decorum that everybody was satisfied she was not to be come at the duchess of loraine while she was employed in negotiating the peace had applied herself to settle the marriage of the duke her son a marriage was agreed upon between him and madam claude of france the king's second daughter and the month of february was appointed for the nuptials in the meantime the duke of nemours continued at brussels his thoughts being wholly employed on his design in england he was continually sending or receiving couriers from thence his hopes increased every day and at last lignerolly sent him word that it was time to finish by his presence what was so well begun he received this news with all the joy a young ambitious man is capable of who sees himself advanced to a throne merely by the force of his personal merit his mind insensibly accustomed itself to the grandeur of a royal state and whereas he had at first rejected this undertaking as an impracticable thing the difficulties of it were now worn out of his imagination and he no longer saw anything to obstruct his way he sent away in haste to paris to give the necessary orders for providing a magnificent equipage that he might make his appearance in england with a splendour suitable to the design he was to conduct and soon after he followed himself to assist at the marriage of the duke of loraine he arrived the evening before the espousals and that very evening waited on the king to give him an account of his affair and to receive his orders and advice how to govern himself in it afterwards he waited on the queens but the princess of cleves was not there so that she did not see him nor so much as know of his arrival she had heard everybody speak of this celebrated prince as of the handsomest and most agreeable man at court and the queen dauphin had described him in such a manner and spoke of him to her so often that she had raised in her a curiosity and even impatience to see him the princess employed the day of the wedding in dressing herself that she might appear with the greater advantage at the ball and royal banquet that were to be at the louvre when she came everyone admired both her beauty and her dress the ball began and while she was dancing with the duke of guise a noise was heard at the door of the hall as if way was making for some person of uncommon distinction she had finished her dance and as she was casting her eyes round to single out some other person the king desired her to take him who came in last she turned about and viewing him as he was passing over the seats to come to the place where they danced she immediately concluded he was the duke of nemours the duke's person was turned in so delicate a manner that it was impossible not to express surprise at the first sight of him particularly that evening when the care he had taken to adorn himself added much to the fine air of his carriage it was as impossible to behold the princess of cleves without equal admiration the duke de nemours was struck with such surprise at her beauty that when they approached and paid their respects to each other he could not forbear showing some tokens of his admiration when they begun to dance a soft murmur of praises ran through the whole company the king and the two queens remembering that the duke and princess had never seen one another before found something very particular in seeing them dance together without knowing each other they called them as soon as they had ended their dance without giving them time to speak to anybody and asked them if they had not a desire to know each other and if they were not at some loss about it as for me madam said the duke to the queen i am under no uncertainty in this matter but as the princess of cleves has not the same reasons to lead her to guess who i am as i have to direct me to know her i should be glad if your majesty would be pleased to let her know my name i believe said the queen dauphin that she knows your name as well as you know hers i assure you madam replied the princess a little embarrassed that i am not so good a guesser as you imagine yes you guess very well answered the queen dauphin and your unwillingness to acknowledge that you know the duke of nemours without having seen him before carries in it something very obliging to him the queen interrupted them that the ball might go on and the duke de nemours took out the queen dauphin this princess was a perfect beauty and such she appeared in the eyes of the duke de nemours before he went to flanders but all this evening he could admire nothing but madam de cleves the chevalier de guise whose idol she still was sat at her feet and what had passed filled him with the utmost grief he looked upon it as ominous for him that fortune had destined the duke of nemours to be in love with the princess of cleves and whether there appeared in reality any concern in the princess's face or whether the chevalier's jealousy only led him to suspect it he believed that she was touched with the sight of the duke and could not forbear telling her that monsieur de nemours was very happy to commence an acquaintance with her by an incident which had something very gallant and extraordinary in it madam de cleves returned home with her thoughts full of what had passed at the ball and though it was very late she went into her mother's room to give her a relation of it in doing which she praised the duke of nemours with a certain air that gave madam de chartres the same suspicion the chevalier de guise had entertained before the day following the ceremony of the duke of loraine's marriage was performed and there the princess of cleves observed so inimitable a grace and so fine a mien in the duke of nemours that she was yet more surprised she afterwards saw him at the court of the queen dauphin she saw him play at tennis with the king she saw him run the ring she heard him discourse still she found he far excelled everybody else and drew the attention of the company to him wherever he was in short the gracefulness of his person and the agreeableness of his wit soon made a considerable impression on her heart the duke de nemours had an inclination no less violent for her and hence flowed all that gaiety and sweetness of behaviour which the first desires of pleasing ordinarily inspire a man with hence he became more amiable than ever he was before so that by often seeing one another and by seeing in each other whatever was most accomplished at court it could not be but that they must mutually receive the greatest pleasure from such a commerce the duchess of valentinois made one in all parties of pleasure and the king was still as passionately fond of her as in the beginning of his love the princess of cleves being at those years wherein people think a woman is incapable of inciting love after the age of twenty five beheld with the utmost astonishment the king's passion for the duchess who was a grandmother and had lately married her granddaughter she often spoke on this subject to madam de chartres is it possible madam said she that the king should still continue to love how could he take a fancy to one who was so much older than himself who had been his father's mistress and who as i have heard is still such to many others tis certain answered madam de chartres it was neither the merit nor the fidelity of the duchess of valentinois which gave birth to the king's passion or preserved it and this is what he can't be justified in for if this lady had had beauty and youth suitable to her birth and the merit of having had no other lover if she had been exactly true and faithful to the king if she had loved him with respect only to his person without the interested views of greatness and fortune and without using her power but for honourable purposes and for his majesty's interest in this case it must be confessed one could have hardly forbore praising his passion for her if i was not afraid continued madam de chartres that you would say the same thing of me which is said of most women of my years that they love to recount the history of their own times i would inform you how the king's passion for this duchess began and of several particulars of the court of the late king which have a great relation to things that are acted at present far from blaming you replied the princess of cleves for repeating the histories of past times i lament madam that you have not instructed me in those of the present nor informed me as to the different interests and parties of the court i am so entirely ignorant of them that i thought a few days ago the constable was very well with the queen you was extremely mistaken answered madam de chartres the queen hates the constable and if ever she has power he'll be but too sensible of it she knows he has often told the king that of all his children none resembled him but his natural ones i should never have suspected this hatred said the princess of cleves after having seen her assiduity in writing to the constable during his imprisonment the joy she expressed at his return and how she always calls him compere as well as the king if you judge from appearances in a court replied madam de chartres you will often be deceived truth and appearances seldom go together but to return to the duchess of valentinois you know her name is diana de poitiers her family is very illustrious she is descended from the ancient dukes of aquitaine her grandmother was a natural daughter of lewis the xi and in short she possesses everything that is great in respect of birth st valier her father had the unhappiness to be involved in the affair of the constable of bourbon which you have heard of he was condemned to lose his head and accordingly was conducted to the scaffold his daughter viz the duchess who was extremely beautiful and who had already charmed the late king managed so well i don't know by what means that she obtained her father's life the pardon was brought him at the moment he was expecting the fatal blow but the pardon availed little for fear had seized him so deeply that it bereft him of his senses and he died a few days after his daughter appeared at court as the king's mistress but the italian expedition and the imprisonment of the present prince were interruptions to his love affair when the late king returned from spain and madam the regent went to meet him at bayonne she brought all her maids of honour with her among whom was mademoiselle de pisselen who was since duchess d'etampes the king fell in love with her though she was inferior in birth wit and beauty to the duchess of valentinois and had no advantage above her but that of being very young i have heard her say several times that she was born the same day diana de poitiers was married but she spoke this in the malice of her heart and not as what she knew to be true for i am much mistaken if the duchess of valentinois did not marry monsieur de breze at the same time that the king fell in love with madam d'etampes never was a greater hatred than that between these two ladies the duchess could not pardon madam d'etampes for having taken from her the title of the king's mistress and madam d'etampes was violently jealous of the duchess because the king still kept correspondence with her that prince was by no means constant to his mistresses there was always one among them that had the title and honours of mistress but the ladies of the small band as they were styled shared his favour by turns the loss of the dauphin his son who died at tournon and was thought to be poisoned extremely afflicted him he had not the same affection and tenderness for his second son the present king he imagined he did not see in him spirit and vivacity enough and complained of it one day to the duchess of valentinois who told him she would endeavour to raise a passion in him for her in order to make him more sprightly and agreeable she succeeded in it as you see and this passion is now of above twenty years duration without being changed either by time or incidents the late king at first opposed it and whether he had still love enough left for the duchess of valentinois to be jealous or whether he was urged on by the duchess d'etampes who was in despair upon seeing the dauphin so much attached to her enemy it is certain he beheld this passion with an indignation and resentment that showed itself every day by something or other the dauphin neither valued his anger or his hatred nor could anything oblige him either to abate or conceal his flame so that the king was forced to accustom himself to bear it with patience this opposition of his to his father's will withdrew his affections from him more and more and transferred them to his third son the duke of orleans who was a prince of a fine person full of fire and ambition and of a youthful heat which wanted to be moderated however he would have made a very great prince had he arrived to a more ripened age the rank of eldest which the dauphin held and the king's favour which the duke of orleans was possessed of created between them a sort of emulation that grew by degrees to hatred this emulation began from their infancy and was still kept up in its height when the emperor passed through france he gave the preference entirely to the duke of orleans which the dauphin resented so bitterly that while the emperor was at chantilli he endeavoured to prevail with the constable to arrest him without waiting for the king's orders but the constable refused to do it however the king afterwards blamed him for not following his son's"
