and tell all the secrets but tom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people ben rogers said he couldn't get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was dog tired chapter iii well i got a good going over in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes but the widow she didn't scold but only cleaned off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed but nothing come of it she told me to pray every day and whatever i asked for i would get it but it warn't so i tried it once i got a fish line but no hooks it warn't any good to me without hooks i tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow i couldn't make it work by and by one day i asked miss watson to try for me but she said i was a fool she never told me why and i couldn't make it out no way i set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it i says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why don't deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole why can't miss watson fat up no says i to my self there ain't nothing in it i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts this was too many for me but she told me what she meant i must help other people and do everything i could for other people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself this was including miss watson as i took it i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldn't see no advantage about it except for the other people so at last i reckoned i wouldn't worry about it any more but just let it go sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a body's mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again i judged i could see that there was two providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's providence but if miss watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more i thought it all out and reckoned i would belong to the widow's if he wanted me though i couldn't make out how he was a going to be any better off then than what he was before seeing i was so ignorant and so kind of low down and ornery pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable for me i didn't want to see him no more he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around well about this time he was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people said they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like pap but they couldn't make nothing out of the face because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all they said he was floating on his back in the water they took him and buried him on the bank but i warn't comfortable long because i happened to think of something i knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back but on his face so i knowed then that this warn't pap but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes so i was uncomfortable again i judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished he wouldn't we played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned all the boys did we hadn't robbed nobody hadn't killed any people but only just pretended we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but we never hived any of them tom sawyer called the hogs ingots and he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked but i couldn't see no profit in it one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich a rabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter mules all loaded down with di'monds and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called it and kill the lot and scoop the things he said we must slick up our swords and guns and get ready he never could go after even a turnip cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them till you rotted and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before i didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and a rabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephants so i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill but there warn't no spaniards and a rabs and there warn't no camels nor no elephants it warn't anything but a sunday school picnic and only a primer class at that we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymn book and a tract and then the teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut i didn't see no di'monds and i told tom sawyer so he said there was loads of them there anyway and he said there was a rabs there too and elephants and things i said why couldn't we see them then he said if i warn't so ignorant but had read a book called don quixote i would know without asking he said it was all done by enchantment he said there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sunday school just out of spite i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians tom sawyer said i was a numskull why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well i says s'pose we got some genies to help _us_ can't we lick the other crowd then how you going to get them i don't know how do _they_ get them why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come tearing in with the thunder and lightning a ripping around and the smoke a rolling and everything they're told to do they up and do it they don't think nothing of pulling a shot tower up by the roots and belting a sunday school superintendent over the head with it or any other man who makes them tear around so why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring and they've got to do whatever he says if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds and fill it full of chewing gum or whatever you want and fetch an emperor's daughter from china for you to marry they've got to do it and they've got to do it before sun up next morning too and more they've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand well says i i think they are a pack of flat heads for not keeping the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that and what's more if i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp how you talk huck finn why you'd _have_ to come when he rubbed it whether you wanted to or not what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church all right then i _would_ come but i lay i'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country shucks it ain't no use to talk to you huck finn you don't seem to know anything somehow perfect saphead i thought all this over for two or three days and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warn't no use none of the genies come so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of tom sawyer's lies i reckoned he believed in the a rabs and the elephants but as for me i think different it had all the marks of a sunday school chapter iv well three or four months run along and it was well into the winter now i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty five and i don't reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever i don't take no stock in mathematics anyway at first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand it whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be i was getting sort of used to the widow's ways too and they warn't so raspy on me living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to me i liked the old ways best but i was getting so i liked the new ones too a little bit the widow said i was coming along slow but sure and doing very satisfactory she said she warn't ashamed of me one morning i happened to turn over the salt cellar at breakfast i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of me and crossed me off she says take your hands away huckleberry what a mess you are always making the widow put in a good word for me but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough i started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasn't one of them kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked along low spirited and on the watch out i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence there was an inch of new snow on the ground and i seen somebody's tracks they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden fence it was funny they hadn't come in after standing around so i couldn't make it out it was very curious somehow i was going to follow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first i didn't notice anything at first but next i did there was a cross in the left boot heel made with big nails to keep off the devil i was up in a second and shinning down the hill i looked over my shoulder every now and then but i didn't see nobody i was at judge thatcher's as quick as i could get there he said why my boy you are all out of breath did you come for your interest no sir i says is there some for me oh yes a half yearly is in last night over a hundred and fifty dollars quite a fortune for you you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand because if you take it you'll spend it no sir i says i don't want to spend it i don't want it at all nor the six thousand nuther i want you to take it i want to give it to you the six thousand and all he looked surprised he couldn't seem to make it out he says why what can you mean my boy i says don't you ask me no questions about it please you'll take it won't you he says well i'm puzzled is something the matter please take it says i and don't ask me nothing then i won't have to tell no lies he studied a while and then he says oho o i think i see you want to _sell_ all your property to me not give it that's the correct idea then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says there you see it says for a consideration that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it here's a dollar for you now you sign it so i signed it and left miss watson's nigger jim had a hair ball as big as your fist which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic with it he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed everything so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again for i found his tracks in the snow what i wanted to know was what he was going to do and was he going to stay jim got out his hair ball and said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch jim tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened but it warn't no use he said it wouldn't talk he said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little and it wouldn't pass nohow even if the brass didn't show because it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time i reckoned i wouldn't say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge i said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hair ball would take it because maybe it wouldn't know the difference jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hair ball would think it was good he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you couldn't see no brass and it wouldn't feel greasy no more and so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hair ball well i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot it jim put the quarter under the hair ball and got down and listened again this time he said the hair ball was all right he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to i says go on so the hair ball talked to jim and jim told it to me he says yo ole father doan know yit what he's a gwyne to do sometimes he spec he'll go way en den agin he spec he'll stay de bes way is to res easy en let de ole man take his own way dey's two angels hoverin roun bout him one uv em is white en shiny en t'other one is black de

it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung when i lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self chapter v i had shut the door to then i turned around and there he was i used to be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much i reckoned i was scared now too but in a minute i see i was mistaken that is after the first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so unexpected but right away after i see i warn't scared of him worth bothring about he was most fifty and he looked it his hair was long and tangled and greasy and hung down and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines it was all black no gray so was his long mixed up whiskers there warn't no color in his face where his face showed it was white not like another man's white but a white to make a body sick a white to make a body's flesh crawl a tree toad white a fish belly white as for his clothes just rags that was all he had one ankle resting on t'other knee the boot on that foot was busted and two of his toes stuck through and he worked them now and then his hat was laying on the floor an old black slouch with the top caved in like a lid i stood a looking at him he set there a looking at me with his chair tilted back a little i set the candle down i noticed the window was up so he had clumb in by the shed he kept a looking me all over by and by he says starchy clothes very you think you're a good deal of a big bug _don't_ you maybe i am maybe i ain't i says don't you give me none o your lip says he you've put on considerable many frills since i been away i'll take you down a peg before i get done with you you're educated too they say can read and write you think you're better'n your father now don't you because he can't _i'll_ take it out of you who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness hey who told you you could the widow she told me the widow hey and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain't none of her business nobody never told her well i'll learn her how to meddle and looky here you drop that school you hear i'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what _he_ is you lemme catch you fooling around that school again you hear your mother couldn't read and she couldn't write nuther before she died none of the family couldn't before _they_ died i can't and here you're a swelling yourself up like this i ain't the man to stand it you hear say lemme hear you read i took up a book and begun something about general washington and the wars when i'd read about a half a minute he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house he says it's so you can do it i had my doubts when you told me now looky here you stop that putting on frills i won't have it i'll lay for you my smarty and if i catch you about that school i'll tan you good first you know you'll get religion too i never see such a son he took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy and says what's this it's something they give me for learning my lessons good he tore it up and says i'll give you something better i'll give you a cowhide he set there a mumbling and a growling a minute and then he says _ain't_ you a sweet scented dandy though a bed and bedclothes and a look'n glass and a piece of carpet on the floor and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard i never see such a son i bet i'll take some o these frills out o you before i'm done with you why there ain't no end to your airs they say you're rich hey how's that they lie that's how looky here mind how you talk to me i'm a standing about all i can stand now so don't gimme no sass i've been in town two days and i hain't heard nothing but about you bein rich i heard about it away down the river too that's why i come you git me that money to morrow i want it i hain't got no money it's a lie judge thatcher's got it you git it i want it i hain't got no money i tell you you ask judge thatcher he'll tell you the same all right i'll ask him and i'll make him pungle too or i'll know the reason why say how much you got in your pocket i want it i hain't got only a dollar and i want that to it don't make no difference what you want it for you just shell it out he took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky said he hadn't had a drink all day when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when i reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told me to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i didn't drop that next day he was drunk and he went to judge thatcher's and bullyragged him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldn't and then he swore he'd make the law force him the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had just come and he didn't know the old man so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it said he'd druther not take a child away from its father so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business that pleased the old man till he couldn't rest he said he'd cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didn't raise some money for him i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher and pap took it and got drunk and went a blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed him again for a week but he said _he_ was satisfied said he was boss of his son and he'd make it warm for _him_ when he got out the new judge said he was a going to make a man of him so he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just old pie to him so to speak and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried and said he'd been a fool and fooled away his life but now he was a going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him the judge said he could hug him for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said he believed it the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says look at it gentlemen and ladies all take a hold of it shake it there's a hand that was the hand of a hog but it ain't so no more it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life and'll die before he'll go back you mark them words don't forget i said them it's a clean hand now shake it don't be afeard so they shook it one after the other all around and cried the judge's wife she kissed it then the old man he signed a pledge made his mark the judge said it was the holiest time on record or something like that then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty rod and clumb back again and had a good old time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun up and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it the judge he felt kind of sore he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didn't know no other way chapter vi well pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he went for me too for not stopping school he catched"
