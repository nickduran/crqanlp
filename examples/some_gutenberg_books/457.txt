"1" "of themselves and of women who are securely well taken care of to scorn the woman or the helpless bred man who marries for money or even entertains that idea how little imagination these scorners have to marry for a mere living hardly better than one could make for oneself assuredly does show a pitiful lack of self reliance a melancholy lack of self respect but for men or women all their lives used to luxury and with no ability whatever at earning money for such persons to marry money in order to save themselves from the misery and shame that poverty means to them is the most natural the most human action conceivable the man or the woman who says he or she would not do it either is a hypocrite or is talking without thinking you may in honesty criticize and condemn a social system that suffers men and women to be so crudely and criminally miseducated by being given luxury they did not earn but to condemn the victims of that system for acting as its logic compels is sheer folly or sheer phariseeism would mildred gower have married for money as the weeks fled as the bank account dwindled she would have grasped eagerly at any rich man who might have offered himself no matter how repellent he might have been she did not want a bare living she did not want what passes with the mass of middle class people for comfort she wanted what she had the beautiful and spacious house the costly and fashionable clothing the servants the carriages and motors the thousand and one comforts luxuries and vanities to which she had always been used in the brain of a young woman of poor or only comfortably off family the thoughts that seethed in mildred gower's brain would have been so many indications of depravity in mildred gower's brain they were the natural the inevitable thoughts they indicated everything as to her training nothing as to her character so when she thinking only of a rich marriage with no matter whom and contrasting herself with the fine women portrayed in the novels and plays condemned herself as shameless and degraded she did herself grave injustice but no rich man whether attractive or repulsive offered indeed no man of any kind offered instead it was her mother who married a widower named james presbury elderly with an income of five to six thousand a year from inherited wealth stumbled into hanging rock to live was impressed by the style the widow gower maintained believed the rumor that her husband had left her better off than was generally thought proposed and was accepted and two years and a month after henry gower's death his widow became mrs james presbury and ceased to veil from her new husband the truth as to her affairs mildred had thought that than the family quarrels incident to settling her father's estate human nature could no lower descend she was now to be disillusioned when a young man or a young woman blunders into a poor marriage in trying to make a rich one he or she is usually withheld from immediate and frank expression by the timidity of youth not so the elderly man or woman as we grow older no matter how timidly conventional we are by nature we become through selfishness or through indifference to the opinion of others or through impatience of petty restraint more and more outspoken old presbury discovered how he had tricked himself four days after the wedding he and his bride were at the waldorf in new york a honeymooning the bride had never professed to be rich she had simply continued in her lifelong way had simply acted rich she well knew the gaudy delusions her admirer was entertaining and she saw to it that nothing was said or done to disturb him she inquired into his affairs made sure of the substantiality of the comparatively small income he possessed decided to accept him as her best available chance to escape becoming a charge upon her anything but eager and generous relatives she awaited the explosion with serenity she cared not a flip for presbury who was a soft and silly old fool full of antiquated compliments and so drearily the inferior of henry gower physically and mentally that even she could appreciate the difference the descent she rather enjoyed the prospect of a combat with him of the end of dissimulating her contempt she had thought out and had put in arsenal ready for use a variety of sneers jeers and insults that suggested themselves to her as she listened and simpered and responded while he was courting had the opportunity offered earlier than the fourth day she would have seized it but not until that fourth morning was she in just the right mood she had eaten too much dinner the night before and had followed it after two hours in a stuffy theater with an indigestible supper he liked the bedroom windows open at night she liked them closed after she fell into a heavy sleep he slipped out of bed and opened the windows wide to teach her by the night's happy experience that she was entirely mistaken as to the harmfulness of fresh winter air the result was that she awakened with a frightful cold and a splitting headache and as the weather was about to change she had shooting pains like toothache through her toes the instant she thrust them into her shoes the elderly groom believing he had a rich bride was all solicitude and infuriating attention she waited until he had wrought her to the proper pitch of fury then she said in reply to some remark of his yes i shall rely upon you entirely i want you to take absolute charge of my affairs the tears sprang to his eyes his weak old mouth rapidly falling to pieces twisted and twitched with emotion i'll try to deserve your confidence darling said he i've had large business experience in the way of investing carefully i mean i don't think your affairs will suffer in my hands oh i'm sure they'll not trouble you said she in a sweet sure tone as the pains shot through her feet and her head you'll hardly notice my little mite in your property she pretended to reflect let me see there's seven thousand left but of course half of that is millie's it must be very well invested said he those seven thousand shares must be of the very best shares said she with a gentle little laugh i mean dollars presbury was about to lift a cup of cafe au lait to his lips instead he turned it over into the platter of eggs and bacon we mildred and i pursued his bride were left with only forty odd thousand between us of course we had to live so naturally there's very little left presbury was shaking so violently that his head and arms waggled like a jumping jack's he wrapped his elegant white fingers about the arms of his chair to steady himself in a suffocated voice he said do you mean to say that you have only seven thousand dollars in the world only half that corrected she oh dear how my head aches less than half that for there are some debts she was impatient for the explosion the agony of her feet and head needed outlet and relief but he disappointed her that was one of the situations in which one appeals in vain to the resources of language he shrank and sank back in his chair his jaw dropped and he vented a strange imbecile cackling laugh it was not an expression of philosophic mirth of sense of the grotesqueness of an anti climax it was not an expression of any emotion whatever it was simply a signal from a mind temporarily dethroned what are you laughing at she said sharply his answer was a repetition of the idiotic sound what's the matter with you demanded she please close your mouth it was a timely piece of advice for his upper and false teeth had become partially dislodged and threatened to drop upon the shirt bosom gayly showing between the lapels of his dark blue silk house coat he slowly closed his mouth moving his teeth back into place with his tongue a gesture that made her face twitch with rage and disgust seven thousand dollars he mumbled dazedly i said less than half that retorted she sharply and i thought you were rich a peculiar rolling of the eyes and twisting of the lips gave her the idea that he was about to vent that repulsive sound again don't you laugh she cried i can't bear your laugh even at its best suddenly he galvanized into fury this is an outrage he cried waving his useless looking white fists you have swindled me swindled me her head stopped aching the pains in her feet either ceased or she forgot them in a suspiciously calm voice she said what do you mean i mean that you are a swindler he shouted banging one fist on the table and waving the other she acted as though his meaning were just dawning upon her do you mean said she tranquilly that you married me for money i mean that i thought you a substantial woman and that i find you are an adventuress did you think inquired she that any woman who had money would marry you she laughed very quietly you are a fool he sat back to look at her this mode of combat in such circumstances puzzled him i knew that you were rich she went on or you would not have dared offer yourself to me all my friends were amazed at my stooping to accept you your father was an irish tammany contractor wasn't he a sort of criminal but i simply had to marry so i gave you my family and position and name in exchange for your wealth a good bargain for you but a poor one for me these references to his wealth were most disconcerting especially as they were accompanied by remarks about his origin of which he was so ashamed that he had changed the spelling of his name in the effort to clear himself of it however some retort was imperative he looked at her and said swindler and adventuress don't repeat that lie said she you are the adventurer despite the fact that you are very rich don't say that again cried he i never said or pretended i was rich i have about five thousand a year and you'll not get a cent of it madam she knew his income but no one would have suspected it from her expression of horror what she gasped you dared to marry me when you were a beggar me the widow of henry gower you impudent old wreck why you haven't enough to pay my servants what are we to live on pray i don't know what you'll live on replied he _i_ shall live as i always have a beggar she exclaimed i married to a beggar she burst into tears how men take advantage of a woman alone if my son had been near me but there's surely some law to protect me yes i'm sure there is oh i'll punish you for having deceived me her eyes dried as she looked at him how dare you sit there how dare you face me you miserable fraud early in her acquaintance with him she had discovered that determining factors in his character were sensitiveness about his origin and sensitiveness about his social position on this knowledge of his weaknesses was securely based her confidence that she could act as she pleased toward him to ease her pains she proceeded to pour out her private opinion of him all the disagreeable things all the insults she had been storing up she watched him as only a woman can watch a man she saw that his rage was not dangerous that she was forcing him into a position where fear of her revenging herself by disgracing him would overcome anger at the collapse of his fatuous dreams of wealth she did not despise him the more deeply for sitting there for not flying from the room or trying to kill her or somehow compelling her to check that flow of insult she already despised him utterly also she attached small importance to self respect having no knowledge of what that quality really is when she grew tired she became quiet they sat there a long time in silence at last he ran up the white flag of abject surrender by saying what'll we live on that's what i'd like to know an eavesdropper upon the preceding violence of upward of an hour would have assumed that at its end this pair must separate never to see each other again voluntarily but that idea even as a possibility had not entered the mind of either they had lived a long time they were practical people they knew from the outset that somehow they must arrange to go on together the alternative meant a mere pittance of alimony for her meant for him social ostracism and the small income cut in half meant for both scandal and confusion said she fretfully oh i suppose we'll get along somehow i don't know anything about those things i've always been looked after kept from contact with the sordid side of life that house you live in he went on does it belong to you she gave him a contemptuous glance of course said she what low people you must have been used to i thought perhaps you had rented it for your bunco game retorted he the furniture the horses the motor all those things do they belong to you i shall leave the room if you insult me said she did you include them in the seven thousand dollars the money is in the bank it has nothing to do with our house and our property he reflected presently said the horses and carriages must be sold at once and all those servants dismissed except perhaps two we can live in the house she grew purple with rage sell my carriages discharge my servants i'd like to see you try who's to pay for keeping up that establishment demanded he she was silent she saw what he had in mind if you want to keep that house and live comfortably he went on you've got to cut expenses to the bone you see that don't you i can't live any way but the way i've been used to all my life wailed she he eyed her disgustedly was there anything equal to a woman for folly we've got to make the most of what little we have said he i tell you i don't know anything about those things repeated she you'll have to look after them mildred and i aren't like the women you've been used to we are ladies presbury's rage boiled over again at the mention of mildred that daughter of yours he cried what's to be done about her i've got no money to waste on her you miserable tammany thing exclaimed she don't you dare speak of my daughter except in the most respectful way and once more she opened out upon him wreaking upon him all her wrath against fate all the pent up fury of two years fury which had been denied such fury's usual and natural expression in denunciations of the dead bread winner the generous and ever kind henry gower could not be to blame for her wretched plight and of course she herself could not be to blame for it so until now there had been no scapegoat presbury therefore received the whole burden he alarmed lest a creature apparently so irrational should in wild rage drive him away ruin him socially perhaps induce a sympathetic court to award her a large part of his income as alimony said not a word in reply he bade his wrath wait later on when the peril was over when he had a firm grip upon the situation then he would take his revenge they gave up the expensive suite at the waldorf that very day and returned to hanging rock they alternated between silence and the coarsest crudest quarrelings for neither had the intelligence to quarrel wittily or the refinement to quarrel artistically as soon as they arrived at the gower house mildred was dragged into the wrangle i married this terrible man for your sake was the burden of her mother's wail and he is a beggar wants to sell off everything and dismiss the servants you are a pair of paupers cried the old man you are shameless tricksters be careful how you goad me mildred had anticipated an unhappy ending to her mother's marriage but she had not knowledge enough of life or of human nature to anticipate any such horrors as now began every day all day long the vulgar fight raged her mother and her stepfather withdrew from each other's presence only to think up fresh insults to fling at each other as soon as they were armed they hastened to give battle again she avoided presbury her mother she could not avoid and when her mother was not in combat with him she was weeping or wailing or railing to mildred it was at mildred's urging that her mother acquiesced in presbury's plans for reducing expenses within income at first the girl even more ignorant than her mother of practical affairs did not appreciate the wisdom not to say the necessity of what he wished to do but soon she saw that he was right that the servants must go that the horses and carriages and the motors must be sold when she was convinced and had convinced her mother she still did not realize what the thing really meant not until she no longer had a maid did she comprehend to a woman who has never had a maid or who has taken on a maid as a luxury it will seem an exaggeration to say that mildred felt as helpless as a baby lying alone in a crib before it has learned to crawl yet that is rather an understatement of her plight the maid left in the afternoon mildred not without inconveniences that had in the novelty their amusing side contrived to dress that evening for dinner and to get to bed but when she awakened in the morning and was ready to dress the loss of therese became a tragedy it took the girl nearly four hours to get herself together presentably and then never had she looked so unkempt with her hair thick and soft she could do nothing what a wonderful person therese was thought she and i always regarded her as rather stupid her mother who had not had a maid until she was about thirty and had never become completely dependent fared somewhat better though hearing her moans you would have thought she was faring worse mildred's unhappiness increased from day to day as her wardrobe fell into confusion and disrepair she felt that she must rise to the situation must teach herself must save herself from impending dowdiness and slovenliness but her brain seemed to be paralyzed she did not know how or where to begin to learn she often in secret gave way to the futility of tears there were now only a cook and one housemaid and a man of all work all three newcomers for presbury insisted most wisely that none of the servants of the luxurious wasteful days would be useful in the new circumstances he was one of those small orderly men who have a genius for just such situations as the one he now proceeded to grapple with and solve in his pleasure at managing everything about that house in distributing the work among the three servants in marketing and in inspecting purchases and nosing into the garbage barrel in looking for dust on picture frames and table tops and for neglected weeds in the garden walks in this multitude of engrossing delights he forgot his anger over the trick that had been played upon him he still fought with his wife and denounced her and met insult with insult but that too was one of his pleasures also he felt that on the whole he had done well in marrying he had been lonely as a bachelor had had no one to talk with or to quarrel with nothing to do the marriage was not so expensive as his wife had brought him a house and it such a one as he had always regarded as the apogee of elegance living was not dear in hanging rock if one understood managing and gave time to it and socially he was at last established soon his wife was about as contented as she had ever been in her life she hated and despised her husband but quarreling with him and railing against him gave her occupation and aim two valuable assets toward happiness that she had theretofore lacked her living shelter food clothing enough was now secure but the most important factor of all in her content was the one apparently too trivial to be worthy of record from girlhood she could not recall a single day in which she had not suffered from her feet and she had been ashamed to say anything about it had never let anyone even her maid see her feet which were about the only unsightly part of her none had guessed the cause of her chronic ill temper until presbury that genius for the little said within a week of their marriage you talk and act like a woman with chronic corns he did not dream of the effect this chance thrust had upon his wife for the first time he had really landed she concealed her fright and her shame as best she could and went on quarreling more viciously than ever but he presently returned to the attack said he your feet hurt you i'm sure they do now that i think of it you walk that way i suppose i deserve my fate said she when a woman marries beneath her she must expect insult and low conversation you must cure your feet said he i'll not live in the house with a person who is made fiendish by corns i think it's only corns i see no signs of bunions you brute cried his wife rushing from the room but when they met again he at once resumed the subject telling her just how she could cure herself and he kept on telling her she apparently ignoring but secretly acting on his advice he knew what he was about and her feet grew better grew well and she was happier than she had been since girlhood when she began ruining her feet with tight shoes six months after the marriage presbury and his wife were getting on about as comfortably as it is given to average humanity to get on in this world of incessant struggle between uncomfortable man and his uncomfortable environment but mildred had become more and more unhappy her mother sometimes angrily again reproachfully and that was far harder to bear blamed her for my miserable marriage to this low quarrelsome brute presbury let no day pass without telling her openly that she was a beggar living off him that she would better marry soon or he would take drastic steps to release himself of the burden when he attacked her before her mother there was a violent quarrel from which mildred fled to hide in her room or in the remotest part of the garden when he hunted her out to insult her alone she sat or stood with eyes down and face ghastly pale mute quivering she did not interrupt did not try to escape she was like the chained and spiritless dog that crouches and takes the shower of blows from its cruel master where could she go nowhere what could she do nothing in the days of prosperity she had regarded herself as proud and high spirited she now wondered at herself what had become of the pride what of the spirit she avoided looking at her image in the glass that thin pallid face those circled eyes the drawn sick expression about the mouth and nose i'm stunned she said to herself i've been stunned ever since father's death i've never recovered nor has mother and she gave way to tears for her father she fancied in fact from shame at her weakness and helplessness she thought hoped that she would not be thus feeble and cowardly if she were not living at home in the house she loved the house where she had spent her whole life and such a house comfort and luxury and taste every room every corner of the grounds full of the tenderest and most beautiful associations also there was her position in hanging rock everywhere else she would be a stranger and would have either no position at all or one worse than that of the utter outsider there she was of the few looked up to by the whole community no one knew or even suspected how she was degraded by her step father before the world he was courteous and considerate toward her as toward everybody indeed presbury's natural instincts were gentle and kindly his hatred of mildred and his passion for humiliating her were the result of his conviction that he had been tricked into the marriage and his inability to gratify his resentment upon his wife he could not make the mother suffer but he could make the daughter suffer and he did besides she was of no use to him and would presently be an expense your money will soon be gone he said to her if you paid your just share of the expenses it would be gone now when it is gone what will you do she was silent your mother has written to your brother about you mildred lifted her head a gleam of her former spirit in her eyes then she remembered and bent her gaze upon the ground but he like the cur that he is answered through a secretary that he wished to have nothing to do with either of you mildred guessed that frank had made the marriage an excuse surely some of your relatives will do something for you i have my hands full supporting your mother i don't propose to have two strapping worthless women hanging from my neck she bent her head lower and remained silent i warn you to bestir yourself he went on i give you four months after the first of the year you can't stay here unless you pay your share your third no answer you hear what i say miss he demanded yes replied she if you had any sense you wouldn't wait until your last cent was gone you'd go to new york now and get something to do what she asked all she could trust herself to speak how should _i_ know retorted he furiously you are a stranger to me you've been educated i assume surely there's something you can do you've been out six years now and have had no success for you're neither married nor engaged you can't call it success to be flattered and sought by people who wanted invitations to this house when it was a social center he paused for response from her none came you admit you are a failure he said sharply yes said she you must have realized it several years ago he went on instead of allowing your mother to keep on wasting money in entertaining lavishly here to give you a chance to marry you should have been preparing yourself to earn a living a pause isn't that true miss he had a way of pronouncing the word miss that made it an epithet a sneer at her unmarried and unmarriageable state she colored paled murmured yes then better late than never you'll do well to follow my advice and go to new york and look about you i'll i'll think of it stammered she and she did think of it but in all her life she had never considered the idea of money making that was something for men and for the middle and lower classes while hanging rock was regarded as most noisomely middle class by fashionable people it did not so regard itself money making was not for ladies like all her class she was a constant and a severe critic of the women of the lower orders who worked for her as milliners dressmakers shop attendants cooks maids but as she now realized it is one thing to pass upon the work of others it is another thing to do work oneself she there was literally nothing that she could do any occupation even the most menial was either beyond her skill or beyond her strength or beyond both suddenly she recalled that she could sing her prostrate spirit suddenly leaped erect yes she could sing her voice had been praised by experts her singing had been in demand at charity entertainments where amateurs had to compete with professionals then down she dropped again she sang well enough to know how badly she sang the long and toilsome and expensive training that lay between her and operatic or concert or even music hall stage"
