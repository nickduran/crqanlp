take the first opportunity of running up alone and asking whether she might bring her nurse she believed the fact that she could not otherwise convince her she was telling the truth would have much weight with her grandmother the princess and her nurse were the best of friends all dressing time and the princess in consequence ate an enormous little breakfast i wonder lootie that was her pet name for her nurse what pigeons eggs taste like she said as she was eating her egg not quite a common one for they always picked out the pinky ones for her we'll get you a pigeon's egg and you shall judge for yourself said the nurse oh no no returned irene suddenly reflecting they might disturb the old lady in getting it and that even if they did not she would have one less in consequence what a strange creature you are said the nurse first to want a thing and then to refuse it but she did not say it crossly and the princess never minded any remarks that were not unfriendly well you see lootie there are reasons she returned and said no more for she did not want to bring up the subject of their former strife lest her nurse should offer to go before she had had her grandmother's permission to bring her of course she could refuse to take her but then she would believe her less than ever now the nurse as she said herself afterwards could not be every moment in the room and as never before yesterday had the princess given her the smallest reason for anxiety it had not yet come into her head to watch her more closely so she soon gave her a chance and the very first that offered irene was off and up the stairs again this day's adventure however did not turn out like yesterday's although it began like it and indeed to day is very seldom like yesterday if people would note the differences even when it rains the princess ran through passage after passage and could not find the stair of the tower my own suspicion is that she had not gone up high enough and was searching on the second instead of the third floor when she turned to go back she failed equally in her search after the stair she was lost once more something made it even worse to bear this time and it was no wonder that she cried again suddenly it occurred to her that it was after having cried before that she had found her grandmother's stair she got up at once wiped her eyes and started upon a fresh quest this time although she did not find what she hoped she found what was next best she did not come on a stair that went up but she came upon one that went down it was evidently not the stair she had come up yet it was a good deal better than none so down she went and was singing merrily before she reached the bottom there to her surprise she found herself in the kitchen although she was not allowed to go there alone her nurse had often taken her and she was a great favourite with the servants so there was a general rush at her the moment she appeared for every one wanted to have her and the report of where she was soon reached the nurse's ears she came at once to fetch her but she never suspected how she had got there and the princess kept her own counsel her failure to find the old lady not only disappointed her but made her very thoughtful sometimes she came almost to the nurse's opinion that she had dreamed all about her but that fancy never lasted very long she wondered much whether she should ever see her again and thought it very sad not to have been able to find her when she particularly wanted her she resolved to say nothing more to her nurse on the subject seeing it was so little in her power to prove her words chapter 6 the little miner the next day the great cloud still hung over the mountain and the rain poured like water from a full sponge the princess was very fond of being out of doors and she nearly cried when she saw that the weather was no better but the mist was not of such a dark dingy grey there was light in it and as the hours went on it grew brighter and brighter until it was almost too brilliant to look at and late in the afternoon the sun broke out so gloriously that irene clapped her hands crying see see lootie the sun has had his face washed look how bright he is do get my hat and let us go out for a walk oh dear oh dear how happy i am lootie was very glad to please the princess she got her hat and cloak and they set out together for a walk up the mountain for the road was so hard and steep that the water could not rest upon it and it was always dry enough for walking a few minutes after the rain ceased the clouds were rolling away in broken pieces like great overwoolly sheep whose wool the sun had bleached till it was almost too white for the eyes to bear between them the sky shone with a deeper and purer blue because of the rain the trees on the roadside were hung all over with drops which sparkled in the sun like jewels the only things that were no brighter for the rain were the brooks that ran down the mountain they had changed from the clearness of crystal to a muddy brown but what they lost in colour they gained in sound or at least in noise for a brook when it is swollen is not so musical as before but irene was in raptures with the great brown streams tumbling down everywhere and lootie shared in her delight for she too had been confined to the house for three days at length she observed that the sun was getting low and said it was time to be going back she made the remark again and again but every time the princess begged her to go on just a little farther and a little farther reminding her that it was much easier to go downhill and saying that when they did turn they would be at home in a moment so on and on they did go now to look at a group of ferns over whose tops a stream was pouring in a watery arch now to pick a shining stone from a rock by the wayside now to watch the flight of some bird suddenly the shadow of a great mountain peak came up from behind and shot in front of them when the nurse saw it she started and shook and catching hold of the princess's hand turned and began to run down the hill what's all the haste nursie asked irene running alongside of her we must not be out a moment longer but we can't help being out a good many moments longer it was too true the nurse almost cried they were much too far from home it was against express orders to be out with the princess one moment after the sun was down and they were nearly a mile up the mountain if his majesty irene's papa were to hear of it lootie would certainly be dismissed and to leave the princess would break her heart it was no wonder she ran but irene was not in the least frightened not knowing anything to be frightened at she kept on chattering as well as she could but it was not easy lootie lootie why do you run so fast it shakes my teeth when i talk then don't talk said lootie but the princess went on talking she was always saying look look lootie but lootie paid no more heed to anything she said only ran on look look lootie don't you see that funny man peeping over the rock lootie only ran the faster they had to pass the rock and when they came nearer the princess saw it was only a lump of the rock itself that she had taken for a man look look lootie there's such a curious creature at the foot of that old tree look at it lootie it's making faces at us i do think lootie gave a stifled cry and ran faster still so fast that irene's little legs could not keep up with her and she fell with a crash it was a hard downhill road and she had been running very fast so it was no wonder she began to cry this put the nurse nearly beside herself but all she could do was to run on the moment she got the princess on her feet again who's that laughing at me said the princess trying to keep in her sobs and running too fast for her grazed knees nobody child said the nurse almost angrily but that instant there came a burst of coarse tittering from somewhere near and a hoarse indistinct voice that seemed to say lies lies lies oh cried the nurse with a sigh that was almost a scream and ran on faster than ever nursie lootie i can't run any more do let us walk a bit what am i to do said the nurse here i will carry you she caught her up but found her much too heavy to run with and had to set her down again then she looked wildly about her gave a great cry and said we've taken the wrong turning somewhere and i don't know where we are we are lost lost the terror she was in had quite bewildered her it was true enough they had lost the way they had been running down into a little valley in which there was no house to be seen now irene did not know what good reason there was for her nurse's terror for the servants had all strict orders never to mention the goblins to her but it was very discomposing to see her nurse in such a fright before however she had time to grow thoroughly alarmed like her she heard the sound of whistling and that revived her presently she saw a boy coming up the road from the valley to meet them he was the whistler but before they met his whistling changed to singing and this is something like what he sang ring dod bang go the hammers clang hit and turn and bore whizz and puff and roar thus we rive the rocks force the goblin locks see the shining ore one two three bright as gold can be four five six shovels mattocks picks seven eight nine light your lamp at mine ten eleven twelve loosely hold the helve we're the merry miner boys make the goblins hold their noise i wish you would hold your noise said the nurse rudely for the very word goblin at such a time and in such a place made her tremble it would bring the goblins upon them to a certainty she thought to defy them in that way but whether the boy heard her or not he did not stop his singing thirteen fourteen fifteen this is worth the siftin sixteen seventeen eighteen there's the match and lay't in nineteen twenty goblins in a plenty do be quiet cried the nurse in a whispered shriek but the boy who was now close at hand still went on hush scush scurry there you go in a hurry gobble gobble goblin there you go a wobblin hobble hobble hobblin cobble cobble cobblin hob bob goblin huuuuuh there said the boy as he stood still opposite them there that'll do for them they can't bear singing and they can't stand that song they can't sing themselves for they have no more voice than a crow and they don't like other people to sing the boy was dressed in a miner's dress with a curious cap on his head he was a very nice looking boy with eyes as dark as the mines in which he worked and as sparkling as the crystals in their rocks he was about twelve years old his face was almost too pale for beauty which came of his being so little in the open air and the sunlight for even vegetables grown in the dark are white but he looked happy merry indeed perhaps at the thought of having routed the goblins and his bearing as he stood before them had nothing clownish or rude about it i saw them he went on as i came up and i'm very glad i did i knew they were after somebody but i couldn't see who it was they won't touch you so long as i'm with you why who are you asked the nurse offended at the freedom with which he spoke to them i'm peter's son who's peter peter the miner i don't know him i'm his son though and why should the goblins mind you pray because i don't mind them i'm used to them what difference does that make if you're not afraid of them they're afraid of you i'm not afraid of them that's all but it's all that's wanted up here that is it's a different thing down there they won't always mind that song even down there and if anyone sings it they stand grinning at him awfully and if he gets frightened and misses a word or says a wrong one they oh don't they give it him what do they do to him asked irene with a trembling voice don't go frightening the princess said the nurse the princess repeated the little miner taking off his curious cap i beg your pardon but you oughtn't to be out so late everybody knows that's against the law yes indeed it is said the nurse beginning to cry again and i shall have to suffer for it what does that matter said the boy it must be your fault it is the princess who will suffer for it i hope they didn't hear you call her the princess if they did they're sure to know her again they're awfully sharp lootie lootie cried the princess take me home don't go on like that said the nurse to the boy almost fiercely how could i help it i lost my way you shouldn't have been out so late you wouldn't have lost your way if you hadn't been frightened said the boy come along i'll soon set you right again shall i carry your little highness impertinence murmured the nurse but she did not say it aloud for she thought if she made him angry he might take his revenge by telling someone belonging to the house and then it would be sure to come to the king's ears no thank you said irene i can walk very well though i can't run so fast as nursie if you will give me one hand lootie will give me another and then i shall get on famously they soon had her between them holding a hand of each now let's run said the nurse no no said the little miner that's the worst thing you can do if you hadn't run before you would not have lost your way and if you run now they will be after you in a moment i don't want to run said irene you don't think of me said the nurse yes i do lootie the boy says they won't touch us if we don't run yes but if they know at the house that i've kept you out so late i shall be turned away and that would break my heart turned away lootie who would turn you away your papa child but i'll tell him it was all my fault and you know it was lootie he won't mind that i'm sure he won't then i'll cry and go down on my knees to him and beg him not to take away my own dear lootie the nurse was comforted at hearing this and said no more they went on walking pretty fast but taking care not to run a step i want to talk to you said irene to the little miner but it's so awkward i don't know your name my name's curdie little princess what a funny name curdie what more curdie peterson what's your name please irene what more i don't know what more what more is my name lootie princesses haven't got more than one name they don't want it oh then curdie you must call me just irene and no more no indeed said the nurse indignantly he shall do no such thing what shall he call me then lootie your royal highness my royal highness what's that no no lootie i won't be called names i don't like them you told me once yourself it's only rude children that call names and i'm sure curdie wouldn't be rude curdie my name's irene well irene said curdie with a glance at the nurse which showed he enjoyed teasing her it is very kind of you to let me call you anything i like your name very much he expected the nurse to interfere again but he soon saw that she was too frightened to speak she was staring at something a few yards before them in the middle of the path where it narrowed between rocks so that only one could pass at a time it is very much kinder of you to go out of your way to take us home said irene i'm not going out of my way yet said curdie it's on the other side of those rocks the path turns off to my father's you wouldn't think of leaving us till we're safe home i'm sure gasped the nurse of course not said curdie you dear good kind curdie i'll give you a kiss when we get home said the princess the nurse gave her a great pull by the hand she held but at that instant the something in the middle of the way which had looked like a great lump of earth brought down by the rain began to move one after another it shot out four long things like two arms and two legs but it was now too dark to tell what they were the nurse began to tremble from head to foot irene clasped curdie's hand yet faster and curdie began to sing again one two hit and hew three four blast and bore five six there's a fix seven eight hold it straight nine ten hit again hurry scurry bother smother there's a toad in the road smash it squash it fry it dry it you're another up and off there's enough huuuuuh as he uttered the last words curdie let go his hold of his companion and rushed at the thing in the road as if he would trample it under his feet it gave a great spring and ran straight up one of the rocks like a huge spider curdie turned back laughing and took irene's hand again she grasped his very tight but said nothing till they had passed the rocks a few yards more and she found herself on a part of the road she knew and was able to speak again do you know curdie i don't quite like your song it sounds to me rather rude she said well perhaps it is answered curdie i never thought of that it's a way we have we do it because they don't like it who don't like it the cobs as we call them don't said the nurse why not said curdie i beg you won't please don't oh if you ask me that way of course i won't though i don't a bit know why look there are the lights of your great house down below you'll be at home in five minutes now nothing more happened they reached home in safety nobody had missed them or even known they had gone out and they arrived at the door belonging to their part of the house without anyone seeing them the nurse was rushing in with a hurried and not over gracious good night to curdie but the princess pulled her hand from hers and was just throwing her arms round curdie's neck when she caught her again and dragged her away lootie lootie i promised a kiss cried irene a princess mustn't give kisses it's not at all proper said lootie but i promised said the princess there's no occasion he's only a miner boy he's a good boy and a brave boy and he has been very kind to us lootie lootie i promised then you shouldn't have promised lootie i promised him a kiss your royal highness said lootie suddenly grown very respectful must come in directly nurse a princess must not break her word said irene drawing herself up and standing stock still lootie did not know which the king might count the worst to let the princess be out after sunset or to let her kiss a miner boy she did not know that being a gentleman as many kings have been he would have counted neither of them the worse however much he might have disliked his daughter to kiss the miner boy he would not have had her break her word for all the goblins in creation but as i say the nurse was not lady enough to understand this and so she was in a great difficulty for if she insisted someone might hear the princess cry and run to see and then all would come out but here curdie came again to the rescue never mind princess irene he said you mustn't kiss me tonight but you shan't break your word i will come another time you may be sure i will oh thank you curdie said the princess and stopped crying good night irene good night lootie said curdie and turned and was out of sight in a moment i should like to see him muttered the nurse as she carried the princess to the nursery you will see him said irene you may be sure curdie will keep his word he's sure to come again i should like to see him repeated the nurse and said no more she did not want to open a new cause of strife with the princess by saying more plainly what she meant glad enough that she had succeeded both in getting home unseen and in keeping the princess from kissing the miner's boy she resolved to watch her far better in future her carelessness had already doubled the danger she was in formerly the goblins were her only fear now she had to protect her charge from curdie as well chapter 7 the mines curdie went home whistling he resolved to say nothing about the princess for fear of getting the nurse into trouble for while he enjoyed teasing her because of her absurdity he was careful not to do her any harm he saw no more of the goblins and was soon fast asleep in his bed he woke in the middle of the night and thought he heard curious noises outside he sat up and listened then got up and opening the door very quietly went out when he peeped round the corner he saw under his own window a group of stumpy creatures whom he at once recognized by their shape hardly however had he begun his one two three when they broke asunder scurried away and were out of sight he returned laughing got into bed again and was fast asleep in a moment reflecting a little over the matter in the morning he came to the conclusion that as nothing of the kind had ever happened before they must be annoyed with him for interfering to protect the princess by the time he was dressed however he was thinking of something quite different for he did not value the enmity of the goblins in the least as soon as they had had breakfast he set off with his father for the mine they entered the hill by a natural opening under a huge rock where a little stream rushed out they followed its course for a few yards when the passage took a turn and sloped steeply into the heart of the hill with many angles and windings and branchings off and sometimes with steps where it came upon a natural gulf it led them deep into the hill before they arrived at the place where they were at present digging out the precious ore this was of various kinds for the mountain was very rich in the better sorts of metals with flint and steel and tinder box they lighted their lamps then fixed them on their heads and were soon hard at work with their pickaxes and shovels and hammers father and son were at work near each other but not in the same gang the passages out of which the ore was dug they called gangs for when the lode or vein of ore was small one miner would have to dig away alone in a passage no bigger than gave him just room to work sometimes in uncomfortable cramped positions if they stopped for a moment they could hear everywhere around them some nearer some farther off the sounds of their companions burrowing away in all directions in the inside of the great mountain some boring holes in the rock in order to blow it up with gunpowder others shovelling the broken ore into baskets to be carried to the mouth of the mine others hitting away with their pickaxes sometimes if the miner was in a very lonely part he would hear only a tap tapping no louder than that of a woodpecker for the sound would come from a great distance off through the solid mountain rock the work was hard at best for it is very warm underground but it was not particularly unpleasant and some of the miners when they wanted to earn a little more money for a particular purpose would stop behind the rest and work all night but you could not tell night from day down there except from feeling tired and sleepy for no light of the sun ever came into those gloomy regions some who had thus remained behind during the night although certain there were none of their companions at work would declare the next morning that they heard every time they halted for a moment to take breath a tap tapping all about them as if the mountain were then more full of miners than ever it was during the day and some in consequence would never stay overnight for all knew those were the sounds of the goblins they worked only at night for the miners night was the goblins day indeed the greater number of the miners were afraid of the goblins for there were strange stories well known amongst them of the treatment some had received whom the goblins had surprised at their work during the night the more courageous of them however amongst them peter peterson and curdie who in this took after his father had stayed in the mine all night again and again and although they had several times encountered a few stray goblins had never yet failed in driving them away as i have indicated already the chief defence against them was verse for they hated verse of every kind and some kinds they could not endure at all i suspect they could not make any themselves and that was why they disliked it so much at all events those who were most afraid of them were those who could neither make verses themselves nor remember the verses that other people made for them while those who were never afraid were those who could make verses for themselves for although there were certain old rhymes which were very effectual yet it was well known that a new rhyme if of the right sort was even more distasteful to them and therefore more effectual in putting them to flight perhaps my readers may be wondering what the goblins could be about working all night long seeing they never carried up the ore and sold it but when i have informed them concerning what curdie learned the very next night they will be able to understand for curdie had determined if his father would permit him to remain there alone this night and that for two reasons first he wanted to get extra wages that he might buy a very warm red petticoat for his mother who had begun to complain of the cold of the mountain air sooner than usual this autumn and second he had just a faint hope of finding out what the goblins were about under his window the night before when he told his father he made no objection for he had great confidence in his boy's courage and resources i'm sorry i can't stay with you said peter but i want to go and pay the parson a"
