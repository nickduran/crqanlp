"1" "a careless and hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing room with the detachment of an invited guest and saying my wife's gloxinias are a marvel aren't they i believe she gets them out from kew mr beaufort's secret people were agreed was the way he carried things off it was all very well to whisper that he had been helped to leave england by the international banking house in which he had been employed he carried off that rumour as easily as the rest though new york's business conscience was no less sensitive than its moral standard he carried everything before him and all new york into his drawing rooms and for over twenty years now people had said they were going to the beauforts with the same tone of security as if they had said they were going to mrs manson mingott's and with the added satisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvas back ducks and vintage wines instead of tepid veuve clicquot without a year and warmed up croquettes from philadelphia mrs beaufort then had as usual appeared in her box just before the jewel song and when again as usual she rose at the end of the third act drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders and disappeared new york knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin the beaufort house was one that new yorkers were proud to show to foreigners especially on the night of the annual ball the beauforts had been among the first people in new york to own their own red velvet carpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen under their own awning instead of hiring it with the supper and the ball room chairs they had also inaugurated the custom of letting the ladies take their cloaks off in the hall instead of shuffling up to the hostess's bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of the gas burner beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed all his wife's friends had maids who saw to it that they were properly coiffees when they left home then the house had been boldly planned with a ball room so that instead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it as at the chiverses one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed drawing rooms the sea green the crimson and the bouton d'or seeing from afar the many candled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry and beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and tree ferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and gold bamboo newland archer as became a young man of his position strolled in somewhat late he had left his overcoat with the silk stockinged footmen the stockings were one of beaufort's few fatuities had dawdled a while in the library hung with spanish leather and furnished with buhl and malachite where a few men were chatting and putting on their dancing gloves and had finally joined the line of guests whom mrs beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimson drawing room archer was distinctly nervous he had not gone back to his club after the opera as the young bloods usually did but the night being fine had walked for some distance up fifth avenue before turning back in the direction of the beauforts house he was definitely afraid that the mingotts might be going too far that in fact they might have granny mingott's orders to bring the countess olenska to the ball from the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake that would be and though he was more than ever determined to see the thing through he felt less chivalrously eager to champion his betrothed's cousin than before their brief talk at the opera wandering on to the bouton d'or drawing room where beaufort had had the audacity to hang love victorious the much discussed nude of bouguereau archer found mrs welland and her daughter standing near the ball room door couples were already gliding over the floor beyond the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts on girlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms on the dashing aigrettes and ornaments of the young married women's coiffures and on the glitter of highly glazed shirt fronts and fresh glace gloves miss welland evidently about to join the dancers hung on the threshold her lilies of the valley in her hand she carried no other bouquet her face a little pale her eyes burning with a candid excitement a group of young men and girls were gathered about her and there was much hand clasping laughing and pleasantry on which mrs welland standing slightly apart shed the beam of a qualified approval it was evident that miss welland was in the act of announcing her engagement while her mother affected the air of parental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion archer paused a moment it was at his express wish that the announcement had been made and yet it was not thus that he would have wished to have his happiness known to proclaim it in the heat and noise of a crowded ball room was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy which should belong to things nearest the heart his joy was so deep that this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched but he would have liked to keep the surface pure too it was something of a satisfaction to find that may welland shared this feeling her eyes fled to his beseechingly and their look said remember we're doing this because it's right no appeal could have found a more immediate response in archer's breast but he wished that the necessity of their action had been represented by some ideal reason and not simply by poor ellen olenska the group about miss welland made way for him with significant smiles and after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothed into the middle of the ball room floor and put his arm about her waist now we shan't have to talk he said smiling into her candid eyes as they floated away on the soft waves of the blue danube she made no answer her lips trembled into a smile but the eyes remained distant and serious as if bent on some ineffable vision dear archer whispered pressing her to him it was borne in on him that the first hours of being engaged even if spent in a ball room had in them something grave and sacramental what a new life it was going to be with this whiteness radiance goodness at one's side the dance over the two as became an affianced couple wandered into the conservatory and sitting behind a tall screen of tree ferns and camellias newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips you see i did as you asked me to she said yes i couldn't wait he answered smiling after a moment he added only i wish it hadn't had to be at a ball yes i know she met his glance comprehendingly but after all even here we're alone together aren't we oh dearest always archer cried evidently she was always going to understand she was always going to say the right thing the discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow and he went on gaily the worst of it is that i want to kiss you and i can't as he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory assured himself of their momentary privacy and catching her to him laid a fugitive pressure on her lips to counteract the audacity of this proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part of the conservatory and sitting down beside her broke a lily of the valley from her bouquet she sat silent and the world lay like a sunlit valley at their feet did you tell my cousin ellen she asked presently as if she spoke through a dream he roused himself and remembered that he had not done so some invincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreign woman had checked the words on his lips no i hadn't the chance after all he said fibbing hastily ah she looked disappointed but gently resolved on gaining her point you must then for i didn't either and i shouldn't like her to think of course not but aren't you after all the person to do it she pondered on this if i'd done it at the right time yes but now that there's been a delay i think you must explain that i'd asked you to tell her at the opera before our speaking about it to everybody here otherwise she might think i had forgotten her you see she's one of the family and she's been away so long that she's rather sensitive archer looked at her glowingly dear and great angel of course i'll tell her he glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowded ball room but i haven't seen her yet has she come no at the last minute she decided not to at the last minute he echoed betraying his surprise that she should ever have considered the alternative possible yes she's awfully fond of dancing the young girl answered simply but suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasn't smart enough for a ball though we thought it so lovely and so my aunt had to take her home oh well said archer with happy indifference nothing about his betrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry to its utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the unpleasant in which they had both been brought up she knows as well as i do he reflected the real reason of her cousin's staying away but i shall never let her see by the least sign that i am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor ellen olenska's reputation iv in the course of the next day the first of the usual betrothal visits were exchanged the new york ritual was precise and inflexible in such matters and in conformity with it newland archer first went with his mother and sister to call on mrs welland after which he and mrs welland and may drove out to old mrs manson mingott's to receive that venerable ancestress's blessing a visit to mrs manson mingott was always an amusing episode to the young man the house in itself was already an historic document though not of course as venerable as certain other old family houses in university place and lower fifth avenue those were of the purest 1830 with a grim harmony of cabbage rose garlanded carpets rosewood consoles round arched fire places with black marble mantels and immense glazed book cases of mahogany whereas old mrs mingott who had built her house later had bodily cast out the massive furniture of her prime and mingled with the mingott heirlooms the frivolous upholstery of the second empire it was her habit to sit in a window of her sitting room on the ground floor as if watching calmly for life and fashion to flow northward to her solitary doors she seemed in no hurry to have them come for her patience was equalled by her confidence she was sure that presently the hoardings the quarries the one story saloons the wooden green houses in ragged gardens and the rocks from which goats surveyed the scene would vanish before the advance of residences as stately as her own perhaps for she was an impartial woman even statelier and that the cobble stones over which the old clattering omnibuses bumped would be replaced by smooth asphalt such as people reported having seen in paris meanwhile as every one she cared to see came to her and she could fill her rooms as easily as the beauforts and without adding a single item to the menu of her suppers she did not suffer from her geographic isolation the immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle life like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump active little woman with a neatly turned foot and ankle into something as vast and august as a natural phenomenon she had accepted this submergence as philosophically as all her other trials and now in extreme old age was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost unwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh in the centre of which the traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation a flight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of a still snowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by a miniature portrait of the late mr mingott and around and below wave after wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capacious armchair with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface of the billows the burden of mrs manson mingott's flesh had long since made it impossible for her to go up and down stairs and with characteristic independence she had made her reception rooms upstairs and established herself in flagrant violation of all the new york proprieties on the ground floor of her house so that as you sat in her sitting room window with her you caught through a door that was always open and a looped back yellow damask portiere the unexpected vista of a bedroom with a huge low bed upholstered like a sofa and a toilet table with frivolous lace flounces and a gilt framed mirror her visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this arrangement which recalled scenes in french fiction and architectural incentives to immorality such as the simple american had never dreamed of that was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies in apartments with all the rooms on one floor and all the indecent propinquities that their novels described it amused newland archer who had secretly situated the love scenes of monsieur de camors in mrs mingott's bedroom to picture her blameless life led in the stage setting of adultery but he said to himself with considerable admiration that if a lover had been what she wanted the intrepid woman would have had him too to the general relief the countess olenska was not present in her grandmother's drawing room during the visit of the betrothed couple mrs mingott said she had gone out which on a day of such glaring sunlight and at the shopping hour seemed in itself an indelicate thing for a compromised woman to do but at any rate it spared them the embarrassment of her presence and the faint shadow that her unhappy past might seem to shed on their radiant future the visit went off successfully as was to have been expected old mrs mingott was delighted with the engagement which being long foreseen by watchful relatives had been carefully passed upon in family council and the engagement ring a large thick sapphire set in invisible claws met with her unqualified admiration it's the new setting of course it shows the stone beautifully but it looks a little bare to old fashioned eyes mrs welland had explained with a conciliatory side glance at her future son in law old fashioned eyes i hope you don't mean mine my dear i like all the novelties said the ancestress lifting the stone to her small bright orbs which no glasses had ever disfigured very handsome she added returning the jewel very liberal in my time a cameo set in pearls was thought sufficient but it's the hand that sets off the ring isn't it my dear mr archer and she waved one of her tiny hands with small pointed nails and rolls of aged fat encircling the wrist like ivory bracelets mine was modelled in rome by the great ferrigiani you should have may's done no doubt he'll have it done my child her hand is large it's these modern sports that spread the joints but the skin is white and when's the wedding to be she broke off fixing her eyes on archer's face oh mrs welland murmured while the young man smiling at his betrothed replied as soon as ever it can if only you'll back me up mrs mingott we must give them time to get to know each other a little better mamma mrs welland interposed with the proper affectation of reluctance to which the ancestress rejoined know each other fiddlesticks everybody in new york has always known everybody let the young man have his way my dear don't wait till the bubble's off the wine marry them before lent i may catch pneumonia any winter now and i want to give the wedding breakfast these successive statements were received with the proper expressions of amusement incredulity and gratitude and the visit was breaking up in a vein of mild pleasantry when the door opened to admit the countess olenska who entered in bonnet and mantle followed by the unexpected figure of julius beaufort there was a cousinly murmur of pleasure between the ladies and mrs mingott held out ferrigiani's model to the banker ha beaufort this is a rare favour she had an odd foreign way of addressing men by their surnames thanks i wish it might happen oftener said the visitor in his easy arrogant way i'm generally so tied down but i met the countess ellen in madison square and she was good enough to let me walk home with her ah i hope the house will be gayer now that ellen's here cried mrs mingott with a glorious effrontery sit down sit down beaufort push up the yellow armchair now i've got you i want a good gossip i hear your ball was magnificent and i understand you invited mrs lemuel struthers well i've a curiosity to see the woman myself she had forgotten her relatives who were drifting out into the hall under ellen olenska's guidance old mrs mingott had always professed a great admiration for julius beaufort and there was a kind of kinship in their cool domineering way and their short cuts through the conventions now she was eagerly curious to know what had decided the beauforts to invite for the first time mrs lemuel struthers the widow of struthers's shoe polish who had returned the previous year from a long initiatory sojourn in europe to lay siege to the tight little citadel of new york of course if you and regina invite her the thing is settled well we need new blood and new money and i hear she's still very good looking the carnivorous old lady declared in the hall while mrs welland and may drew on their furs archer saw that the countess olenska was looking at him with a faintly questioning smile of course you know already about may and me he said answering her look with a shy laugh she scolded me for not giving you the news last night at the opera i had her orders to tell you that we were engaged but i couldn't in that crowd the smile passed from countess olenska's eyes to her lips she looked younger more like the bold brown ellen mingott of his boyhood of course i know yes and i'm so glad but one doesn't tell such things first in a crowd the ladies were on the threshold and she held out her hand good bye come and see me some day she said still looking at archer in the carriage on the way down fifth avenue they talked pointedly of mrs mingott of her age her spirit and all her wonderful attributes no one alluded to ellen olenska but archer knew that mrs welland was thinking it's a mistake for ellen to be seen the very day after her arrival parading up fifth avenue at the crowded hour with julius beaufort and the young man himself mentally added and she ought to know that a man who's just engaged doesn't spend his time calling on married women but i daresay in the set she's lived in they do they never do anything else and in spite of the cosmopolitan views on which he prided himself he thanked heaven that he was a new yorker and about to ally himself with one of his own kind v the next evening old mr sillerton jackson came to dine with the archers mrs archer was a shy woman and shrank from society but she liked to be well informed as to its doings her old friend mr sillerton jackson applied to the investigation of his friends affairs the patience of a collector and the science of a naturalist and his sister miss sophy jackson who lived with him and was entertained by all the people who could not secure her much sought after brother brought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in his picture therefore whenever anything happened that mrs archer wanted to know about she asked mr jackson to dine and as she honoured few people with her invitations and as she and her daughter janey were an excellent audience mr jackson usually came himself instead of sending his sister if he could have dictated all the conditions he would have chosen the evenings when newland was out not because the young man was uncongenial to him the two got on capitally at their club but because the old anecdotist sometimes felt on newland's part a tendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family never showed mr jackson if perfection had been attainable on earth would also have asked that mrs archer's food should be a little better but then new york as far back as the mind of man could travel had been divided into the two great fundamental groups of the mingotts and mansons and all their clan who cared about eating and clothes and money and the archer newland van der luyden tribe who were devoted to travel horticulture and the best fiction and looked down on the grosser forms of pleasure you couldn't have everything after all if you dined with the lovell mingotts you got canvas back and terrapin and vintage wines at adeline archer's you could talk about alpine scenery and the marble faun and luckily the archer madeira had gone round the cape therefore when a friendly summons came from mrs archer mr jackson who was a true eclectic would usually say to his sister i've been a little gouty since my last dinner at the lovell mingotts it will do me good to diet at adeline's mrs archer who had long been a widow lived with her son and daughter in west twenty eighth street an upper floor was dedicated to newland and the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below in an unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in wardian cases made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen collected american revolutionary glazed ware subscribed to good words and read ouida's novels for the sake of the italian atmosphere they preferred those about peasant life because of the descriptions of scenery and the pleasanter sentiments though in general they liked novels about people in society whose motives and habits were more comprehensible spoke severely of dickens who had never drawn a gentleman and considered thackeray less at home in the great world than bulwer who however was beginning to be thought old fashioned mrs and miss archer were both great lovers of scenery it was what they principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad considering architecture and painting as subjects for men and chiefly for learned persons who read ruskin mrs archer had been born a newland and mother and daughter who were as like as sisters were both as people said true newlands tall pale and slightly round shouldered with long noses sweet smiles and a kind of drooping distinction like that in certain faded reynolds portraits their physical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpoint had not stretched mrs archer's black brocade while miss archer's brown and purple poplins hung as the years went on more and more slackly on her virgin frame mentally the likeness between them as newland was aware was less complete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear the long habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had given them the same vocabulary and the same habit of beginning their phrases mother thinks or janey thinks according as one or the other wished to advance an opinion of her own but in reality while mrs archer's serene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar janey was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up from springs of suppressed romance mother and daughter adored each other and revered their son and brother and archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious and uncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration and by his secret satisfaction in it after all he thought it a good thing for a man to have his authority respected in his own house even if his sense of humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate on this occasion the young man was very sure that mr jackson would rather have had him dine out but he had his own reasons for not doing so of course old jackson wanted to talk about ellen olenska and of course mrs archer and janey wanted to hear what he had to tell all three would be slightly embarrassed by newland's presence now that his prospective relation to the mingott clan had been made known and the young man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn the difficulty they began obliquely by talking about mrs lemuel struthers it's a pity the beauforts asked her mrs archer said gently but then regina always does what he tells her and beaufort certain nuances escape beaufort said mr jackson cautiously inspecting the broiled shad and wondering for the thousandth time why mrs archer's cook always burnt the roe to a cinder newland who had long shared his wonder could always detect it in the older man's expression of melancholy disapproval oh necessarily beaufort is a vulgar man said mrs archer my grandfather newland always used to say to my mother whatever you do don't let that fellow beaufort be introduced to the girls but at least he's had the advantage of associating with gentlemen in england too they say it's all very mysterious she glanced at janey and paused she and janey knew every fold of the beaufort mystery but in public mrs archer continued to assume that the subject was not one for the unmarried but this mrs struthers mrs archer continued what did you say she was sillerton out of a mine or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit then with living wax works touring new england after the police broke that up they say she lived mr jackson in his turn glanced at janey whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids there were still hiatuses for her in mrs struthers's past then mr jackson continued and archer saw he was wondering why no one had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife then lemuel struthers came along they say his advertiser used the girl's head for the shoe polish posters her hair's intensely black you know the egyptian style anyhow he eventually married her there were volumes of innuendo in the way the eventually was spaced and each syllable given its due stress oh well at the pass we've come to nowadays it doesn't matter said mrs archer indifferently the ladies were not really interested in mrs struthers just then the subject of ellen olenska was too fresh and too absorbing to them indeed mrs struthers's name had been introduced by mrs archer only that she might presently be able to say and newland's new cousin countess olenska was she at the ball too there was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son and archer knew it and had expected it even mrs archer who was seldom unduly pleased with human events had been altogether glad of her son's engagement especially after that silly business with mrs rushworth as she had remarked to janey alluding to what had once seemed to newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear the scar there was no better match in new york than may welland look at the question from whatever point you chose of course such a marriage was only what newland was entitled to but young men are so foolish and incalculable and some women so ensnaring and unscrupulous that it was nothing short of a miracle to see one's only son safe past the siren isle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity all this mrs archer felt and her son knew she felt but he knew also that she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of his engagement or rather by its cause and it was for that reason because on the whole he was a tender and indulgent master that he had stayed at home that evening it's not that i don't approve of the mingotts esprit de corps but why newland's engagement should be mixed up with that olenska woman's comings and goings i don't see mrs archer grumbled to janey the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect sweetness she had behaved beautifully and in beautiful behaviour
