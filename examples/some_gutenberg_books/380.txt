startled into a more natural tone na na it's no sae bad as that it's the mistress my lord she just fair flittit before my e'en she just gi'ed a sab and was by wi it eh my bonny miss jeannie that i mind sae weel and forth again upon that pouring tide of lamentation in which women of her class excel and over abound lord hermiston sat in the saddle beholding her then he seemed to recover command upon himself well it's something of the suddenest said he but she was a dwaibly body from the first and he rode home at a precipitate amble with kirstie at his horse's heels dressed as she was for her last walk they had laid the dead lady on her bed she was never interesting in life in death she was not impressive and as her husband stood before her with his hands crossed behind his powerful back that which he looked upon was the very image of the insignificant her and me were never cut out for one another he remarked at last it was a daft like marriage and then with a most unusual gentleness of tone puir bitch said he puir bitch then suddenly where's erchie kirstie had decoyed him to her room and given him a jeely piece ye have some kind of gumption too observed the judge and considered his housekeeper grimly when all's said he added i micht have done waur i micht have been marriet upon a skirting jezebel like you there's naebody thinking of you hermiston cried the offended woman we think of her that's out of her sorrows and could _she_ have done waur tell me that hermiston tell me that before her clay cauld corp weel there's some of them gey an ill to please observed his lordship chapter ii father and son my lord justice clerk was known to many the man adam weir perhaps to none he had nothing to explain or to conceal he sufficed wholly and silently to himself and that part of our nature which goes out too often with false coin to acquire glory or love seemed in him to be omitted he did not try to be loved he did not care to be it is probable the very thought of it was a stranger to his mind he was an admired lawyer a highly unpopular judge and he looked down upon those who were his inferiors in either distinction who were lawyers of less grasp or judges not so much detested in all the rest of his days and doings not one trace of vanity appeared and he went on through life with a mechanical movement as of the unconscious that was almost august he saw little of his son in the childish maladies with which the boy was troubled he would make daily inquiries and daily pay him a visit entering the sick room with a facetious and appalling countenance letting off a few perfunctory jests and going again swiftly to the patient's relief once a court holiday falling opportunely my lord had his carriage and drove the child himself to hermiston the customary place of convalescence it is conceivable he had been more than usually anxious for that journey always remained in archie's memory as a thing apart his father having related to him from beginning to end and with much detail three authentic murder cases archie went the usual round of other edinburgh boys the high school and the college and hermiston looked on or rather looked away with scarce an affectation of interest in his progress daily indeed upon a signal after dinner he was brought in given nuts and a glass of port regarded sardonically sarcastically questioned well sir and what have you donn with your book to day my lord might begin and set him posers in law latin to a child just stumbling into corderius papinian and paul proved quite invincible but papa had memory of no other he was not harsh to the little scholar having a vast fund of patience learned upon the bench and was at no pains whether to conceal or to express his disappointment well ye have a long jaunt before ye yet he might observe yawning and fall back on his own thoughts as like as not until the time came for separation and my lord would take the decanter and the glass and be off to the back chamber looking on the meadows where he toiled on his cases till the hours were small there was no fuller man on the bench his memory was marvellous though wholly legal if he had to advise extempore none did it better yet there was none who more earnestly prepared as he thus watched in the night or sat at table and forgot the presence of his son no doubt but he tasted deeply of recondite pleasures to be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life and perhaps only in law and the higher mathematics may this devotion be maintained suffice to itself without reaction and find continual rewards without excitement this atmosphere of his father's sterling industry was the best of archie's education assuredly it did not attract him assuredly it rather rebutted and depressed yet it was still present unobserved like the ticking of a clock an arid ideal a tasteless stimulant in the boy's life but hermiston was not all of one piece he was besides a mighty toper he could sit at wine until the day dawned and pass directly from the table to the bench with a steady hand and a clear head beyond the third bottle he showed the plebeian in a larger print the low gross accent the low foul mirth grew broader and commoner he became less formidable and infinitely more disgusting now the boy had inherited from jean rutherford a shivering delicacy unequally mated with potential violence in the playing fields and amongst his own companions he repaid a coarse expression with a blow at his father's table when the time came for him to join these revels he turned pale and sickened in silence of all the guests whom he there encountered he had toleration for only one david keith carnegie lord glenalmond lord glenalmond was tall and emaciated with long features and long delicate hands he was often compared with the statue of forbes of culloden in the parliament house and his blue eye at more than sixty preserved some of the fire of youth his exquisite disparity with any of his fellow guests his appearance as of an artist and an aristocrat stranded in rude company riveted the boy's attention and as curiosity and interest are the things in the world that are the most immediately and certainly rewarded lord glenalmond was attracted by the boy and so this is your son hermiston he asked laying his hand on archie's shoulder he's getting a big lad hout said the gracious father just his mother over again daurna say boo to a goose but the stranger retained the boy talked to him drew him out found in him a taste for letters and a fine ardent modest youthful soul and encouraged him to be a visitor on sunday evenings in his bare cold lonely dining room where he sat and read in the isolation of a bachelor grown old in refinement the beautiful gentleness and grace of the old judge and the delicacy of his person thoughts and language spoke to archie's heart in its own tongue he conceived the ambition to be such another and when the day came for him to choose a profession it was in emulation of lord glenalmond not of lord hermiston that he chose the bar hermiston looked on at this friendship with some secret pride but openly with the intolerance of scorn he scarce lost an opportunity to put them down with a rough jape and to say truth it was not difficult for they were neither of them quick he had a word of contempt for the whole crowd of poets painters fiddlers and their admirers the bastard race of amateurs which was continually on his lips signor feedle eerie he would say o for goad's sake no more of the signor you and my father are great friends are you not asked archie once there is no man that i more respect archie replied lord glenalmond he is two things of price he is a great lawyer and he is upright as the day you and he are so different said the boy his eyes dwelling on those of his old friend like a lover's on his mistress's indeed so replied the judge very different and so i fear are you and he yet i would like it very ill if my young friend were to misjudge his father he has all the roman virtues cato and brutus were such i think a son's heart might well be proud of such an ancestry of one and i would sooner he were a plaided herd cried archie with sudden bitterness and that is neither very wise nor i believe entirely true returned glenalmond before you are done you will find some of these expressions rise on you like a remorse they are merely literary and decorative they do not aptly express your thought nor is your thought clearly apprehended and no doubt your father if he were here would say signor feedle eerie with the infinitely delicate sense of youth archie avoided the subject from that hour it was perhaps a pity had he but talked talked freely let himself gush out in words the way youth loves to do and should there might have been no tale to write upon the weirs of hermiston but the shadow of a threat of ridicule sufficed in the slight tartness of these words he read a prohibition and it is likely that glenalmond meant it so besides the veteran the boy was without confidant or friend serious and eager he came through school and college and moved among a crowd of the indifferent in the seclusion of his shyness he grew up handsome with an open speaking countenance with graceful youthful ways he was clever he took prizes he shone in the speculative society it should seem he must become the centre of a crowd of friends but something that was in part the delicacy of his mother in part the austerity of his father held him aloof from all it is a fact and a strange one that among his contemporaries hermiston's son was thought to be a chip of the old block you're a friend of archie weir's said one to frank innes and innes replied with his usual flippancy and more than his usual insight i know weir but i never met archie no one had met archie a malady most incident to only sons he flew his private signal and none heeded it it seemed he was abroad in a world from which the very hope of intimacy was banished and he looked round about him on the concourse of his fellow students and forward to the trivial days and acquaintances that were to come without hope or interest as time went on the tough and rough old sinner felt himself drawn to the son of his loins and sole continuator of his new family with softnesses of sentiment that he could hardly credit and was wholly impotent to express with a face voice and manner trained through forty years to terrify and repel rhadamanthus may be great but he will scarce be engaging it is a fact that he tried to propitiate archie but a fact that cannot be too lightly taken the attempt was so unconspicuously made the failure so stoically supported sympathy is not due to these steadfast iron natures if he failed to gain his son's friendship or even his son's toleration on he went up the great bare staircase of his duty uncheered and undepressed there might have been more pleasure in his relations with archie so much he may have recognised at moments but pleasure was a by product of the singular chemistry of life which only fools expected an idea of archie's attitude since we are all grown up and have forgotten the days of our youth it is more difficult to convey he made no attempt whatsoever to understand the man with whom he dined and breakfasted parsimony of pain glut of pleasure these are the two alternating ends of youth and archie was of the parsimonious the wind blew cold out of a certain quarter he turned his back upon it stayed as little as was possible in his father's presence and when there averted his eyes as much as was decent from his father's face the lamp shone for many hundred days upon these two at table my lord ruddy gloomy and unreverent archie with a potential brightness that was always dimmed and veiled in that society and there were not perhaps in christendom two men more radically strangers the father with a grand simplicity either spoke of what interested himself or maintained an unaffected silence the son turned in his head for some topic that should be quite safe that would spare him fresh evidences either of my lord's inherent grossness or of the innocence of his inhumanity treading gingerly the ways of intercourse like a lady gathering up her skirts in a by path if he made a mistake and my lord began to abound in matter of offence archie drew himself up his brow grew dark his share of the talk expired but my lord would faithfully and cheerfully continue to pour out the worst of himself before his silent and offended son well it's a poor hert that never rejoices he would say at the conclusion of such a nightmare interview but i must get to my plew stilts and he would seclude himself as usual in his back room and archie go forth into the night and the city quivering with animosity and scorn chapter iii in the matter of the hanging of duncan jopp it chanced in the year 1813 that archie strayed one day into the justiciary court the macer made room for the son of the presiding judge in the dock the centre of men's eyes there stood a whey coloured misbegotten caitiff duncan jopp on trial for his life his story as it was raked out before him in that public scene was one of disgrace and vice and cowardice the very nakedness of crime and the creature heard and it seemed at times as though he understood as if at times he forgot the horror of the place he stood in and remembered the shame of what had brought him there he kept his head bowed and his hands clutched upon the rail his hair dropped in his eyes and at times he flung it back and now he glanced about the audience in a sudden fellness of terror and now looked in the face of his judge and gulped there was pinned about his throat a piece of dingy flannel and this it was perhaps that turned the scale in archie's mind between disgust and pity the creature stood in a vanishing point yet a little while and he was still a man and had eyes and apprehension yet a little longer and with a last sordid piece of pageantry he would cease to be and here in the meantime with a trait of human nature that caught at the beholder's breath he was tending a sore throat over against him my lord hermiston occupied the bench in the red robes of criminal jurisdiction his face framed in the white wig honest all through he did not affect the virtue of impartiality this was no case for refinement there was a man to be hanged he would have said and he was hanging him nor was it possible to see his lordship and acquit him of gusto in the task it was plain he gloried in the exercise of his trained faculties in the clear sight which pierced at once into the joint of fact in the rude unvarnished gibes with which he demolished every figment of defence he took his ease and jested unbending in that solemn place with some of the freedom of the tavern and the rag of man with the flannel round his neck was hunted gallowsward with jeers duncan had a mistress scarce less forlorn and greatly older than himself who came up whimpering and curtseying to add the weight of her betrayal my lord gave her the oath in his most roaring voice and added an intolerant warning mind what ye say now janet said he i have an e'e upon ye i'm ill to jest with presently after she was tremblingly embarked on her story and what made ye do this ye auld runt the court interposed do ye mean to tell me ye was the panel's mistress if you please ma loard whined the female godsake ye made a bonny couple observed his lordship and there was something so formidable and ferocious in his scorn that not even the galleries thought to laugh the summing up contained some jewels these two peetiable creatures seem to have made up thegither it's not for us to explain why the panel who whatever else he may be appears to be equally ill set out in mind and boady neither the panel nor yet the old wife appears to have had so much common sense as even to tell a lie when it was necessary and in the course of sentencing my lord had this _obiter dictum_ i have been the means under god of haanging a great number but never just such a disjaskit rascal as yourself the words were strong in themselves the light and heat and detonation of their delivery and the savage pleasure of the speaker in his task made them tingle in the ears when all was over archie came forth again into a changed world had there been the least redeeming greatness in the crime any obscurity any dubiety perhaps he might have understood but the culprit stood with his sore throat in the sweat of his mortal agony without defence or excuse a thing to cover up with blushes a being so much sunk beneath the zones of sympathy that pity might seem harmless and the judge had pursued him with a monstrous relishing gaiety horrible to be conceived a trait for nightmares it is one thing to spear a tiger another to crush a toad there are aesthetics even of the slaughter house and the loathsomeness of duncan jopp enveloped and infected the image of his judge archie passed by his friends in the high street with incoherent words and gestures he saw holyrood in a dream remembrance of its romance awoke in him and faded he had a vision of the old radiant stories of queen mary and prince charlie of the hooded stag of the splendour and crime the velvet and bright iron of the past and dismissed them with a cry of pain he lay and moaned in the hunter's bog and the heavens were dark above him and the grass of the field an offence this is my father he said i draw my life from him the flesh upon my bones is his the bread i am fed with is the wages of these horrors he recalled his mother and ground his forehead in the earth he thought of flight and where was he to flee to of other lives but was there any life worth living in this den of savage and jeering animals the interval before the execution was like a violent dream he met his father he would not look at him he could not speak to him it seemed there was no living creature but must have been swift to recognise that imminent animosity but the hide of the justice clerk remained impenetrable had my lord been talkative the truce could never have subsisted but he was by fortune in one of his humours of sour silence and under the very guns of his broadside archie nursed the enthusiasm of rebellion it seemed to him from the top of his nineteen years experience as if he were marked at birth to be the perpetrator of some signal action to set back fallen mercy to overthrow the usurping devil that sat horned and hoofed on her throne seductive jacobin figments which he had often refuted at the speculative swam up in his mind and startled him as with voices and he seemed to himself to walk accompanied by an almost tangible presence of new beliefs and duties on the named morning he was at the place of execution he saw the fleering rabble the flinching wretch produced he looked on for a while at a certain parody of devotion which seemed to strip the wretch of his last claim to manhood then followed the brutal instant of extinction and the paltry dangling of the remains like a broken jumping jack he had been prepared for something terrible not for this tragic meanness he stood a moment silent and then i denounce this god defying murder he shouted and his father if he must have disclaimed the sentiment might have owned the stentorian voice with which it was uttered frank innes dragged him from the spot the two handsome lads followed the same course of study and recreation and felt a certain mutual attraction founded mainly on good looks it had never gone deep frank was by nature a thin jeering creature not truly susceptible whether of feeling or inspiring friendship and the relation between the pair was altogether on the outside a thing of common knowledge and the pleasantries that spring from a common acquaintance the more credit to frank that he was appalled by archie's outburst and at least conceived the design of keeping him in sight and if possible in hand for the day but archie who had just defied was it god or satan would not listen to the word of a college companion i will not go with you he said i do not desire your company sir i would be alone here weir man don't be absurd said innes keeping a tight hold upon his sleeve i will not let you go until i know what you mean to do with yourself it's no use brandishing that staff for indeed at that moment archie had made a sudden perhaps a warlike movement this has been the most insane affair you know it has you know very well that i'm playing the good samaritan all i wish is to keep you quiet if quietness is what you wish mr innes said archie and you will promise to leave me entirely to myself i will tell you so much that i am going to walk in the country and admire the beauties of nature honour bright asked frank i am not in the habit of lying mr innes retorted archie i have the honour of wishing you good day you won't forget the spec asked innes the spec said archie o no i won't forget the spec and the one young man carried his tortured spirit forth of the city and all the day long by one road and another in an endless pilgrimage of misery while the other hastened smilingly to spread the news of weir's access of insanity and to drum up for that night a full attendance at the speculative where further eccentric developments might certainly be looked for i doubt if innes had the least belief in his prediction i think it flowed rather from a wish to make the story as good and the scandal as great as possible not from any ill will to archie from the mere pleasure of beholding interested faces but for all that his words were prophetic archie did not forget the spec he put in an appearance there at the due time and before the evening was over had dealt a memorable shock to his companions it chanced he was the president of the night he sat in the same room where the society still meets only the portraits were not there the men who afterwards sat for them were then but beginning their career the same lustre of many tapers shed its light over the meeting the same chair perhaps supported him that so many of us have sat in since at times he seemed to forget the business of the evening but even in these periods he sat with a great air of energy and determination at times he meddled bitterly and launched with defiance those fines which are the precious and rarely used artillery of the president he little thought as he did so how he resembled his father but his friends remarked upon it chuckling so far in his high place above his fellow students he seemed set beyond the possibility of any scandal but his mind was made up he was determined to fulfil the sphere of his offence he signed to innes whom he had just fined and who just impeached his ruling to succeed him in the chair stepped down from the platform and took his place by the chimney piece the shine of many wax tapers from above illuminating his pale face the glow of the great red fire relieving from behind his slim figure he had to propose as an amendment to the next subject in the case book whether capital punishment be consistent with god's will or man's policy a breath of embarrassment of something like alarm passed round the room so daring did these words appear upon the lips of hermiston's only son but the amendment was not seconded the previous question was promptly moved and unanimously voted and the momentary scandal smuggled by innes triumphed in the fulfilment of his prophecy he and archie were now become the heroes of the night but whereas every one crowded about innes when the meeting broke up but one of all his companions came to speak to archie weir man that was an extraordinary raid of yours observed this courageous member taking him confidentially by the arm as they went out i don't think it a raid said archie grimly more like a war i saw that poor brute hanged this morning and my gorge rises at it yet hut tut returned his companion and dropping his arm like something hot he sought the less tense society of others archie found himself alone the last of the faithful or was it only the boldest of the curious had fled he watched the black huddle of his fellow students draw off down and up the street in whispering or boisterous gangs and the isolation of the moment weighed upon him like an omen and an emblem of his destiny in life bred up in unbroken fear himself among trembling servants and in a house which at the least ruffle in the master's voice shuddered into silence he saw himself on the brink of the red valley of war and measured the danger and length of it with awe he made a detour in the glimmer and shadow of the streets came into the back stable lane and watched for a long while the light burn steady in the judge's room the longer he gazed upon that illuminated window blind the more blank became the picture of the man who sat behind it endlessly turning over sheets of process pausing to sip a glass of port or rising and passing heavily about his book lined walls to verify some reference he could not combine the brutal judge and the industrious dispassionate student the connecting link escaped him from such a dual nature it was impossible he should predict behaviour and he asked himself if he had done well to plunge into a business of which the end could not be foreseen and presently after with a sickening decline of confidence if he had done loyally to strike his father for he had struck him defied him twice over and before a cloud of witnesses struck him a public buffet before crowds who had called him to judge his father in these precarious and high questions the office was usurped it might have become a stranger in a son there was no blinking it in a son it was disloyal and now between these two natures so antipathetic so hateful to each other there was depending an unpardonable affront and the providence of god alone might foresee the manner in which it would be resented by lord hermiston these misgivings tortured him all night and arose with him in the winter's morning they followed him from class to class they made him shrinkingly sensitive to every shade of manner in his companions they sounded in his ears through the current voice of the professor and he brought them home with him at night unabated and indeed increased the cause of this increase lay in a chance encounter with the celebrated dr gregory archie stood looking vaguely in the lighted window of a book shop trying to nerve himself for the approaching ordeal my lord and he had met and parted in the morning as they had now done for long with scarcely the ordinary civilities of life and it"
