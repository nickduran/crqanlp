"1" "we had been afraid that peter would not be able to spend christmas with us his mother had wanted him home with her of course i ought to go peter had told me mournfully but we won't have turkey for dinner because ma can't afford it and ma always cries on holidays because she says they make her think of father of course she can't help it but it ain't cheerful aunt jane wouldn't have cried aunt jane used to say she never saw the man who was worth spoiling her eyes for but i guess i'll have to spend christmas at home at the last moment however a cousin of mrs craig's in charlottetown invited her for christmas and peter being given his choice of going or staying joyfully elected to stay so we were all together except sara ray who had been invited but whose mother wouldn't let her come sara ray's mother is a nuisance snapped the story girl she just lives to make that poor child miserable and she won't let her go to the party tonight either it is just breaking sara's heart that she can't said cecily compassionately i'm almost afraid i won't enjoy myself for thinking of her home there alone most likely reading the bible while we're at the party she might be worse occupied than reading the bible said felicity rebukingly but mrs ray makes her read it as a punishment protested cecily whenever sara cries to go anywhere and of course she'll cry tonight mrs ray makes her read seven chapters in the bible i wouldn't think that would make her very fond of it and i'll not be able to talk the party over with sara afterwards and that's half the fun gone you can tell her all about it comforted felix telling isn't a bit like talking it over retorted cecily it's too one sided we had an exciting time opening our presents some of us had more than others but we all received enough to make us feel comfortably that we were not unduly neglected in the matter the contents of the box which the story girl's father had sent her from paris made our eyes stick out it was full of beautiful things among them another red silk dress not the bright flame hued tint of her old one but a rich dark crimson with the most distracting flounces and bows and ruffles and with it were little red satin slippers with gold buckles and heels that made aunt janet hold up her hands in horror felicity remarked scornfully that she would have thought the story girl would get tired wearing red so much and even cecily commented apart to me that she thought when you got so many things all at once you didn't appreciate them as much as when you only got a few i'd never get tired of red said the story girl i just love it it's so rich and glowing when i'm dressed in red i always feel ever so much cleverer than in any other colour thoughts just crowd into my brain one after the other oh you darling dress you dear sheeny red rosy glistening silky thing she flung it over her shoulder and danced around the kitchen don't be silly sara said aunt janet a little stimy she was a good soul that aunt janet and had a kind loving heart in her ample bosom but i fancy there were times when she thought it rather hard that the daughter of a roving adventurer as she considered him like blair stanley should disport herself in silk dresses while her own daughters must go clad in gingham and muslin for those were the days when a feminine creature got one silk dress in her lifetime and seldom more than one the story girl also got a present from the awkward man a little shabby worn volume with a great many marks on the leaves why it isn't new it's an old book exclaimed felicity i didn't think the awkward man was mean whatever else he was oh you don't understand felicity said the story girl patiently and i don't suppose i can make you understand but i'll try i'd ten times rather have this than a new book it's one of his own don't you see one that he has read a hundred times and loved and made a friend of a new book just out of a shop wouldn't be the same thing at all it wouldn't mean anything i consider it a great compliment that he has given me this book i'm prouder of it than of anything else i've got well you're welcome to it said felicity i don't understand and i don't want to i wouldn't give anybody a christmas present that wasn't new and i wouldn't thank anybody who gave me one peter was in the seventh heaven because felicity had given him a present and moreover one that she had made herself it was a bookmark of perforated cardboard with a gorgeous red and yellow worsted goblet worked on it and below in green letters the solemn warning touch not the cup as peter was not addicted to habits of intemperance not even to looking on dandelion wine when it was pale yellow we did not exactly see why felicity should have selected such a device but peter was perfectly satisfied so nobody cast any blight on his happiness by carping criticism later on felicity told me she had worked the bookmark for him because his father used to drink before he ran away i thought peter ought to be warned in time she said even pat had a ribbon of blue which he clawed off and lost half an hour after it was tied on him pat did not care for vain adornments of the body we had a glorious christmas dinner fit for the halls of lucullus and ate far more than was good for us none daring to make us afraid on that one day of the year and in the evening oh rapture and delight we went to kitty marr's party it was a fine december evening the sharp air of morning had mellowed until it was as mild as autumn there had been no snow and the long fields sloping down from the homestead were brown and mellow a weird dreamy stillness had fallen on the purple earth the dark fir woods the valley rims the sere meadows nature seemed to have folded satisfied hands to rest knowing that her long wintry slumber was coming upon her at first when the invitations to the party had come aunt janet had said we could not go but uncle alec interceded in our favour perhaps influenced thereto by cecily's wistful eyes if uncle alec had a favourite among his children it was cecily and he had grown even more indulgent towards her of late now and then i saw him looking at her intently and following his eyes and thought i had somehow seen that cecily was paler and thinner than she had been in the summer and that her soft eyes seemed larger and that over her little face in moments of repose there was a certain languor and weariness that made it very sweet and pathetic and i heard him tell aunt janet that he did not like to see the child getting so much the look of her aunt felicity cecily is perfectly well said aunt janet sharply she's only growing very fast don't be foolish alec but after that cecily had cups of cream where the rest of us got only milk and aunt janet was very particular to see that she had her rubbers on whenever she went out on this merry christmas evening however no fears or dim foreshadowings of any coming event clouded our hearts or faces cecily looked brighter and prettier than i had ever seen her with her softly shining eyes and the nut brown gloss of her hair felicity was too beautiful for words and even the story girl between excitement and the crimson silk array blossomed out with a charm and allurement more potent than any regular loveliness and this in spite of the fact that aunt olivia had tabooed the red satin slippers and mercilessly decreed that stout shoes should be worn i know just how you feel about it you daughter of eve she said with gay sympathy but december roads are damp and if you are going to walk to marrs you are not going to do it in those frivolous parisian concoctions even with overboots on so be brave dear heart and show that you have a soul above little red satin shoes anyhow said uncle roger that red silk dress will break the hearts of all the feminine small fry at the party you'd break their spirits too if you wore the slippers don't do it sara leave them one wee loophole of enjoyment what does uncle roger mean whispered felicity he means you girls are all dying of jealousy because of the story girl's dress said dan i am not of a jealous disposition said felicity loftily and she's entirely welcome to the dress with a complexion like that but we enjoyed that party hugely every one of us and we enjoyed the walk home afterwards through dim enshadowed fields where silvery star beams lay while orion trod his stately march above us and a red moon climbed up the black horizon's rim a brook went with us part of the way singing to us through the dark a gay irresponsible vagabond of valley and wilderness felicity and peter walked not with us peter's cup must surely have brimmed over that christmas night when we left the marr house he had boldly said to felicity may i see you home and felicity much to our amazement had taken his arm and marched off with him the primness of her was indescribable and was not at all ruffled by dan's hoot of derision as for me i was consumed by a secret and burning desire to ask the story girl if i might see her home but i could not screw my courage to the sticking point how i envied peter his easy insouciant manner i could not emulate him so dan and felix and cecily and the story girl and i all walked hand in hand huddling a little closer together as we went through james frewen's woods for there are strange harps in a fir grove and who shall say what fingers sweep them mighty and sonorous was the music above our heads as the winds of the night stirred the great boughs tossing athwart the starlit sky perhaps it was that aeolian harmony which recalled to the story girl a legend of elder days i read such a pretty story in one of aunt olivia's books last night she said it was called the christmas harp would you like to hear it it seems to me it would just suit this part of the road there isn't anything about about ghosts in it is there said cecily timidly oh no i wouldn't tell a ghost story here for anything i'd frighten myself too much this story is about one of the shepherds who saw the angels on the first christmas night he was just a youth and he loved music with all his heart and he longed to be able to express the melody that was in his soul but he could not he had a harp and he often tried to play on it but his clumsy fingers only made such discord that his companions laughed at him and mocked him and called him a madman because he would not give it up but would rather sit apart by himself with his arms about his harp looking up into the sky while they gathered around their fire and told tales to wile away their long night vigils as they watched their sheep on the hills but to him the thoughts that came out of the great silence were far sweeter than their mirth and he never gave up the hope which sometimes left his lips as a prayer that some day he might be able to express those thoughts in music to the tired weary forgetful world on the first christmas night he was out with his fellow shepherds on the hills it was chill and dark and all except him were glad to gather around the fire he sat as usual by himself with his harp on his knee and a great longing in his heart and there came a marvellous light in the sky and over the hills as if the darkness of the night had suddenly blossomed into a wonderful meadow of flowery flame and all the shepherds saw the angels and heard them sing and as they sang the harp that the young shepherd held began to play softly by itself and as he listened to it he realized that it was playing the same music that the angels sang and that all his secret longings and aspirations and strivings were expressed in it from that night whenever he took the harp in his hands it played the same music and he wandered all over the world carrying it wherever the sound of its music was heard hate and discord fled away and peace and good will reigned no one who heard it could think an evil thought no one could feel hopeless or despairing or bitter or angry when a man had once heard that music it entered into his soul and heart and life and became a part of him for ever years went by the shepherd grew old and bent and feeble but still he roamed over land and sea that his harp might carry the message of the christmas night and the angel song to all mankind at last his strength failed him and he fell by the wayside in the darkness but his harp played as his spirit passed and it seemed to him that a shining one stood by him with wonderful starry eyes and said to him lo the music thy harp has played for so many years has been but the echo of the love and sympathy and purity and beauty in thine own soul and if at any time in the wanderings thou hadst opened the door of that soul to evil or envy or selfishness thy harp would have ceased to play now thy life is ended but what thou hast given to mankind has no end and as long as the world lasts so long will the heavenly music of the christmas harp ring in the ears of men when the sun rose the old shepherd lay dead by the roadside with a smile on his face and in his hands was a harp with all its strings broken we left the fir woods as the tale was ended and on the opposite hill was home a dim light in the kitchen window betokened that aunt janet had no idea of going to bed until all her young fry were safely housed for the night ma's waiting up for us said dan i'd laugh if she happened to go to the door just as felicity and peter were strutting up i guess she'll be cross it's nearly twelve christmas will soon be over said cecily with a sigh hasn't it been a nice one it's the first we've all spent together do you suppose we'll ever spend another together lots of em said dan cheerily why not oh i don't know answered cecily her footsteps lagging somewhat only things seem just a little too pleasant to last if willy fraser had had as much spunk as peter miss cecily king mightn't be so low spirited quoth dan significantly cecily tossed her head and disdained reply there are really some remarks a self respecting young lady must ignore chapter iv new year resolutions if we did not have a white christmas we had a white new year midway between the two came a heavy snowfall it was winter in our orchard of old delights then so truly winter that it was hard to believe summer had ever dwelt in it or that spring would ever return to it there were no birds to sing the music of the moon and the path where the apple blossoms had fallen were heaped with less fragrant drifts but it was a place of wonder on a moonlight night when the snowy arcades shone like avenues of ivory and crystal and the bare trees cast fairy like traceries upon them over uncle stephen's walk where the snow had fallen smoothly a spell of white magic had been woven taintless and wonderful it seemed like a street of pearl in the new jerusalem on new year's eve we were all together in uncle alec's kitchen which was tacitly given over to our revels during the winter evenings the story girl and peter were there of course and sara ray's mother had allowed her to come up on condition that she should be home by eight sharp cecily was glad to see her but the boys never hailed her arrival with over much delight because since the dark began to come down early aunt janet always made one of us walk down home with her we hated this because sara ray was always so maddeningly self conscious of having an escort we knew perfectly well that next day in school she would tell her chums as a dead secret that so and so king saw her home from the hill farm the night before now seeing a young lady home from choice and being sent home with her by your aunt or mother are two entirely different things and we thought sara ray ought to have sense enough to know it outside there was a vivid rose of sunset behind the cold hills of fir and the long reaches of snowy fields glowed fairily pink in the western light the drifts along the edges of the meadows and down the lane looked as if a series of breaking waves had by the lifting of a magician's wand been suddenly transformed into marble even to their toppling curls of foam slowly the splendour died giving place to the mystic beauty of a winter twilight when the moon is rising the hollow sky was a cup of blue the stars came out over the white glens and the earth was covered with a kingly carpet for the feet of the young year to press i'm so glad the snow came said the story girl if it hadn't the new year would have seemed just as dingy and worn out as the old there's something very solemn about the idea of a new year isn't there just think of three hundred and sixty five whole days with not a thing happened in them yet i don't suppose anything very wonderful will happen in them said felix pessimistically to felix just then life was flat stale and unprofitable because it was his turn to go home with sara ray it makes me a little frightened to think of all that may happen in them said cecily miss marwood says it is what we put into a year not what we get out of it that counts at last i'm always glad to see a new year said the story girl i wish we could do as they do in norway the whole family sits up until midnight and then just as the clock is striking twelve the father opens the door and welcomes the new year in isn't it a pretty custom if ma would let us stay up till twelve we might do that too said dan but she never will i call it mean if i ever have children i'll let them stay up to watch the new year in said the story girl decidedly so will i said peter but other nights they'll have to go to bed at seven you ought to be ashamed speaking of such things said felicity with a scandalized face peter shrank into the background abashed no doubt believing that he had broken some family guide precept all to pieces i didn't know it wasn't proper to mention children he muttered apologetically we ought to make some new year resolutions suggested the story girl new year's eve is the time to make them i can't think of any resolutions i want to make said felicity who was perfectly satisfied with herself i could suggest a few to you said dan sarcastically there are so many i would like to make said cecily that i'm afraid it wouldn't be any use trying to keep them all well let's all make a few just for the fun of it and see if we can keep them i said and let's get paper and ink and write them out that will make them seem more solemn and binding and then pin them up on our bedroom walls where we'll see them every day suggested the story girl and every time we break a resolution we must put a cross opposite it that will show us what progress we are making as well as make us ashamed if we have too many crosses and let's have a roll of honour in our magazine suggested felix and every month we'll publish the names of those who keep their resolutions perfect i think it's all nonsense said felicity but she joined our circle around the table though she sat for a long time with a blank sheet before her let's each make a resolution in turn i said i'll lead off and recalling with shame certain unpleasant differences of opinion i had lately had with felicity i wrote down in my best hand i shall try to keep my temper always you'd better said felicity tactfully it was dan's turn next i can't think of anything to start with he said gnawing his penholder fiercely you might make a resolution not to eat poison berries suggested felicity you'd better make one not to nag people everlastingly retorted dan oh don't quarrel the last night of the old year implored cecily you might resolve not to quarrel any time suggested sara ray no sir said dan emphatically there's no use making a resolution you can't keep there are people in this family you've just got to quarrel with if you want to live but i've thought of one i won't do things to spite people felicity who really was in an unbearable mood that night laughed disagreeably but cecily gave her a fierce nudge which probably restrained her from speaking i will not eat any apples wrote felix what on earth do you want to give up eating apples for asked peter in astonishment never mind returned felix apples make people fat you know said felicity sweetly it seems a funny kind of resolution i said doubtfully i think our resolutions ought to be giving up wrong things or doing right ones you make your resolutions to suit yourself and i'll make mine to suit myself said felix defiantly i shall never get drunk wrote peter painstakingly but you never do said the story girl in astonishment well it will be all the easier to keep the resolution argued peter that isn't fair complained dan if we all resolved not to do the things we never do we'd all be on the roll of honour you let peter alone said felicity severely it's a very good resolution and one everybody ought to make i shall not be jealous wrote the story girl but are you i asked surprised the story girl coloured and nodded of one thing she confessed but i'm not going to tell what it is i'm jealous sometimes too confessed sara ray and so my first resolution will be i shall try not to feel jealous when i hear the other girls in school describing all the sick spells they've had goodness do you want to be sick demanded felix in astonishment it makes a person important explained sara ray i am going to try to improve my mind by reading good books and listening to older people wrote cecily you got that out of the sunday school paper cried felicity it doesn't matter where i got it said cecily with dignity the main thing is to keep it it's your turn felicity i said felicity tossed her beautiful golden head i told you i wasn't going to make any resolutions go on yourself i shall always study my grammar lesson i wrote i who loathed grammar with a deadly loathing i hate grammar too sighed sara ray it seems so unimportant sara was rather fond of a big word but did not always get hold of the right one i rather suspected that in the above instance she really meant uninteresting i won't get mad at felicity if i can help it wrote dan i'm sure i never do anything to make you mad exclaimed felicity i don't think it's polite to make resolutions about your sisters said peter he can't keep it anyway scoffed felicity he's got such an awful temper it's a family failing flashed dan breaking his resolution ere the ink on it was dry there you go taunted felicity i'll work all my arithmetic problems without any help scribbled felix i wish i could resolve that too sighed sara ray but it wouldn't be any use i'd never be able to do those compound multiplication sums the teacher gives us to do at home every night if i didn't get judy pineau to help me judy isn't a good reader and she can't spell at all but you can't stick her in arithmetic as far as she went herself i feel sure concluded poor sara in a hopeless tone that i'll never be able to understand compound multiplication multiplication is vexation division is as bad the rule of three perplexes me and fractions drive me mad quoted dan i haven't got as far as fractions yet sighed sara and i hope i'll be too big to go to school before i do i hate arithmetic but i am passionately fond of geography i will not play tit tat x on the fly leaves of my hymn book in church wrote peter mercy did you ever do such a thing exclaimed felicity in horror peter nodded shamefacedly yes that sunday mr bailey preached he was so long winded i got awful tired and anyway he was talking about things i couldn't understand so i played tit tat x with one of the markdale boys it was the day i was sitting up in the gallery well i hope if you ever do the like again you won't do it in our pew said felicity severely i ain't going to do it at all said peter i felt sort of mean all the rest of the day i shall try not to be vexed when people interrupt me when i'm telling stories wrote the story girl but it will be hard she added with a sigh i never mind being interrupted said felicity i shall try to be cheerful and smiling all the time wrote cecily you are anyway said sara ray loyally i don't believe we ought to be cheerful all the time said the story girl the bible says we ought to weep with those who weep but maybe it means that we're to weep cheerfully suggested cecily sorter as if you were thinking i'm very sorry for you but i'm mighty glad i'm not in the scrape too said dan dan don't be irreverent rebuked felicity i know a story about old mr and mrs davidson of markdale said the story girl she was always smiling and it used to aggravate her husband so one day he said very crossly old lady what are you grinning at oh well abiram everything's so bright and pleasant i've just got to smile not long after there came a time when everything went wrong the crop failed and their best cow died and mrs davidson had rheumatism and finally mr davidson fell and broke his leg but still mrs davidson smiled what in the dickens are you grinning about now old lady he demanded oh well abiram she said everything is so dark and unpleasant i've just got to smile well said the old man crossly i think you might give your face a rest sometimes i shall not talk gossip wrote sara ray with a satisfied air oh don't you think that's a little too strict asked cecily anxiously of course it's not right to talk mean gossip but the harmless kind doesn't hurt if i say to you that emmy macphail is going to get a new fur collar this winter that is harmless gossip but if i say i don't see how emmy macphail can afford a new fur collar when her father can't pay my father for the oats he got from him that would be mean gossip if i were you sara i'd put mean gossip sara consented to this amendment i will be polite to everybody was my third resolution which passed without comment i'll try not to use slang since cecily doesn't like it wrote dan i think some slang is real cute said felicity the family guide says it's very vulgar grinned dan doesn't it sara stanley don't disturb me said the story girl dreamily i'm just thinking a beautiful thought i've thought of a resolution to make cried felicity mr marwood"
