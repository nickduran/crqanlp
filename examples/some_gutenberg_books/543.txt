"1" "like it keeps you out and yet you have a chance to loaf in the office for a change i don't mean that way i mean it's such an opportunity for sympathy dr kennicott launched into a heavy oh these dutch farmers don't want sympathy all they need is a bath and a good dose of salts carol must have flinched for instantly he was urging what i mean is i don't want you to think i'm one of these old salts and quinine peddlers but i mean so many of my patients are husky farmers that i suppose i get kind of case hardened it seems to me that a doctor could transform a whole community if he wanted to if he saw it he's usually the only man in the neighborhood who has any scientific training isn't he yes that's so but i guess most of us get rusty we land in a rut of obstetrics and typhoid and busted legs what we need is women like you to jump on us it'd be you that would transform the town no i couldn't too flighty i did used to think about doing just that curiously enough but i seem to have drifted away from the idea oh i'm a fine one to be lecturing you no you're just the one you have ideas without having lost feminine charm say don't you think there's a lot of these women that go out for all these movements and so on that sacrifice after his remarks upon suffrage he abruptly questioned her about herself his kindliness and the firmness of his personality enveloped her and she accepted him as one who had a right to know what she thought and wore and ate and read he was positive he had grown from a sketched in stranger to a friend whose gossip was important news she noticed the healthy solidity of his chest his nose which had seemed irregular and large was suddenly virile she was jarred out of this serious sweetness when marbury bounced over to them and with horrible publicity yammered say what do you two think you're doing telling fortunes or making love let me warn you that the doc is a frisky bacheldore carol come on now folks shake a leg let's have some stunts or a dance or something she did not have another word with dr kennicott until their parting been a great pleasure to meet you miss milford may i see you some time when i come down again i'm here quite often taking patients to hospitals for majors and so on why what's your address you can ask mr marbury next time you come down if you really want to know want to know say you wait ii of the love making of carol and will kennicott there is nothing to be told which may not be heard on every summer evening on every shadowy block they were biology and mystery their speech was slang phrases and flares of poetry their silences were contentment or shaky crises when his arm took her shoulder all the beauty of youth first discovered when it is passing and all the commonplaceness of a well to do unmarried man encountering a pretty girl at the time when she is slightly weary of her employment and sees no glory ahead nor any man she is glad to serve they liked each other honestly they were both honest she was disappointed by his devotion to making money but she was sure that he did not lie to patients and that he did keep up with the medical magazines what aroused her to something more than liking was his boyishness when they went tramping they walked from st paul down the river to mendota kennicott more elastic seeming in a cap and a soft crepe shirt carol youthful in a tam o shanter of mole velvet a blue serge suit with an absurdly and agreeably broad turn down linen collar and frivolous ankles above athletic shoes the high bridge crosses the mississippi mounting from low banks to a palisade of cliffs far down beneath it on the st paul side upon mud flats is a wild settlement of chicken infested gardens and shanties patched together from discarded sign boards sheets of corrugated iron and planks fished out of the river carol leaned over the rail of the bridge to look down at this yang tse village in delicious imaginary fear she shrieked that she was dizzy with the height and it was an extremely human satisfaction to have a strong male snatch her back to safety instead of having a logical woman teacher or librarian sniff well if you're scared why don't you get away from the rail then from the cliffs across the river carol and kennicott looked back at st paul on its hills an imperial sweep from the dome of the cathedral to the dome of the state capitol the river road led past rocky field slopes deep glens woods flamboyant now with september to mendota white walls and a spire among trees beneath a hill old world in its placid ease and for this fresh land the place is ancient here is the bold stone house which general sibley the king of fur traders built in 1835 with plaster of river mud and ropes of twisted grass for laths it has an air of centuries in its solid rooms carol and kennicott found prints from other days which the house had seen tail coats of robin's egg blue clumsy red river carts laden with luxurious furs whiskered union soldiers in slant forage caps and rattling sabers it suggested to them a common american past and it was memorable because they had discovered it together they talked more trustingly more personally as they trudged on they crossed the minnesota river in a rowboat ferry they climbed the hill to the round stone tower of fort snelling they saw the junction of the mississippi and the minnesota and recalled the men who had come here eighty years ago maine lumbermen york traders soldiers from the maryland hills it's a good country and i'm proud of it let's make it all that those old boys dreamed about the unsentimental kennicott was moved to vow let's come on come to gopher prairie show us make the town well make it artistic it's mighty pretty but i'll admit we aren't any too darn artistic probably the lumber yard isn't as scrumptious as all these greek temples but go to it make us change i would like to some day now you'd love gopher prairie we've been doing a lot with lawns and gardening the past few years and it's so homey the big trees and and the best people on earth and keen i bet luke dawson carol but half listened to the names she could not fancy their ever becoming important to her i bet luke dawson has got more money than most of the swells on summit avenue and miss sherwin in the high school is a regular wonder reads latin like i do english and sam clark the hardware man he's a corker not a better man in the state to go hunting with and if you want culture besides vida sherwin there's reverend warren the congregational preacher and professor mott the superintendent of schools and guy pollock the lawyer they say he writes regular poetry and and raymie wutherspoon he's not such an awful boob when you get to know him and he sings swell and and there's plenty of others lym cass only of course none of them have your finesse you might call it but they don't make em any more appreciative and so on come on we're ready for you to boss us they sat on the bank below the parapet of the old fort hidden from observation he circled her shoulder with his arm relaxed after the walk a chill nipping her throat conscious of his warmth and power she leaned gratefully against him you know i'm in love with you carol she did not answer but she touched the back of his hand with an exploring finger you say i'm so darn materialistic how can i help it unless i have you to stir me up she did not answer she could not think you say a doctor could cure a town the way he does a person well you cure the town of whatever ails it if anything does and i'll be your surgical kit she did not follow his words only the burring resoluteness of them she was shocked thrilled as he kissed her cheek and cried there's no use saying things and saying things and saying things don't my arms talk to you now oh please please she wondered if she ought to be angry but it was a drifting thought and she discovered that she was crying then they were sitting six inches apart pretending that they had never been nearer while she tried to be impersonal i would like to would like to see gopher prairie trust me here she is brought some snapshots down to show you her cheek near his sleeve she studied a dozen village pictures they were streaky she saw only trees shrubbery a porch indistinct in leafy shadows but she exclaimed over the lakes dark water reflecting wooded bluffs a flight of ducks a fisherman in shirt sleeves and a wide straw hat holding up a string of croppies one winter picture of the edge of plover lake had the air of an etching lustrous slide of ice snow in the crevices of a boggy bank the mound of a muskrat house reeds in thin black lines arches of frosty grasses it was an impression of cool clear vigor how'd it be to skate there for a couple of hours or go zinging along on a fast ice boat and skip back home for coffee and some hot wienies he demanded it might be fun but here's the picture here's where you come in a photograph of a forest clearing pathetic new furrows straggling among stumps a clumsy log cabin chinked with mud and roofed with hay in front of it a sagging woman with tight drawn hair and a baby bedraggled smeary glorious eyed those are the kind of folks i practise among good share of the time nels erdstrom fine clean young svenska he'll have a corking farm in ten years but now i operated his wife on a kitchen table with my driver giving the anesthetic look at that scared baby needs some woman with hands like yours waiting for you just look at that baby's eyes look how he's begging don't they hurt me oh it would be sweet to help him so sweet as his arms moved toward her she answered all her doubts with sweet so sweet chapter iii under the rolling clouds of the prairie a moving mass of steel an irritable clank and rattle beneath a prolonged roar the sharp scent of oranges cutting the soggy smell of unbathed people and ancient baggage towns as planless as a scattering of pasteboard boxes on an attic floor the stretch of faded gold stubble broken only by clumps of willows encircling white houses and red barns no 7 the way train grumbling through minnesota imperceptibly climbing the giant tableland that slopes in a thousand mile rise from hot mississippi bottoms to the rockies it is september hot very dusty there is no smug pullman attached to the train and the day coaches of the east are replaced by free chair cars with each seat cut into two adjustable plush chairs the head rests covered with doubtful linen towels halfway down the car is a semi partition of carved oak columns but the aisle is of bare splintery grease blackened wood there is no porter no pillows no provision for beds but all today and all tonight they will ride in this long steel box farmers with perpetually tired wives and children who seem all to be of the same age workmen going to new jobs traveling salesmen with derbies and freshly shined shoes they are parched and cramped the lines of their hands filled with grime they go to sleep curled in distorted attitudes heads against the window panes or propped on rolled coats on seat arms and legs thrust into the aisle they do not read apparently they do not think they wait an early wrinkled young old mother moving as though her joints were dry opens a suit case in which are seen creased blouses a pair of slippers worn through at the toes a bottle of patent medicine a tin cup a paper covered book about dreams which the news butcher has coaxed her into buying she brings out a graham cracker which she feeds to a baby lying flat on a seat and wailing hopelessly most of the crumbs drop on the red plush of the seat and the woman sighs and tries to brush them away but they leap up impishly and fall back on the plush a soiled man and woman munch sandwiches and throw the crusts on the floor a large brick colored norwegian takes off his shoes grunts in relief and props his feet in their thick gray socks against the seat in front of him an old woman whose toothless mouth shuts like a mud turtle's and whose hair is not so much white as yellow like moldy linen with bands of pink skull apparent between the tresses anxiously lifts her bag opens it peers in closes it puts it under the seat and hastily picks it up and opens it and hides it all over again the bag is full of treasures and of memories a leather buckle an ancient band concert program scraps of ribbon lace satin in the aisle beside her is an extremely indignant parrakeet in a cage two facing seats overflowing with a slovene iron miner's family are littered with shoes dolls whisky bottles bundles wrapped in newspapers a sewing bag the oldest boy takes a mouth organ out of his coat pocket wipes the tobacco crumbs off and plays marching through georgia till every head in the car begins to ache the news butcher comes through selling chocolate bars and lemon drops a girl child ceaselessly trots down to the water cooler and back to her seat the stiff paper envelope which she uses for cup drips in the aisle as she goes and on each trip she stumbles over the feet of a carpenter who grunts ouch look out the dust caked doors are open and from the smoking car drifts back a visible blue line of stinging tobacco smoke and with it a crackle of laughter over the story which the young man in the bright blue suit and lavender tie and light yellow shoes has just told to the squat man in garage overalls the smell grows constantly thicker more stale ii to each of the passengers his seat was his temporary home and most of the passengers were slatternly housekeepers but one seat looked clean and deceptively cool in it were an obviously prosperous man and a black haired fine skinned girl whose pumps rested on an immaculate horsehide bag they were dr will kennicott and his bride carol they had been married at the end of a year of conversational courtship and they were on their way to gopher prairie after a wedding journey in the colorado mountains the hordes of the way train were not altogether new to carol she had seen them on trips from st paul to chicago but now that they had become her own people to bathe and encourage and adorn she had an acute and uncomfortable interest in them they distressed her they were so stolid she had always maintained that there is no american peasantry and she sought now to defend her faith by seeing imagination and enterprise in the young swedish farmers and in a traveling man working over his order blanks but the older people yankees as well as norwegians germans finns canucks had settled into submission to poverty they were peasants she groaned isn't there any way of waking them up what would happen if they understood scientific agriculture she begged of kennicott her hand groping for his it had been a transforming honeymoon she had been frightened to discover how tumultuous a feeling could be roused in her will had been lordly stalwart jolly impressively competent in making camp tender and understanding through the hours when they had lain side by side in a tent pitched among pines high up on a lonely mountain spur his hand swallowed hers as he started from thoughts of the practise to which he was returning these people wake em up what for they're happy but they're so provincial no that isn't what i mean they're oh so sunk in the mud look here carrie you want to get over your city idea that because a man's pants aren't pressed he's a fool these farmers are mighty keen and up and coming i know that's what hurts life seems so hard for them these lonely farms and this gritty train oh they don't mind it besides things are changing the auto the telephone rural free delivery they're bringing the farmers in closer touch with the town takes time you know to change a wilderness like this was fifty years ago but already why they can hop into the ford or the overland and get in to the movies on saturday evening quicker than you could get down to em by trolley in st paul but if it's these towns we've been passing that the farmers run to for relief from their bleakness can't you understand just look at them kennicott was amazed ever since childhood he had seen these towns from trains on this same line he grumbled why what's the matter with em good hustling burgs it would astonish you to know how much wheat and rye and corn and potatoes they ship in a year but they're so ugly i'll admit they aren't comfy like gopher prairie but give em time what's the use of giving them time unless some one has desire and training enough to plan them hundreds of factories trying to make attractive motor cars but these towns left to chance no that can't be true it must have taken genius to make them so scrawny oh they're not so bad was all he answered he pretended that his hand was the cat and hers the mouse for the first time she tolerated him rather than encouraged him she was staring out at schoenstrom a hamlet of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants at which the train was stopping a bearded german and his pucker mouthed wife tugged their enormous imitation leather satchel from under a seat and waddled out the station agent hoisted a dead calf aboard the baggage car there were no other visible activities in schoenstrom in the quiet of the halt carol could hear a horse kicking his stall a carpenter shingling a roof the business center of schoenstrom took up one side of one block facing the railroad it was a row of one story shops covered with galvanized iron or with clapboards painted red and bilious yellow the buildings were as ill assorted as temporary looking as a mining camp street in the motion pictures the railroad station was a one room frame box a mirey cattle pen on one side and a crimson wheat elevator on the other the elevator with its cupola on the ridge of a shingled roof resembled a broad shouldered man with a small vicious pointed head the only habitable structures to be seen were the florid red brick catholic church and rectory at the end of main street carol picked at kennicott's sleeve you wouldn't call this a not so bad town would you these dutch burgs are kind of slow still at that see that fellow coming out of the general store there getting into the big car i met him once he owns about half the town besides the store rauskukle his name is he owns a lot of mortgages and he gambles in farm lands good nut on him that fellow why they say he's worth three or four hundred thousand dollars got a dandy great big yellow brick house with tiled walks and a garden and everything other end of town can't see it from here i've gone past it when i've driven through here yes sir then if he has all that there's no excuse whatever for this place if his three hundred thousand went back into the town where it belongs they could burn up these shacks and build a dream village a jewel why do the farmers and the town people let the baron keep it i must say i don't quite get you sometimes carrie let him they can't help themselves he's a dumm old dutchman and probably the priest can twist him around his finger but when it comes to picking good farming land he's a regular wiz i see he's their symbol of beauty the town erects him instead of erecting buildings honestly don't know what you're driving at you're kind of played out after this long trip you'll feel better when you get home and have a good bath and put on the blue negligee that's some vampire costume you witch he squeezed her arm looked at her knowingly they moved on from the desert stillness of the schoenstrom station the train creaked banged swayed the air was nauseatingly thick kennicott turned her face from the window rested her head on his shoulder she was coaxed from her unhappy mood but she came out of it unwillingly and when kennicott was satisfied that he had corrected all her worries and had opened a magazine of saffron detective stories she sat upright here she meditated is the newest empire of the world the northern middlewest a land of dairy herds and exquisite lakes of new automobiles and tar paper shanties and silos like red towers of clumsy speech and a hope that is boundless an empire which feeds a quarter of the world yet its work is merely begun they are pioneers these sweaty wayfarers for all their telephones and bank accounts and automatic pianos and co operative leagues and for all its fat richness theirs is a pioneer land what is its future she wondered a future of cities and factory smut where now are loping empty fields homes universal and secure or placid chateaux ringed with sullen huts youth free to find knowledge and laughter willingness to sift the sanctified lies or creamy skinned fat women smeared with grease and chalk gorgeous in the skins of beasts and the bloody feathers of slain birds playing bridge with puffy pink nailed jeweled fingers women who after much expenditure of labor and bad temper still grotesquely resemble their own flatulent lap dogs the ancient stale inequalities or something different in history unlike the tedious maturity of other empires what future and what hope carol's head ached with the riddle she saw the prairie flat in giant patches or rolling in long hummocks the width and bigness of it which had expanded her spirit an hour ago began to frighten her it spread out so it went on so uncontrollably she could never know it kennicott was closeted in his detective story with the loneliness which comes most depressingly in the midst of many people she tried to forget problems to look at the prairie objectively the grass beside the railroad had been burnt over it was a smudge prickly with charred stalks of weeds beyond the undeviating barbed wire fences were clumps of golden rod only this thin hedge shut them off from the plains shorn wheat lands of autumn a hundred acres to a field prickly and gray near by but in the blurred distance like tawny velvet stretched over dipping hillocks the long rows of wheat shocks marched like soldiers in worn yellow tabards the newly plowed fields were black banners fallen on the distant slope it was a martial immensity vigorous a little harsh unsoftened by kindly gardens the expanse was relieved by clumps of oaks with patches of short wild grass and every mile or two was a chain of cobalt slews with the flicker of blackbirds wings across them all this working land was turned into exuberance by the light the sunshine was dizzy on open stubble shadows from immense cumulus clouds were forever sliding across low mounds and the sky was wider and loftier and more resolutely blue than the sky of cities she declared it's a glorious country a land to be big in she crooned then kennicott startled her by chuckling d you realize the town after the next is gopher prairie home iii that one word home it terrified her had she really bound herself to live inescapably in this town called gopher prairie and this thick man beside her who dared to define her future he was a stranger she turned in her seat stared at him who was he why was he sitting with her he wasn't of her kind his neck was heavy his speech was heavy he was twelve or thirteen years older than she and about him was none of the magic of shared adventures and eagerness she could not believe that she had ever slept in his arms that was one of the dreams which you had but did not officially admit she told herself how good he was how dependable and understanding she touched his ear smoothed the plane of his solid jaw and turning away again concentrated upon liking his town it wouldn't be like these barren settlements it couldn't be why it had three thousand population that was a great many people there would be six hundred houses or more and the lakes near it would be so lovely she'd seen them in the photographs they had looked charming hadn't they as the train left wahkeenyan she began nervously to watch for the lakes the entrance to all her future life but when she discovered them to the left of the track her only impression of them was that they resembled the photographs a mile from gopher prairie the track mounts a curving low ridge and she could see the town as a whole with a passionate jerk she pushed up the window looked out the arched fingers of her left hand trembling on the sill her right hand at her breast and she saw that gopher prairie was merely an enlargement of all the hamlets which they had been passing only to the eyes of a kennicott was it exceptional the huddled low wooden houses broke the plains scarcely more than would a hazel thicket the fields swept up to it past it it was unprotected and unprotecting there was no dignity in it nor any hope of greatness only the tall red grain elevator and a few tinny church steeples rose from the mass it was a frontier camp it was not a place to live in not possibly not conceivably the people they'd be as drab as their houses as flat as their fields she couldn't stay here she would have to wrench loose from this man and flee she peeped at him she was at once helpless before his mature fixity and touched by his excitement as he sent his magazine skittering along the aisle stooped for their bags came up with flushed face and gloated here we are she smiled loyally and looked away the train was entering town the houses on the outskirts were dusky old red mansions with wooden frills or gaunt frame shelters like grocery boxes or new bungalows with concrete foundations imitating stone now the train was passing the elevator the grim storage tanks for oil a creamery a lumber yard a stock yard muddy and trampled and stinking now they were stopping at a squat red frame station the platform crowded with unshaven farmers and with loafers unadventurous people with dead eyes she was here she could not go on it was the end the end of the world she sat with closed eyes longing to push past kennicott hide somewhere in the train flee on toward the pacific something large arose in her soul and commanded stop it stop being a whining baby she stood up quickly she said isn't it wonderful to be here at last he trusted her so she would make herself like the place and she was going to do tremendous things she followed kennicott and the bobbing ends of the two bags which he carried they were held back by the slow line of disembarking passengers she reminded herself that she was actually at the dramatic moment of the bride's home coming she ought to feel exalted she felt nothing at all except irritation at their slow progress toward the door kennicott stooped to peer through the windows he shyly exulted look look there's a bunch come down to welcome us sam clark and the missus and dave dyer and jack elder and yes sir harry haydock and juanita and a whole crowd i guess they see us now yuh yuh sure they see us see em waving she obediently bent her head to look out at them she had hold of herself she was ready to love them but she was embarrassed by the heartiness of the cheering group from the vestibule she waved to them but she clung a second to the sleeve of the brakeman who helped"
