"1" "undoubtedly you are a stranger said the friendly youth eyeing me from top to toe with renewed wonder and by your unknown garb one from afar from how far no man can say not even i but from very far in truth let that stay your curiosity for the time and now to bench and ale mug on good fellow the shortest way i was never so thirsty as this since our water butts went overboard when i sailed the southern seas as a tramp apprentice and for three days we had to damp our black tongues with the puddles the night dews left in the lift of our mainsail without more words being a little awed of me i thought the boy led me through the good humoured crowd to where facing the main road to the town but a little sheltered by a thicket of trees covered with gigantic pink blossoms stood a drinking place a cluster of tables set round an open grass plot here he brought me a platter of some light inefficient cakes which merely served to make hunger more self conscious and some fine aromatic wine contained in a triple bodied flask each division containing vintage of a separate hue we broke our biscuits sipped that mysterious wine and talked of many things until at last something set us on the subject of astronomy a study i found my dapper gallant had some knowledge of which was not to be wondered at seeing he dwelt under skies each night set thick above his curly head with tawny planets and glittering constellations sprinkled through space like flowers in may meadows he knew what worlds went round the sun larger or lesser and seeing this i began to question him for i was uneasy in my innermost mind and you will remember so far had no certain knowledge of where i was only a dim restless suspicion that i had come beyond the ken of all men's knowledge therefore sweeping clear the board with my sleeve and breaking the wafer cake i was eating i set down one central piece for the sun and see here i said good fellow this morsel shall stand for that sun you have just been welcoming back with quaint ritual now stretch your starry knowledge to the utmost and put down that tankard for a moment if this be yonder sun and this lesser crumb be the outermost one of our revolving system and this the next within and this the next and so on now if this be so tell me which of these fragmentary orbs is ours which of all these crumbs from the hand of the primordial would be that we stand upon and i waited with an anxiety a light manner thinly hid to hear his answer it came at once laughing as though the question were too trivial and more to humour my wayward fancy than aught else that boy circled his rosy thumb about a minute and brought it down on the planet mars i started and stared at him then all of a tremble cried you trifle with me choose again there see i will set the symbols and name them to you anew there now on your soul tell me truly which this planet is the one here at our feet and again the boy shook his head wondering at my eagerness and pointed to mars saying gently as he did so the fact was certain as the day above us nothing was marvellous but my questioning mars oh dreadful tremendous unexpected with a cry of affright and bringing my fist down on the table till all the cups upon it leapt i told him he lied lied like a simpleton whose astronomy was as rotten as his wit smote the table and scowled at him for a spell then turned away and let my chin fall upon my breast and my hands upon my lap and yet and yet it might be so everything about me was new and strange the crisp thin air i breathed was new the lukewarm sunshine new the sleek long ivory faces of the people new yesterday was it yesterday i was back there away in a world that pines to know of other worlds and one fantastic wish of mine backed by a hideous infernal chance had swung back the doors of space and shot me if that boy spoke true into the outer void where never living man had been before all my wits about me all the horrible bathos of my earthly clothing on me all my terrestrial hungers in my veins i sprang to my feet and swept my hands across my eyes was that a dream or this no no both were too real the hum of my faraway city still rang in my ears a swift vision of the girl i had loved of the men i had hated of the things i had hoped for rose before me still dazing my inner eye and these about me were real people too it was real earth real skies trees and rocks had the infernal gods indeed heard i asked myself the foolish wish that started from my lips in a moment of fierce discontent and swept me into another sphere another existence i looked at the boy as though he could answer that question but there was nothing in his face but vacuous wonder i clapped my hands together and beat my breast it was true my soul within me said it was true the boy had not lied the djins had heard i was just in the flesh i had my common human hungers still unsatisfied where never mortal man had hungered before and scarcely knowing whether i feared or not whether to laugh or cry but with all the wonder and terror of that great remove sweeping suddenly upon me i staggered back to my seat and dropping my arms upon the table leant my head heavily upon them and strove to choke back the passion which beset me chapter iii it was the light touch of the boy an upon my shoulder which roused me he was bending down his pretty face full of concernful sympathy and in a minute said knowing nothing of my thoughts of course it is the wine stranger the pink oblivion it sometimes makes one feel like that until enough is taken you stopped just short of what you should have had and the next cup would have been delight i should have told you ay i answered glad he should think so it was the wine no doubt your quaint drink sir tangled up my senses for the moment but they are clearer now and i am eager past expression to learn a little more of this strange country i have wandered into i would rather said the boy relapsing again into his state of kindly lethargy that you learnt things as you went for talking is work and work we hate but today we are all new and fresh and if ever you are to ask questions now is certainly the time come with me to the city yonder and as we go i will answer the things you wish to know and i went with him for i was humble and amazed and in truth at that moment had not a word to say for myself all the way from the plain where i had awoke to the walls of the city stood booths drinking places and gardens divided by labyrinths of canals and embowered in shrubberies that seemed coming into leaf and flower as we looked so swift was the process of their growth these waterways were covered with skiffs being pushed and rowed in every direction the cheerful rowers calling to each other through the leafy screens separating one lane from another till the place was full of their happy chirruping every booth and way side halting place was thronged with these delicate and sprightly people so friendly so gracious and withal so purposeless i began to think we should never reach the town itself for first my guide would sit down on a green stream bank his feet a dangle in the clear water and bandy wit with a passing boat as though there were nothing else in the world to think of and when i dragged him out of that whispering in his ear the town my dear boy the town i am all agape to see it he would saunter reluctantly to a booth a hundred yards further on and fall to eating strange confections or sipping coloured wines with chance acquaintances till again i plucked him by the sleeve and said seth good comrade was it not so you called your city just now take me to the gates and i will be grateful to you then on again down a flowery lane aimless and happy wasting my time and his with placid civility i was led by that simple guide wherever we went the people stared at me as well they might as i walked through them overtopping the tallest by a head or more the drinking cups paused half way to their mouths the jests died away upon their lips and the blinking eyes of the drinkers shone with a momentary sparkle of wonder as their minds reeled down those many tinted floods to the realms of oblivion they loved i heard men whisper one to another who is he whence does he come is he a tribute taker as i strolled amongst them my mind still so thrilled with doubt and wonder that to me they seemed hardly more than painted puppets the vistas of their lovely glades and the ivory town beyond only the fancy of a dream and their talk as incontinent as the babble of a stream then happily as i walked along with bent head brooding over the incredible thing that had happened my companion's shapely legs gave out and with a sigh of fatigue he suggested we should take a skiff amongst the many lying about upon the margins and sail towards the town for said he the breeze blows thitherward and tis a shame to use one's limbs when nature will carry us for nothing but have you a boat of your own hereabouts i queried for to tell the truth i came from home myself somewhat poorly provided with means to buy or barter and if your purse be not heavier than mine we must still do as poor men do oh said an there is no need to think of that no one here to hire or hire of we will just take the first skiff we see that suits us and what if the owner should come along and find his boat gone why what should he do but take the next along the bank and the master of that the next again how else could it be said the martian and shrugging my shoulders for i was in no great mood to argue we went down to the waterway through a thicket of budding trees underlaid with a carpet of small red flowers filling the air with a scent of honey and soon found a diminutive craft pulled up on the bank there were some dainty cloaks and wraps in it which an took out and laid under a tree but first he felt in the pouch of one for a sweetmeat which his fine nostrils acute as a squirrel's told him was there and taking the lump out bit a piece from it afterwards replacing it in the owner's pocket with the frankest simplicity then we pushed off hoisted the slender mast set the smallest lug sail that ever a sailor smiled at and myself at the helm and that golden youth amidships away we drifted under thickets of drooping canes tasselled with yellow catkin flowers up the blue alley of the water into the broader open river beyond with its rapid flow and crowding boats the white city front now towering clear before us the air was full of sunshine and merry voices birds were singing trees were budding only my heart was heavy my mind confused yet why should i be sad i said to myself presently life beat in my pulses what had i to fear this world i had tumbled into was new and strange no doubt but tomorrow it would be old and familiar it discredited my manhood to sit brow bent like that so with an effort i roused myself old chap i said to my companion as he sat astride of a thwart slowly chewing something sticky and eyeing me out of the corner of his eyes with vapid wonder tell me something of this land of yours or something about yourself which reminds me i have a question to ask it is a bit delicate but you look a sensible sort of fellow and will take no offence the fact is i have noticed as we came along half your population dresses in all the colours of the rainbow fancy suitings our tailors could call it at home and this half of the census are undoubtedly men and women the rub is that the other half to which you belong all dress alike in yellow and i will be fired from the biggest gun on the carolina's main deck if i can tell what sex you belong to i took you for a boy in the beginning and the way you closed with the idea of having a drink with me seemed to show i was dead on the right course then a little later on i heard you and a friend abusing our sex from an outside point of view in a way which was very disconcerting this and some other things have set me all abroad again and as fate seems determined to make us chums for this voyage why well frankly i should be glad to know if you be boy or girl if you are as i am no more nor less then for i like you there's my hand in comradeship if you are otherwise as those sleek outlines seem to promise why here's my hand again but man or woman you must be come which is it if i had been perplexed before to watch that boy now was more curious than ever he drew back from me with a show of wounded dignity then bit his lips and sighed and stared and frowned come i said laughingly speak it engenders ambiguity to be so ambiguous of gender tis no great matter yes or no a plain answer will set us fairly in our friendship if it is comrade then comrade let it be if maid why i shall not quarrel with that though it cost me a likely messmate you mock me not i i never mocked any one and does my robe tell you nothing nothing so much a yellow tunic and becoming enough but nothing about it to hang a deduction on come are you a girl after all i do not count myself a girl why then you are the most blooming boy that ever eyes were set upon and though tis with some tinge of regret yet cheerfully i welcome you into the ranks of manhood i hate your manhood send it after the maidhood it fits me just as badly but an be reasonable man or maid you must be must be why why was ever such a question put to a sane mortal before i stared at that ambiguous thing before me and then a little wroth to be played with growled out something about martians being all drunk or mad tis you yourself are one or other said that individual by this time pink with anger and if you think because i am what i am you can safely taunt me you are wrong see i have a sting and like a thwarted child my companion half drew from the folds of the yellow tunic dress the daintiest most harmless looking little dagger that was ever seen oh if it comes to that i answered touching the navy scabbard still at my hip and regaining my temper at the sight of hers why i have a sting also and twice as long as yours but in truth an let us not talk of these things if something in what i have said has offended nice martian scruples i am sorry and will question no more leaving my wonder for time to settle no said the other it was my fault to be hasty of offence i am not so angered once a year but in truth your question moves us yellow robes deeply did you not really know that we who wear this saffron tunic are slaves a race apart despised by all slaves no how should i know it i thought you must understand a thing so fundamental and it was that thought which made your questions seem unkind but if indeed you have come so far as not to understand even this then let me tell you once we of this garb were women priestesses of the immaculate conceptions of humanity guardians of those great hopes and longings which die so easily and because we forgot our high station and took to aping another sex the gods deserted and men despised us giving us in the fierceness of their contempt what we asked for we are the slave ants of the nest the work bees of the hive come in truth of those here who still be men and women of a sort but toilers only unknown in love unregretted in death those who dangle all children but their own slaves cursed with the accomplishment of their own ambition there was no doubt poor an believed what she said for her attitude was one of extreme dejection while she spoke and to cheer her i laughed oh come it can't be as bad as that surely sometimes some of you win back to womanhood you yourself do not look so far gone but what some deed of abnegation some strong love if you could but conceive it would set you right again surely you of the primrose robes can sometimes love whereat unwittingly i troubled the waters in the placid soul of that outcast martian i cannot exactly describe how it was but she bent her head silently for a moment or two and then with a sigh lifting her eyes suddenly to mine said quietly yes sometimes sometimes but very seldom while for an instant across her face there flashed the summer lightning of a new hope a single transient glance of wistful timid entreaty of wonder and delight that dared not even yet acknowledge itself then it was my turn to sit silent and the pause was so awkward that in a minute to break it i exclaimed let's drop personalities old chap i mean my dear miss an tell me something about your people and let us begin properly at the top have you got a king for instance to this the girl pulling herself out of the pleasant slough of her listlessness and falling into my vein answered both yes and no sir traveller from afar no chiefly and yet perhaps yes if it were no then it were so and if yes then hath were our king a mild king i should judge by your uncertainty in the place where i came from kings press their individualities somewhat more clearly on their subjects minds is hath here in the city does he come to your feasts today an nodded hath was on the river he had been to see the sunrise even now she thought the laughter and singing down behind the bend might be the king's barge coming up citywards he will not be late said my companion because the marriage feast is set for tomorrow in the palace i became interested kings palaces marriage feasts why here was something substantial to go upon after all these gauzy folk might turn out good fellows jolly comrades to sojourn amongst and marriage feasts reminded me again i was hungry who is it i asked with more interest in my tone who gets married is it your ambiguous king himself whereat an's purple eyes broadened with wonder then as though she would not be uncivil she checked herself and answered with smothered pity for my ignorance not only hath himself but every one stranger they are all married tomorrow you would not have them married one at a time would you this with inexpressible derision i said with humility something like that happened in the place i came from asking her how it chanced the convenience of so many came to one climax at the same moment surely an this is a marvel of arrangement where i dwelt wooings would sometimes be long or sometimes short and all maids were not complacent by such universal agreement the girl was clearly perplexed she stared at me a space then said what have wooings long or short to do with weddings you talk as if you did your wooing first and then came to marriage we get married first and woo afterwards tis not a bad idea and i can see it might lend an ease and certainty to the pastime which our method lacks but if the woman is got first and sued subsequently who brings you together who sees to the essential preliminaries of assortment an looking at my shoes as though she speculated on the remoteness of the journey i had come if it were measured by my ignorance replied the urn stranger the urn does that what else how it may be in that out fashioned region you have come from i cannot tell but here tis so commonplace i should have thought you must have known it we put each new year the names of all womenkind into an urn and the men draw for them each town each village by itself and those they draw are theirs is it conceivable your race has other methods i told her it was so we picked and chose for ourselves beseeching the damsels fighting for them and holding the sun of romance was at its setting just where the martians held it to rise whereat an burst out laughing a clear ringing laugh that set all the light hearted folk in the nearest boats laughing in sympathy but when the grotesqueness of the idea had somewhat worn off she turned grave and asked me if such a fancy did not lead to spite envy and bickerings why it seems to me she said shaking her curly head such a plan might fire cities desolate plains and empty palaces such things have been ah our way is much the better see quoth that gentle philosopher here one of our women would say am i to day unwed as free of thought as yonder bird chasing the catkin down tomorrow i shall be married with a whole summer to make love in relieved at one bound of all those uncertainties you acknowledge to with nothing to do but lie about on sunny banks with him whom chance sends me come to the goal of love without any travelling to get there why you must acknowledge this is the perfection of ease but supposing i said chance dealt unkindly to you from your nuptial urn supposing the man was not to your liking or another coveted him to which an answered with some shrewdness in the first case we should do what we might being no worse off than those in your land who had played ill providence to themselves in the second no maid would covet him whom fate had given to another it were too fatiguing or if such a thing did happen then one of them would waive his claims for no man or woman ever born was worth a wrangle and it is allowed us to barter and change a little all this was strange enough i could not but laugh while an laughed at the lightest invitation and thus chatting and deriding each other's social arrangements we floated idly townwards and presently came out into the main waterway perhaps a mile wide and flowing rapidly as streams will on the threshold of the spring with brash or waste of distant beaches riding down it and every now and then a broken branch or tree stem glancing through waves whose crests a fresh wind lifted and sowed in golden showers in the intervening furrows the martians seemed expert upon the water steering nimbly between these floating dangers when they met them but for the most part hugging the shore where a more placid stream better suited their fancies and for a time all went well an as we went along was telling me more of her strange country pointing out birds or flowers and naming them to me now that she said pointing to a small grey owl who sat reflective on a floating log we were approaching that is a bird of omen cover your face and look away for it is not well to watch it whereat i laughed oh i answered so those ancient follies have come as far as this have they but it is no bird grey or black or white that can frighten folk where i come from see i will ruffle his philosophy for him and suiting the action to the words i lifted a pebble that happened to lie at the bottom of the boat and flung it at that creature with the melancholy eyes away went the owl dipping his wings into the water at every stroke and as he went wailing out a ghostly cry which even amongst sunshine and glitter made one's flesh creep an shook her head you should not have done that she said our dead whom we send down over the falls come back in the body of yonder little bird but he has gone now she added with relief see he settles far up stream upon the point of yonder rotten bough i would not disturb him again if i were you whatever more an would have said was lost for amidst a sound of flutes and singing round the bend of the river below came a crowd of boats decked with flowers and garlands all clustering round a barge barely able to move so thick those lesser skiffs pressed upon it so close those wherries hung about that the garlanded rowers who sat at the oars could scarcely pull but here as everywhere it was the same good temper the same carelessness of order as like a flowery island in the dancing blue water the motley fleet came up i steered our skiff a space out from the bank to get a better view while an clapped her hands together and laughed it is hath he himself and those of the palace with him steer a little nearer still friend so between yon floating rubbish flats for those with hath are good to look at nothing loth i made out into mid stream to see that strange prince go by little thinking in a few minutes i should be shaking hands with him a wet and dripping hero the crowd came up and having the advantage of the wind it did not take me long to get a front place in the ruck whence i set to work with republican interest in royalty to stare at the man who an said was the head of martian society he did not make me desire to renounce my democratic principles the royal fellow was sitting in the centre of the barge under a canopy and on a throne which was a mass of flowers not bunched together as they would have been with us but so cunningly arranged that they rose from the footstool to the pinnacle in a rhythm of colour a poem in bud and petals the like of which for harmonious beauty i could not have imagined possible and in this fairy den was a thin gaunt young man dressed in some sort of black stuff so nondescript that it amounted to little more than a shadow i took it for granted that a substance of bone and muscle was covered by that gloomy suit but it was the face above that alone riveted my gaze and made me return the stare he gave me as we came up with redoubled interest it was not an unhandsome face but ashy grey in colour and amongst the insipid countenances of the martians about him marvellously thoughtful i do not know whether those who had killed themselves by learning ever leave ghosts behind but if so this was the very ideal for such a one at his feet i noticed when i unhooked my eyes from his at last sat a girl in a loose coral pink gown who was his very antipode princess heru for so she was called was resting one arm upon his knee at our approach and pulling a blue convolvulus bud to pieces a charming picture of dainty idleness anything so soft so silken as that little lady was never seen before who am i a poor quarter deck loafer that i should attempt to describe what poet and painter alike would have failed to realise i know of course your stock descriptives the melting eye the coral lip the peachy cheek the raven tress but these were coined for mortal woman and this was not one of them i"
