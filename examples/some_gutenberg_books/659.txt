"1" "were around him among them was mike who was just on the point of buying another package as before he put it in his pocket and it was not till teddy asked what luck mike that he drew it out and opening it again produced fifty cents it's the big prize he said sure i'm in luck anyhow you're the boy that's lucky said teddy with a grin as paul witnessed the scene a light broke upon him now he understood how teddy could afford to give such large prizes mike and the other boy jim were only confederates of his decoy ducks who kept drawing over again the same prize which was eventually given back to teddy it was plain now why mike put the package into his pocket before opening it it was to exchange it for another packet into which the money had previously been placed but which was supposed by the lookers on to be the same that had just been purchased the prize could afterward be placed in a new packet and used over again that ain't the same package said paul announcing his discovery he had it all the while in his pocket look here blustered mike you jest mind your own business that's the best thing for you suppose i don't if you don't there may be a funeral to morrow of a boy about your size there was a laugh at paul's expense but he took it coolly i'll send you a particular invitation to attend if i can get anybody to go over to the island as mike had been a resident at blackwell's island on two different occasions this produced a laugh at his expense in the midst of which paul walked off chapter iv teddy gives up business have you sold all your packages paul asked jimmy as our hero entered the humble room where the table was already spread with a simple dinner no said paul i only sold twenty i begin to think that the prize package business will soon be played out why there's too many that'll go into it here paul related his experience of the morning explaining how it was that teddy had managed to distance him in the competition can't you do the same paul asked jimmy mother's got a gold dollar she could lend you that might do said paul but i don't know any boy i could trust to draw it except you and some of them would know we were brothers i think paul that would be dishonest said mrs hoffman i would rather make less if i were you and do it honestly maybe you're right mother i'll try it again this afternoon keeping as far away from teddy as i can if i find i can't make it go i'll try some other business jimmy have you shown paul your drawing said his mother here it is paul said jimmy producing his drawing book from which he had copied a simple design of a rustic cottage why that's capital jimmy said paul in real surprise i had no idea you would succeed so well do you really think so paul asked the little boy much pleased i really do how long did it take you only a short time not more than half an hour i should think said mrs hoffman i think jimmy succeeded very well you'll make a great artist some time jimmy said paul i wish i could said the little boy i should like to earn some money so that you and mother need not work so hard hard work agrees with me i'm tough said paul but when we get to be men jimmy we'll make so much money that mother needn't work at all she shall sit in the parlor all day dressed in silk with nothing to do i don't think i would enjoy that said mrs hoffman smiling will you be in the candy business then paul said jimmy no jimmy it would never do for the brother of a great artist to be selling candy round the streets i hope i shall have something better to do than that sit down to dinner paul said his mother it's all ready the dinner was not a luxurious one there was a small plate of cold meat some potatoes and bread and butter but mrs hoffman felt glad to be able to provide even that and paul who had the hearty appetite of a growing boy did full justice to the fare they had scarcely finished when a knock was heard at the door paul answering the summons admitted a stout pleasant looking irishwoman the top of the mornin to ye mrs donovan said paul bowing ceremoniously ah ye'll be afther havin your joke paul said mrs donovan good naturedly and how is your health mum the day i am well thank you mrs donovan said mrs hoffman sit down to the table won't you we're just through dinner but there's something left thank you mum i've jist taken dinner i was goin to wash this

my fingers is too coarse belike thank you mrs donovan on those terms i will agree to your kind offer washing is a little hard for me mrs hoffman collected a few pieces and wrapping them up in a handkerchief handed them to her guest and now what have you been doin jimmy darlint said mrs donovan turning her broad good humored face toward the younger boy i've been drawing a picture said jimmy would you like to see it now isn't that illigant exclaimed mrs donovan admiringly taking the picture and gazing at it with rapt admiration who showed you how to do it paul bought me a book and i copied it out of that you're a rale genius maybe you'll make pictures some time like them we have in the church of the blessed virgin and the saints do you think you could draw me now she asked with curiosity i haven't got a piece of paper big enough said jimmy slyly ah it's pokin fun at me ye are said mrs donovan good humoredly just like my pat he run into the room yesterday sayin mother there's great news barnum's fat woman is dead and he's comin afther you this afternoon he'll pay you ten dollars a week and board whist ye spalpeen said i is it makin fun of your poor mother ye are but i

donovan i'll jist bring it in meself when it's ready she is very kind said mrs hoffman when bridget donovan had gone i shall be glad to have her wash i am apt to feel weak after it what are you going to do this afternoon paul i'll try to sell out the rest of my stock of packages perhaps i shan't succeed but i'll do my best shall you have another picture to show me when i come back tonight jimmy yes paul i love to draw i'm going to try this castle it's rather hard isn't it i can do it said jimmy confidently paul left the room with his basket on his arm he was drawn by curiosity to the spot where he had met with his first success as well as his first failure the front of the post office here he became witness to an unexpectedly lively scene in other words a fight in which teddy o'brien and his confederate mike were the contestants to explain the cause of the quarrel it must be stated that it related to a division of the spoils teddy had sold out his last package seventy five in number for these he had received five cents apiece making in all three dollars and seventy five cents of which all but a dollar and seventy five cents representing the value of the prizes and the original cost of the packages and their contents was profit now according to the arrangement entered into between him and mike the latter for his services was to receive one cent on every package sold this however seemed to teddy too much to pay so when the time of reckoning came he stoutly asseverated that there were but sixty packages that don't go down said mike indignantly it's nearer a hundred no it isn't it's only sixty you've got the fifty cents and i'll give you ten more you must give me the whole sixty then said mike changing his ground i drawed the fifty as a prize teddy was struck with astonishment at the impudence of this assumption it wasn't no prize he said yes it was said mike you said so yourself didn't he jim jim who was also a confederate but had agreed to accept twenty five cents in full for services rendered promptly answered shure mike's right it was a prize he drew you want to chate me said teddy angrily what have you been doin all the mornin demanded mike you're the chap to talk about chatin ain't you i'll give you twenty five cents said teddy and that's all i will give you then you've got to fight said mike squaring off yes you've got to fight chimed in jim who thought he saw a chance for more money teddy looked at his two enemies each of whom was probably more than a match for himself and was not long in deciding that his best course was to avoid a fight by running accordingly he tucked all the money into his pocket and turning incontinently fled down liberty street closely pursued by his late confederates paul came up just in time to hear the termination of the dispute and watch the flight of his late business rival i guess teddy won't go into the business again he reflected i may as well take my old stand accordingly he once more installed himself on the post office steps and began to cry prize packages only five cents having no competitor now to interfere with his trade he met with fair success and by four o'clock was able to start for home with his empty basket having disposed of all his stock in trade his profits though not so great as the day before amounted to a dollar if i could only make a dollar every day thought paul i would be satisfied chapter v paul loses his basket paul continued in the prize package business for three weeks his success varied but he never made less than seventy five cents a day and sometimes as much as a dollar and a quarter he was not without competitors more than once on reaching his accustomed stand he found a rival occupying it before him in such cases he quietly passed on and set up his business elsewhere preferring to monopolize the trade though the location might not be so good teddy o'brien did not again enter the field we left him at the end of the last chapter trying to escape from mike and jim who demanded a larger sum than he was willing to pay for their services he succeeded in escaping with his money but the next day the two confederates caught him and teddy received a black eye as a receipt in full of all demands so on the whole he decided that some other business would suit him better and resumed the blacking box which he had abandoned on embarking in commercial pursuits mike donovan and jim parker were two notoriously bad boys preferring to make a living in any other way than by honest industry as some of these ways were not regarded as honest in the sight of the law each had more than once been sentenced to a term at blackwell's island they made a proposition to paul to act as decoy ducks for him in the same way as for teddy he liked neither of the boys and did not care to be associated with them this refusal mike and jim resented and determined to pay off paul if they ever got a chance our hero from time to time saw them hovering about him but took very little notice of them he knew that he was a match for either though mike exceeded him in size and he felt quite capable of taking care of himself one day mike and jim whose kindred tastes led them to keep company met at the corner of liberty and william streets mike looked unusually dilapidated he had had a scuffle the day before with another boy and his clothes always well ventilated got torn in several extra places as it was very uncertain when he would be in a financial condition to provide himself with another suit the prospect was rather alarming jim parker looked a shade more respectable in attire but his face and hands were streaked with blacking to this however jim had become so accustomed that he would probably have felt uncomfortable with a clean face how are you off for stamps jim asked mike dead broke was the reply so am i i ain't had no breakfast nor i cept an apple couldn't i eat though suppose we borrow a quarter of paul hoffman he wouldn't lend a feller not if he knowed it said mike significantly what do you mean mike asked jim with some curiosity we'll borrow without leave how'll we do it i'll tell you said mike he proceeded to unfold his plan which was briefly this the two were to saunter up to where paul was standing and remain until the group if there were any around him should be dispersed then one was to pull his hat over his eyes while the other would snatch the basket containing his prize packages and run down liberty street never stopping until he landed in a certain alley known to both boys the other would run in a different direction and both would meet as soon as practicable for the division of the spoils it was yet so early that paul could not have sold many from his stock as each contained a prize varying from one penny to ten they would probably realize enough to buy a good breakfast besides the candy contained in the packages more money might be obtained by selling packages but there was risk in this besides it would take time and they decided that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush that's a good idea said jim approvingly who'll knock his hat over his head you can said mike and i'll grab the basket but to this jim demurred for two reasons first he was rather afraid of paul whose strength of arm he had tested on a previous occasion and again he was afraid that if mike got off with the basket he would appropriate the lion's share i'll grab the basket he said what for said mike suspiciously for he too felt some distrust of his confederate you're stronger'n i am mike said jim maybe he'd turn on me and i can't fight him as well as you that's so said mike who had rather a high idea of his own prowess and felt pleased with the compliment i'm a match for him of course you be said jim artfully and he knows it of course he does said mike boastfully i can lick him with one hand jim had serious doubts of this but he had his reasons for concurring in mike's estimate of his own powers we'd better start now said jim i'm awful hungry come along then they walked up liberty street as far as nassau on reaching the corner they saw their unconscious victim at his usual place it was rather a public place for an assault and both boys would have hesitated had they not been incited by a double motive the desire of gain and a feeling of hostility they sauntered along and mike pressed in close by paul what do you want asked paul not liking the vicinity what's that to you demanded mike quit crowdin me i ain't crowdin i've got as much right to be here as you here's your prize packages exclaimed paul in a businesslike tone maybe i'll buy one if you'll give me credit till to morrow said mike your credit isn't good with me said paul you must pay cash down then you won't trust me said mike pressing a little closer no i won't said paul decidedly then take that you spalpeen said mike suddenly pulling paul's hat over his eyes at the same time jim to whom he had tipped a wink snatched the basket which paul held loosely in his hand and disappeared round the corner the attack was so sudden and unexpected that paul was at first bewildered but he quickly recovered his presence of mind and saw into the trick he raised his hat and darted in pursuit of mike not knowing in what direction his basket had gone that's a mean trick he exclaimed indignantly give me back my basket you thief i ain't got no basket said mike facing round then you know where it is i don't know nothin of your basket you pulled my hat over my eyes on purpose to steal my basket no i didn't you insulted me that's why i did it tell me where my basket is or i'll lick you said paul incensed i ain't nothin to do with your basket take that then for pulling my hat over my eyes and paul suiting the action to the word dealt mike a staggering blow in the face i'll murder you shouted mike furiously dashing at paul with a blow which might have leveled him if he had not fended it off paul was not quarrelsome but he knew how to fight and he was prepared now to fight in earnest indignant as he was at the robbery which entailed upon him a loss he could ill sustain i'll give you all you want he said resolutely eyeing mike warily and watching a chance to give him another blow the contest was brief being terminated by the sudden and unwelcome arrival of a policeman what's this he asked authoritatively surveying the combatants paul with his flushed face and mike whose nose was bleeding freely from a successful blow of his adversary he pitched into me for nothin said mike glaring at paul and rubbing his bloody nose on the sleeve of his ragged coat that isn't true said paul excitedly he came up while i was selling prize packages of candy in front of the post office and pulled my hat over my eyes while another boy grabbed my basket you lie said mike i don't know nothin of your basket why did you pull his hat over his eyes asked the policeman because he insulted me how did he insult you he wouldn't trust me till to morrow i don't blame him much for that said the policeman who was aware of mike's shady reputation having on a former occasion been under the necessity of arresting him even without such acquaintance mike's general appearance would hardly have recommended him to officer jones i'll let you go this time he said but if i catch you fighting again on my beat i'll march you off to the station house mike was glad to escape though he would almost have been willing to be arrested if paul could have been arrested also the officer walked away and mike started down the street paul followed him that didn't suit mike's ideas as he was anxious to meet jim and divide the spoils with him what are you follerin me for he demanded angrily i have my reasons said paul then you'd better stay where you are your company ain't wanted i know that said paul but i'm going to follow you till i find my basket what do i know of your basket that's what i want to find out mike saw by paul's resolute tone that he meant what he said desirous of shaking him of he started on a run chapter vi paul as an artist paul was not slow in following mike he was a good runner and would have had no difficulty in keeping up with his enemy if the streets had been empty but to thread his way in and out among the numerous foot passengers that thronged the sidewalks was not so easy he kept up pretty well however until in turning a street corner he ran at full speed into a very stout gentleman whose scanty wind was quite knocked out of him by the collision he glared in anger at paul but could not at first obtain breath enough to speak i beg your pardon sir said paul who in spite of his desire to overtake mike felt it incumbent upon him to stop and offer an apology what do you mean sir exploded the fat man at last by tearing through the streets like a locomotive you've nearly killed me i am very sorry sir you ought to be don't you know better than to run at such speed you ought to be indicted as a public nuisance i was trying to catch a thief said paul trying to catch a thief how's that asked the stout gentleman his indignation giving way to curiosity i was selling packages in front of the post office when he and another boy came up and stole my basket indeed what were you selling prize packages sir what was in them candy could you make much that way about a dollar a day i'd rather have given you a dollar than had you run against me with such violence i feel it yet indeed sir i'm very sorry well i'll forgive you under the circumstances what's your name paul hoffman well i hope you'll get back your basket some time if you see me in the street come up and let me know would you know me again i think i should sir well good morning i hope you'll catch the thief i thank you sir they parted company but paul did not continue the pursuit the conversation in which he had taken part had lasted so long that mike had had plenty of time to find a refuge and there would be no use in following him so paul went home you are home early paul said his mother surely you haven't sold out by this time no but all my packages are gone how is that they were stolen tell me about it so paul told the story that mike was awful mean said jimmy indignantly i'd like to hit him i don't think you would hurt him much jimmy said paul amused at his little brother's vehemence then i wish i was a big strong boy said jimmy i hope you will be some time how much was your loss paul asked his mother there were nearly forty packages they cost me about a dollar but if i had sold them all they would have brought me in twice as much i had only sold ten packages shall you make some more no i think not said paul i've got tired of the business it's getting poorer every day i'll go out after dinner and see if i can't find something else to do you ain't going out now paul said jimmy no i'll stop and see you draw a little while that's bully i'm going to try these oxen that's a hard picture i don't think you can draw it jimmy yes i can said the little boy confidently just see if i don't jimmy has improved a good deal said his mother you'll be a great artist one of these days jimmy said paul i'm going to try paul said the little boy i like it so much little jimmy had indeed made surprising progress in drawing with no instruction whatever he had succeeded in a very close and accurate imitation of the sketches in the drawing books paul had purchased for him it was a great delight to the little boy to draw and hour after hour as his mother sat at her work he sat up to the table and worked at his drawing scarcely speaking a word unless spoken to so absorbed was he in his fascinating employment paul watched him attentively you'll make a bully artist jimmy he said at length really surprised at his little brother's proficiency if you keep on a little longer you'll beat me i wish you'd draw something paul said jimmy i never saw any of your drawings i am afraid if you saw mine it would discourage you said paul you know i'm older and ought to draw better his face was serious but there was a merry twinkle of fun in his eyes of course i know you draw better said jimmy seriously what shall i draw asked paul try this horse paul all right said paul but you must go away i don't want you to see it till it is done jimmy left the table and paul commenced his attempt now though paul is the hero of my story i am bound to confess that he had not the slightest talent for drawing though jimmy did not know it it was only to afford his little brother amusement that he now undertook the task paul worked away for about five minutes it's done he said so quick exclaimed jimmy in surprise how fast you work he drew near and inspected paul's drawing he had no sooner inspected it than he burst into a fit of laughter paul's drawing was a very rough one and such a horse as he had drawn will never probably be seen until the race has greatly degenerated what's the matter jimmy asked paul don't you like it it's awful paul said the little boy almost choking with mirth i see how it is said paul with feigned resentment you're jealous of me because you can't draw as well oh paul you'll kill me and jimmy again burst into a fit of merriment can't you really draw any better no jimmy said paul joining in the laugh i can't draw any better than an old cow you've got all the talent in the family in that line but you're smart in other ways paul said jimmy who had a great admiration of paul notwithstanding the discovery of his artistic inferiority i'm glad there's one that thinks so jimmy said paul i'll refer to you when i want a recommendation jimmy resumed his drawing and was proud of the praises which paul freely bestowed upon him i'll get you a harder drawing book when you've got through with these said paul that is if i don't get reduced to poverty by having my stock in trade stolen again after a while came dinner this meal in mrs hoffman's household usually came at twelve o'clock it was a plain frugal meal always but on sunday they usually managed to have something a little better as they had been accustomed to do when mr hoffman was alive paul was soon through he took his hat from the bureau and prepared to go out i'm going out to try my luck mother he said i'll see if i can't get into something i like a little better than the prize package business i hope you'll succeed paul better than i did in drawing horses eh jimmy yes i hope so paul said the little boy don't you show that horse to visitors and pretend it's yours jimmy no danger paul paul went downstairs and into the street he had no definite plan in his head but was ready for anything that might turn up he did not feel anxious for he knew there were plenty of ways in which he could earn something he had never tried blacking boots but still he could do it in case of emergency he had sold papers and succeeded fairly in that line and knew he could again he had pitted himself against other boys and the result had been to give him a certain confidence in his own powers and business abilities when he had first gone into the street to try his chances there it had been with a degree of diffidence but knocking about the streets soon gives a boy confidence sometimes too much of it and paul had learned to rely upon himself but the influence of a good though humble home and a judicious mother had kept him aloof from the bad habits into which many street boys are led so paul though his stock in trade had been stolen and he was obliged to seek a new kind of business was by no means disheartened he walked a little way downtown and then crossing the city hall park found himself on broadway a little below the astor house he came"
