dragged me here once when we first came to paris but i never found my way back but you say you know paris so well i don’t call this paris cried mr tristram with assurance come let’s go over to the palais royal and have a smoke i don’t smoke said newman a drink then and mr tristram led his companion away they passed through the glorious halls of the louvre down the staircases along the cool dim galleries of sculpture and out into the enormous court newman looked about him as he went but he made no comments and it was only when they at last emerged into the open air that he said to his friend it seems to me that in your place i should have come here once a week oh no you wouldn’t said mr tristram you think so but you wouldn’t you wouldn’t have had time you would always mean to go but you never would go there’s better fun than that here in paris italy’s the place to see pictures wait till you get there there you have to go you can’t do anything else it’s an awful country you can’t get a decent cigar i don’t know why i went in there to day i was strolling along rather hard up for amusement i sort of noticed the louvre as i passed and i thought i would go in and see what was going on but if i hadn’t found you there i should have felt rather sold hang it i don’t care for pictures i prefer the reality and mr tristram tossed off this happy formula with an assurance which the numerous class of persons suffering from an overdose of culture might have envied him the two gentlemen proceeded along the rue de rivoli and into the palais royal where they seated themselves at one of the little tables stationed at the door of the café which projects into the great open quadrangle the place was filled with people the fountains were spouting a band was playing clusters of chairs were gathered beneath all the lime trees and buxom white capped nurses seated along the benches were offering to their infant charges the amplest facilities for nutrition there was an easy homely gaiety in the whole scene and christopher newman felt that it was most characteristically parisian and now began mr tristram when they had tested the decoction which he had caused to be served to them now just give an account of yourself what are your ideas what are your plans where have you come from and where are you going in the first place where are you staying at the grand hotel said newman mr tristram puckered his plump visage that won’t do you must change change demanded newman why it’s the finest hotel i ever was in you don’t want a fine hotel you want something small and quiet and elegant where your bell is answered and you your person is recognized they keep running to see if i have rung before i have touched the bell said newman and as for my person they are always bowing and scraping to it i suppose you are always tipping them that’s very bad style always by no means a man brought me something yesterday and then stood loafing in a beggarly manner i offered him a chair and asked him if he wouldn’t sit down was that bad style very but he bolted instantly at any rate the place amuses me hang your elegance if it bores me i sat in the court of the grand hotel last night until two o’clock in the morning watching the coming and going and the people knocking about you’re easily pleased but you can do as you choose a man in your shoes you have made a pile of money eh i have made enough happy the man who can say that enough for what enough to rest awhile to forget the confounded thing to look about me to see the world to have a good time to improve my mind and if the fancy takes me to marry a wife newman spoke slowly with a certain dryness of accent and with frequent pauses this was his habitual mode of utterance but it was especially marked in the words i have just quoted jupiter there’s a programme cried mr tristram certainly all that takes money especially the wife unless indeed she gives it as mine did and what’s the story how have you done it newman had pushed his hat back from his forehead folded his arms and stretched his legs he listened to the music he looked about him at the bustling crowd at the plashing fountains at the nurses and the babies i have worked he answered at last tristram looked at him for some moments and allowed his placid eyes to measure his friend’s generous longitude and rest upon his comfortably contemplative face what have you worked at he asked oh at several things i suppose you’re a smart fellow eh newman continued to look at the nurses and babies they imparted to the scene a kind of primordial pastoral simplicity yes he said at last i suppose i am and then in answer to his companion’s inquiries he related briefly his history since their last meeting it was an intensely western story and it dealt with enterprises which it will be needless to introduce to the reader in detail newman had come out of the war with a brevet of brigadier general an honor which in this case without invidious comparisons had lighted upon shoulders amply competent to bear it but though he could manage a fight when need was newman heartily disliked the business his four years in the army had left him with an angry bitter sense of the waste of precious things life and time and money and smartness and the early freshness of purpose and he had addressed himself to the pursuits of peace with passionate zest and energy he was of course as penniless when he plucked off his shoulder straps as when he put them on and the only capital at his disposal was his dogged resolution and his lively perception of ends and means exertion and action were as natural to him as respiration a more completely healthy mortal had never trod the elastic soil of the west his experience moreover was as wide as his capacity when he was fourteen years old necessity had taken him by his slim young shoulders and pushed him into the street to earn that night’s supper he had not earned it but he had earned the next night’s and afterwards whenever he had had none it was because he had gone without it to use the money for something else a keener pleasure or a finer profit he had turned his hand with his brain in it to many things he had been enterprising in an eminent sense of the term he had been adventurous and even reckless and he had known bitter failure as well as brilliant success but he was a born experimentalist and he had always found something to enjoy in the pressure of necessity even when it was as irritating as the haircloth shirt of the mediæval monk at one time failure seemed inexorably his portion ill luck became his bed fellow and whatever he touched he turned not to gold but to ashes his most vivid conception of a supernatural element in the world’s affairs had come to him once when this pertinacity of misfortune was at its climax there seemed to him something stronger in life than his own will but the mysterious something could only be the devil and he was accordingly seized with an intense personal enmity to this impertinent force he had known what it was to have utterly exhausted his credit to be unable to raise a dollar and to find himself at nightfall in a strange city without a penny to mitigate its strangeness it was under these circumstances that he made his entrance into san francisco the scene subsequently of his happiest strokes of fortune if he did not like dr franklin in philadelphia march along the street munching a penny loaf it was only because he had not the penny loaf necessary to the performance in his darkest days he had had but one simple practical impulse the desire as he would have phrased it to see the thing through he did so at last buffeted his way into smooth waters and made money largely it must be admitted rather nakedly that christopher newman’s sole aim in life had been to make money what he had been placed in the world for was to his own perception simply to wrest a fortune the bigger the better from defiant opportunity this idea completely filled his horizon and satisfied his imagination upon the uses of money upon what one might do with a life into which one had succeeded in injecting the golden stream he had up to his thirty fifth year very scantily reflected life had been for him an open game and he had played for high stakes he had won at last and carried off his winnings and now what was he to do with them he was a man to whom sooner or later the question was sure to present itself and the answer to it belongs to our story a vague sense that more answers were possible than his philosophy had hitherto dreamt of had already taken possession of him and it seemed softly and agreeably to deepen as he lounged in this brilliant corner of paris with his friend i must confess he presently went on that here i don’t feel at all smart my remarkable talents seem of no use i feel as simple as a little child and a little child might take me by the hand and lead me about oh i’ll be your little child said tristram jovially i’ll take you by the hand trust yourself to me i am a good worker newman continued but i rather think i am a poor loafer i have come abroad to amuse myself but i doubt whether i know how oh that’s easily learned well i may perhaps learn it but i am afraid i shall never do it by rote i have the best will in the world about it but my genius doesn’t lie in that direction as a loafer i shall never be original as i take it that you are yes said tristram i suppose i am original like all those immoral pictures in the louvre besides newman continued i don’t want to work at pleasure any more than i played at work i want to take it easily i feel deliciously lazy and i should like to spend six months as i am now sitting under a tree and listening to a band there’s only one thing i want to hear some good music music and pictures lord what refined tastes you are what my wife calls intellectual i ain’t a bit but we can find something better for you to do than to sit under a tree to begin with you must come to the club what club the occidental you will see all the americans there all the best of them at least of course you play poker oh i say cried newman with energy you are not going to lock me up in a club and stick me down at a card table i haven’t come all this way for that what the deuce _have_ you come for you were glad enough to play poker in st louis i recollect when you cleaned me out i have come to see europe to get the best out of it i can i want to see all the great things and do what the clever people do the clever people much obliged you set me down as a blockhead then newman was sitting sidewise in his chair with his elbow on the back and his head leaning on his hand without moving he looked a while at his companion with his dry guarded half inscrutable and yet altogether good natured smile introduce me to your wife he said at last tristram bounced about in his chair upon my word i won’t she doesn’t want any help to turn up her nose at me nor do you either i don’t turn up my nose at you my dear fellow nor at anyone or anything i’m not proud i assure you i’m not proud that’s why i am willing to take example by the clever people well if i’m not the rose as they say here i have lived near it i can show you some clever people too do you know general packard do you know c p hatch do you know miss kitty upjohn i shall be happy to make their acquaintance i want to cultivate society tristram seemed restless and suspicious he eyed his friend askance and then what are you up to anyway he demanded are you going to write a book christopher newman twisted one end of his moustache a while in silence and at last he made answer one day a couple of months ago something very curious happened to me i had come on to new york on some important business it was rather a long story a question of getting ahead of another party in a certain particular way in the stock market this other party had once played me a very mean trick i owed him a grudge i felt awfully savage at the time and i vowed that when i got a chance i would figuratively speaking put his nose out of joint there was a matter of some sixty thousand dollars at stake if i put it out of his way it was a blow the fellow would feel and he really deserved no quarter i jumped into a hack and went about my business and it was in this hack this immortal historical hack that the curious thing i speak of occurred it was a hack like any other only a trifle dirtier with a greasy line along the top of the drab cushions as if it had been used for a great many irish funerals it is possible i took a nap i had been traveling all night and though i was excited with my errand i felt the want of sleep at all events i woke up suddenly from a sleep or from a kind of a reverie with the most extraordinary feeling in the world a mortal disgust for the thing i was going to do it came upon me like _that and he snapped his fingers as abruptly as an old wound that begins to ache i couldn’t tell the meaning of it i only felt that i loathed the whole business and wanted to wash my hands of it the idea of losing that sixty thousand dollars of letting it utterly slide and scuttle and never hearing of it again seemed the sweetest thing in the world and all this took place quite independently of my will and i sat watching it as if it were a play at the theatre i could feel it going on inside of me you may depend upon it that there are things going on inside of us that we understand mighty little about jupiter you make my flesh creep cried tristram and while you sat in your hack watching the play as you call it the other man marched in and bagged your sixty thousand dollars i have not the least idea i hope so poor devil but i never found out we pulled up in front of the place i was going to in wall street but i sat still in the carriage and at last the driver scrambled down off his seat to see whether his carriage had not turned into a hearse i couldn’t have got out any more than if i had been a corpse what was the matter with me momentary idiocy you’ll say what i wanted to get out of was wall street i told the man to drive down to the brooklyn ferry and to cross over when we were over i told him to drive me out into the country as i had told him originally to drive for dear life down town i suppose he thought me insane perhaps i was but in that case i am insane still i spent the morning looking at the first green leaves on long island i was sick of business i wanted to throw it all up and break off short i had money enough or if i hadn’t i ought to have i seemed to feel a new man inside my old skin and i longed for a new world when you want a thing so very badly you had better treat yourself to it i didn’t understand the matter not in the least but i gave the old horse the bridle and let him find his way as soon as i could get out of the game i sailed for europe that is how i come to be sitting here you ought to have bought up that hack said tristram it isn’t a safe vehicle to have about and you have really sold out then you have retired from business i have made over my hand to a friend when i feel disposed i can take up the cards again i dare say that a twelvemonth hence the operation will be reversed the pendulum will swing back again i shall be sitting in a gondola or on a dromedary and all of a sudden i shall want to clear out but for the present i am perfectly free i have even bargained that i am to receive no business letters oh it’s a real _caprice de prince_ said tristram i back out a poor devil like me can’t help you to spend such very magnificent leisure as that you should get introduced to the crowned heads newman looked at him a moment and then with his easy smile how does one do it he asked come i like that cried tristram it shows you are in earnest of course i am in earnest didn’t i say i wanted the best i know the best can’t be had for mere money but i rather think money will do a good deal in addition i am willing to take a good deal of trouble you are not bashful eh i haven’t the least idea i want the biggest kind of entertainment a man can get people places art nature everything i want to see the tallest mountains and the bluest lakes and the finest pictures and the handsomest churches and the most celebrated men and the most beautiful women settle down in paris then there are no mountains that i know of and the only lake is in the bois du boulogne and not particularly blue but there is everything else plenty of pictures and churches no end of celebrated men and several beautiful women but i can’t settle down in paris at this season just as summer is coming on oh for the summer go up to trouville what is trouville the french newport half the americans go is it anywhere near the alps about as near as newport is to the rocky mountains oh i want to see mont blanc said newman and amsterdam and the rhine and a lot of places venice in particular i have great ideas about venice ah said mr tristram rising i see i shall have to introduce you to my wife chapter iii he performed this ceremony on the following day when by appointment christopher newman went to dine with him mr and mrs tristram lived behind one of those chalk colored façades which decorate with their pompous sameness the broad avenues manufactured by baron haussmann in the neighborhood of the arc de triomphe their apartment was rich in the modern conveniences and tristram lost no time in calling his visitor’s attention to their principal household treasures the gas lamps and the furnace holes whenever you feel homesick he said you must come up here we’ll stick you down before a register under a good big burner and and you will soon get over your homesickness said mrs tristram her husband stared his wife often had a tone which he found inscrutable he could not tell for his life whether she was in jest or in earnest the truth is that circumstances had done much to cultivate in mrs tristram a marked tendency to irony her taste on many points differed from that of her husband and though she made frequent concessions it must be confessed that her concessions were not always graceful they were founded upon a vague project she had of some day doing something very positive something a trifle passionate what she meant to do she could by no means have told you but meanwhile nevertheless she was buying a good conscience by instalments it should be added without delay to anticipate misconception that her little scheme of independence did not definitely involve the assistance of another person of the opposite sex she was not saving up virtue to cover the expenses of a flirtation for this there were various reasons to begin with she had a very plain face and she was entirely without illusions as to her appearance she had taken its measure to a hair’s breadth she knew the worst and the best she had accepted herself it had not been indeed without a struggle as a young girl she had spent hours with her back to her mirror crying her eyes out and later she had from desperation and bravado adopted the habit of proclaiming herself the most ill favored of women in order that she might as in common politeness was inevitable be contradicted and reassured it was since she had come to live in europe that she had begun to take the matter philosophically her observation acutely exercised here had suggested to her that a woman’s first duty is not to be beautiful but to be pleasing and she encountered so many women who pleased without beauty that she began to feel that she had discovered her mission she had once heard an enthusiastic musician out of patience with a gifted bungler declare that a fine voice is really an obstacle to singing properly and it occurred to her that it might perhaps be equally true that a beautiful face is an obstacle to the acquisition of charming manners mrs tristram then undertook to be exquisitely agreeable and she brought to the task a really touching devotion how well she would have succeeded i am unable to say unfortunately she broke off in the middle her own excuse was the want of encouragement in her immediate circle but i am inclined to think that she had not a real genius for the matter or she would have pursued the charming art for itself the poor lady was very incomplete she fell back upon the harmonies of the toilet which she thoroughly understood and contented herself with dressing in perfection she lived in paris which she pretended to detest because it was only in paris that one could find things to exactly suit one’s complexion besides out of paris it was always more or less of a trouble to get ten button gloves when she railed at this serviceable city and you asked her where she would prefer to reside she returned some very unexpected answer she would say in copenhagen or in barcelona having while making the tour of europe spent a couple of days at each of these places on the whole with her poetic furbelows and her misshapen intelligent little face she was when you knew her a decidedly interesting woman she was naturally shy and if she had been born a beauty she would having no vanity probably have remained shy now she was both diffident and importunate extremely reserved sometimes with her friends and strangely expansive with strangers she despised her husband despised him too much for she had been perfectly at liberty not to marry him she had been in love with a clever man who had slighted her and she had married a fool in the hope that this thankless wit reflecting on it would conclude that she had no appreciation of merit and that he had flattered himself in supposing that she cared for his own restless discontented visionary without personal ambitions but with a certain avidity of imagination she was as i have said before eminently incomplete she was full both for good and for ill of beginnings that came to nothing but she had nevertheless morally a spark of the sacred fire newman was fond under all circumstances of the society of women and now that he was out of his native element and deprived of his habitual interests he turned to it for compensation he took a great fancy to mrs tristram she frankly repaid it and after their first meeting he passed a great many hours in her drawing room after two or three talks they were fast friends newman’s manner with women was peculiar and it required some ingenuity on a lady’s part to discover that he admired her he had no gallantry in the usual sense of the term no compliments no graces no speeches very fond of what is called chaffing in his dealings with men he never found himself on a sofa beside a member of the softer sex without feeling extremely serious he was not shy and so far as awkwardness proceeds from a struggle with shyness he was not awkward grave attentive submissive often silent he was simply swimming in a sort of rapture of respect this emotion was not at all theoretic it was not even in a high degree sentimental he had thought very little about the position of women and he was not familiar either sympathetically or otherwise with the image of a president in petticoats his attitude was simply the flower of his general good nature and a part of his instinctive and genuinely democratic assumption of everyone’s right to lead an easy life if a shaggy pauper had a right to bed and board and wages and a vote women of course who were weaker than paupers and whose physical tissue was in itself an appeal should be maintained sentimentally at the public expense newman was willing to be taxed for this purpose largely in proportion to his means moreover many of the common traditions with regard to women were with him fresh personal impressions he had never read a novel he had been struck with their acuteness their subtlety their tact their felicity of judgment they seemed to him exquisitely organized if it is true that one must always have in one’s work here below a religion or at least an ideal of some sort newman found his metaphysical inspiration in a vague acceptance of final responsibility to some illumined feminine brow he spent a great deal of time in listening to advice from mrs tristram advice it must be added for which he had never asked he would have been incapable of asking for it for he had no perception of difficulties and consequently no curiosity about remedies the complex parisian world about him seemed a very simple affair it was an immense amazing spectacle but it neither inflamed his imagination nor irritated his curiosity he kept his hands in his pockets looked on good humoredly desired to miss nothing important observed a great many things narrowly and never reverted to himself mrs tristram’s advice was a part of the show and a more entertaining element in her abundant gossip than the others he enjoyed her talking about himself it seemed a part of her beautiful ingenuity but he never made an application of anything she said or remembered it when he was away from her for herself she appropriated him he was the most interesting thing she had had to think about in many a month she wished to do something with him she hardly knew what there was so much of him he was so rich and robust so easy friendly well disposed that he kept her fancy constantly on the alert for the present the only thing she could do was to like him she told him that he was horribly western but in this compliment the adverb was tinged with insincerity she led him about with her introduced him to fifty people and took extreme satisfaction in her conquest newman accepted every proposal shook hands universally and promiscuously and seemed equally unfamiliar with trepidation or with elation tom tristram complained of his wife’s avidity and declared that he could never have a clear five minutes with his friend if he had known how things were going to turn out he never would have brought him to the avenue d’iéna the two men formerly had not been intimate but newman remembered his earlier impression of his host and did mrs tristram who had by no means taken him into her confidence but whose secret he presently discovered the justice to admit that her husband was a rather degenerate mortal at twenty five he had been a good fellow and"
