"1" "it was a break and he wanted it i hadn't time to think the only idea i had was that if i refused him he might tell some dirty little lie about me i was all confused mixed up i felt just as though it were a snake that i had to humor to get rid of i gave him the break condy sat speechless suddenly he arose well now let's see he began speaking rapidly his hands twisting and untwisting till the knuckles cracked now let's see you leave it to me i know carter he's going to be at a stag dinner where i am invited to morrow night and i i no you won't condy said travis placidly you'll pay no attention to it and i'll tell you why suppose you should make a scene with mr carter i don't know how men settle these things well it would be told in all the clubs and in all the newspaper offices that two men had quarreled over a girl and my name is mentioned discussed and handed around from one crowd of men to another from one club to another and then of course the papers take it up by that time mr carter will have told his side of the story and invented another dirty little lie and i'm the one who suffers the most in the end and remember condy that i haven't any mother in such an affair not even an older sister no we'll just let the matter drop it would be more dignified anyhow only i have made up my mind what i am going to do what's that i'm not coming out if that's the sort of thing one has to put up with in society travis drew a little line on the sofa at her side with her finger tip i am going to stop right there it's not miss bessemer stiffened again that i'm afraid of jack carter and his dirty stories i simply don't want to know the kind of people who have made jack carter possible the other girls don't mind it nor many men besides you condy and i'm not going to be associated with people who take it as a joke for a man to come to a function drunk and as for having a good time i'll find my amusements somewhere else i'll ride a wheel take long walks study something but as for leading the life of a society girl no and whether i have a good time or not i'll keep my own self respect at least i'll never have to dance with a drunken man i won't have to humiliate myself like that a second time but i presume you will still continue to go out somewhere protested condy rivers she shook her head i have thought it all over and i've talked about it with papum there's no half way about it the only way to stop is to stop short just this afternoon i've regretted three functions for next week and i shall resign from the saturday evening oh it's not the jack carter affair alone she exclaimed the whole thing tires me mind condy she exclaimed i'm not going to break with it because i have any purpose in life or that sort of thing i want to have a good time and i'm going to see if i can't have it in my own way if the kind of thing that makes jack carter possible is conventionality then i'm done with conventionality for good i am going to try from this time on to be just as true to myself as i can be i am going to be sincere and not pretend to like people and things that i don't like and i'm going to do the things that i like to do just so long as they are the things a good girl can do see condy you're fine murmured condy breathless you're fine as gold travis and i i love you all the better for it ah now exclaimed travis with a brusque movement there's mother thing we must talk about no more foolishness between us we've had a jolly little flirtation i know and it's been good fun while it lasted i know you like me and you know that i like you but as for loving each other you know we don't yes you say that you love me and that i'm the only girl that's part of the game i can play it her little eyes began to dance quite as well as you but it's playing with something that's quite too serious to be played with after all isn't it now it's insincere and as i tell you from now on i'm going to be as true and as sincere and as honest as i can but i tell you that i do love you protested condy trying to make the words ring true travis looked about the room an instant as if in deliberation then abruptly ah what am i going to do with such a boy as you are after all a great big overgrown boy condy rivers look at me straight in the eye tell me do you honestly love me you know what i mean when i say love do you love me no i don't he exclaimed blankly as though he had just discovered the fact there declared travis and i don't love you they both began to laugh now added travis we don't need to have the burden and trouble of keeping up the pretences any more we understand each other don't we this is queer enough said condy drolly but isn't it an improvement condy scoured his head tell me the truth she insisted you be sincere i do believe it is why why travis by jingo travis i think i'm going to like you better than ever now never mind is it an agreement what is that we don't pretend to love each other any more all right yes you're right because the moment i began to love you i should like you so much less she put out her hand that's an agreement then condy took her hand in his yes it's an agreement but when as had been his custom he made as though to kiss her hand travis drew it quickly away no no she said firmly smiling for all that no more foolishness but but he protested it's not so radical as that is it you're not going to overturn such time worn time honored customs as that why this is a regular rebellion no sire quoted travis trying not to laugh it is a revolution chapter iii although monday was practically a holiday for the sunday supplement staff of the times condy rivers made a point to get down to the office betimes the next morning there were reasons why a certain article descriptive of a great whaleback steamer taking on grain for famine stricken india should be written that day and rivers wanted his afternoon free in order to go to laurie flagg's coming out tea but as he came into his room at the times office which he shared with the exchange and sporting editors and settled himself at his desk he suddenly remembered that under the new order of things he need not expect to see travis at the flaggs well he muttered maybe it doesn't make so much difference after all she was a corking fine girl but might as well admit it the play is played out of course i don't love her any more than she loves me i'll see less and less of her now it's inevitable and after a while we'll hardly even meet in a way it's a pity but of course one has to be sensible about these things well this whaleback now he rang up the chamber of commerce and found out that the city of everett which was the whaleback's name was at the mission street wharf this made it possible for him to write the article in two ways he either could fake his copy from a clipping on the subject which the exchange editor had laid on his desk or he could go down in person to the wharf interview the captain and inspect the craft for himself the former was the short and easy method the latter was more troublesome but would result in a far more interesting article condy debated the subject a few minutes then decided to go down to the wharf san francisco's water front was always interesting and he might get hold of a photograph of the whaleback all at once the idea of the article struck him the certain underlying notion that would give importance and weight to the mere details and descriptions condy's enthusiasm flared up in an instant by jove he exclaimed by jove he clapped on his hat wrong side foremost crammed a sheaf of copy paper into his pocket and was on the street again in another moment then it occurred to him that he had forgotten to call at his club that morning for his mail as was his custom on the way to the office he looked at his watch it was early yet and his club was but two blocks distance he decided that he would get his letters at the club and read them on the way down to the wharf for condy had joined a certain san francisco club of artists journalists musicians and professional men that is one of the institutions of the city and in fact famous throughout the united states he was one of the younger members but was popular and well liked and on more than one occasion had materially contributed to the fun of the club's low jinks in his box this morning he found one letter that he told himself he must read upon the instant it bore upon the envelope the name of a new york publishing house to whom condy had sent a collection of his short stories about a month before he took the letter into the round window of the club overlooking the street and tore it open excitedly the fact that he had received a letter from the firm without the return of his manuscript seemed a good omen this was what he read conde rivers esq bohemian club san francisco cal dear sir we return to you by this mail the manuscript of your stories which we do not consider as available for publication at the present moment we would say however that we find in several of them indications of a quite unusual order of merit the best selling book just now is the short novel say thirty thousand words of action and adventure judging from the stories of your collection we suspect that your talent lies in this direction and we would suggest that you write such a novel and submit the same to us very respectfully the centennial co new york condy shoved the letter into his pocket and collapsed limply into his chair what's the good of trying to do anything anyhow he muttered looking gloomily down into the street my level is just the hack work of a local sunday supplement and i am a fool to think of anything else his enthusiasm in the matter of the city of everett was cold and dead in a moment he could see no possibilities in the subject whatever his idea of a few minutes previous seemed ridiculous and overwrought he would go back to the office and grind out his copy from the exchange editor's clipping just then his eye was caught by a familiar figure in trim well fitting black halted on the opposite corner waiting for the passage of a cable car it was travis bessemer no one but she could carry off such rigorous simplicity in the matter of dress so well black skirt black russian blouse tiny black bonnet and black veil white kids with black stitching simplicity itself yet the style of her as condy rivers told himself flew up and hit you in the face and her figure was there anything more perfect and the soft pretty effect of her yellow hair seen through the veil could anything be more fetching and her smart carriage and the fling of her fine broad shoulders and no it was no use condy had to run down to speak to her come come she said as he pretended to jostle against her on the curbstone without noticing her you had best go to work loafing at ten o'clock on the street corners the idea it is not it can not be and yet it is it is she he burlesqued and after all these years then in his natural voice hello t.b hello c.r where are you going home i've just run down for half an hour to have the head of my banjo tightened if i put you on the car will you expect me to pay your car fare condy rivers i've long since got over the idea of ever expecting you to have any change concealed about your person huh no it all goes for theatre tickets and flowers and boxes of candy for a certain girl i know but and he glared at her significantly no more foolishness she laughed what are you on this morning condy condy told her as they started to walk toward kearney street but why don't you go to the dock and see the vessel if you can make a better article that way oh what's the good the centennial people have turned down my stories she commiserated him for this then suddenly exclaimed no you must go down to the dock you ought to condy oh i tell you let me go down with you in an instant condy leaped to the notion splendid splendid no reason why you shouldn't he exclaimed and within fifteen minutes the two were treading the wharves and quays of the city's water front ships innumerable nuzzled at the endless line of docks mast overspiring mast and bowsprit overlapping bowsprit till the eye was bewildered as if by the confusion of branches in a leafless forest in the distance the mass of rigging resolved itself into a solid gray blur against the sky the great hulks green and black and slate gray laid themselves along the docks straining leisurely at their mammoth chains their flanks opened their cargoes as it were their entrails spewed out in a wild disarray of crate and bale and box sailors and stevedores swarmed them like vermin trucks rolled along the wharves like peals of ordnance the horse hoofs beating the boards like heavy drum taps chains clanked a ship's dog barked incessantly from a companionway ropes creaked in complaining pulleys blocks rattled hoisting engines coughed and strangled while all the air was redolent of oakum of pitch of paint of spices of ripe fruit of clean cool lumber of coffee of tar of bilge and the brisk nimble odor of the sea travis was delighted her little brown eyes snapping her cheeks flushing as she drank in the scene to think she cried where all these ships have come from look at their names aren't they perfect just the names see the mary baker hull and the anandale liverpool and the two sisters calcutta and see that one they're calking the montevideo callao and there look look the very one you're looking for the city of everett san francisco the whaleback an immense tube of steel plates lay at her wharf sucking in entire harvests of wheat from the san joaquin valley harvests that were to feed strangely clad skeletons on the southern slopes of the himalaya foot hills travis and condy edged their way among piles of wheat bags dodging drays and rumbling trucks and finally brought up at the after gangplank where a sailor halted them condy exhibited his reporter's badge i represent the times he said with profound solemnity and i want to see the officer in charge the sailor fell back upon the instant power of the press whispered condy to travis as the two gained the deck a second sailor directed them to the mate whom they found in the chart room engaged singularly enough in trimming the leaves of a scraggly geranium condy explained his mission with flattering allusions to the whaleback and the novelty of the construction the mate an old man with a patriarchal beard softened at once asked them into his own cabin aft and even brought out a camp stool for travis brushing it with his sleeve before setting it down while condy was interviewing the old fellow travis was examining with the interest of a child the details of the cabin the rack like bunk the washstand ingeniously constructed so as to shut into the bulkhead when not in use the alarm clock screwed to the wall and the array of photographs thrust into the mirror between frame and glass one an old daguerreotype particularly caught her fancy it was the portrait of a very beautiful girl wearing the old fashioned side curls and high comb of a half century previous the old mate noticed the attention she paid to it and as soon as he had done giving information to condy turned and nodded to travis and said quietly she was pretty wasn't she oh very answered travis without looking away there was a silence then the mate his eyes wide and thoughtful said with a long breath and she was just about your age miss when i saw her and you favor her too condy and travis held their breaths in attention there in the cabin of that curious nondescript whaleback they had come suddenly to the edge of a romance a romance that had been lived through before they were born then travis said in a low voice and sweetly she died before i ever set eyes on her miss that is maybe she died i sometimes think fact is i really believe she's alive yet and waiting for me he hesitated awkwardly i dunno he said pulling his beard i don't usually tell that story to strange folk but you remind me so of her that i guess i will condy sat down on the edge of the bunk and the mate seated himself on the plush settle opposite the door his elbows on his knees his eyes fixed on a patch of bright sunlight upon the deck outside i began life he said as a deep sea diver began pretty young too i first put on the armor when i was twenty nothing but a lad but i could take the pressure up to seventy pounds even then one of my very first dives was off trincomalee on the coast of ceylon a mail packet had gone down in a squall with all on board six of the bodies had come up and had been recovered but the seventh hadn't it was the body of the daughter of the governor of the island a beautiful young girl of nineteen whom everybody loved i was sent for to go down and bring the body up well i went down the packet lay in a hundred feet of water and that's a wonder deep dive i had to go down twice the first time i couldn't find anything though i went all through the berth deck i came up to the wrecking float and reported that i had seen nothing there were a lot of men there belonging to the wrecking gang and some correspondents of london papers but they would have it that she was below and had me go down again i did and this time i found her the mate paused a moment i'll have to tell you he went on that when a body don't come to the surface it will stand or sit in a perfectly natural position until a current or movement of the water around touches it when that happens well you'd say the body was alive and old divers have a superstition no it ain't just a superstition i believe it's so that drowned people really don't die till they come to the surface and the air touches them we say that the drowned who don't come up still have some sort of life of their own way down there in all that green water some kind of life surely surely when i went down the second time i came across the door of what i thought at first was the linen closet but it turned out to be a little stateroom i opened it there was the girl she was sitting on the sofa opposite the door with a little hat on her head and holding a satchel in her lap just as if she was ready to go ashore her eyes were wide open and she was looking right at me and smiling it didn't seem terrible or ghastly in the least she seemed very sweet when i opened the door it set the water in motion and she got up and dropped the satchel and came toward me smiling and holding out her arms i stepped back quick and shut the door and sat down in one of the saloon chairs to fetch my breath for it had given me a start the next thing to do was to send her up but i began to think she seemed so pretty as she was what was the use of bringing her up up there on the wrecking float with that crowd of men up where the air would get at her and where they would put her in the ground along o the worms if i left her there she'd always be sweet and pretty always be nineteen and i remembered what old divers said about drowned people living just so long as they stayed below you see i was only a lad then and things like that impress you when you're young well i signaled to be hauled up they asked me on the float if i'd seen anything and i said no that was all there was to the affair they never raised the ship and in a little while it was all forgotten but i never forgot it and i always remembered her way down there in all that still green water waiting there in that little state room for me to come back and open the door and i've growed to be an old man remembering her but she's always stayed just as she was the first day i saw her when she came toward me smiling and holding out her arms she's always stayed young and fresh and pretty i never saw her but that once only afterward i got her picture from a native woman of trincomalee who was house keeper at the residency where the governor of the island lived somehow i never could care for other women after that and i ain't never married for that reason no no of course not exclaimed travis in a low voice as the old fellow paused fine fine oh fine as gold murmured condy under his breath well said the mate getting up and rubbing his knee that's the story now you know all about that picture will you have a glass of madeira miss he got out a bottle of wine bearing the genuine funchal label and filled three tiny glasses travis pushed up her veil and she and condy rose this is to her said travis gravely thank you miss answered the mate and the three drank in silence as travis and condy were going down the gangplank they met the captain of the whaleback coming up i saw you in there talking to old mcpherson he explained did you get what you wanted from him more more exclaimed condy my hand in the fire he told you that yarn about the girl who was drowned off trincomalee of course i knew it the old boy's wits are turned on that subject he will have it that the body hasn't decomposed in all this time good seaman enough and a first class navigator but he's soft in that one spot chapter iv oh but the story of it exclaimed condy as he and travis regained the wharf the story of it isn't it a ripper isn't it a corker his leaving her that way and never caring for any other girl afterward and so original she commented quite as enthusiastic as he original why it's new as paint it's it's travis i'll make a story out of this that will be copied in every paper between the two oceans they were so interested in the mate's story that they forgot to take a car and walked up clay street talking it over suggesting rearranging and embellishing and condy was astonished and delighted to note that she caught on to the idea as quickly as he and knew the telling points and what details to leave out and i'll make a bang up article out of the whaleback herself declared condy the idea of the article had returned to him and all his enthusiasm with it and look here he said showing her the letter from the centennial company they turned down my book but see what they say quite an unusual order of merit cried travis why that's fine why didn't you show this to me before and asking you like this to write them a novel of adventure what more can you want oh she exclaimed impatiently that's so like you you would tell everybody about your reverses and carry on about them yourself but never say a word when you get a little boom have you an idea for a thirty thousand word novel wouldn't that diver's story do no there's not enough in that for thirty thousand words i haven't any idea at all never wrote a story of adventure never wrote anything longer than six thousand words but i'll keep my eye open for something that will do by the way by jove travis where are we they looked briskly around them and the bustling breezy waterfront faded from their recollections they were in a world of narrow streets of galleries and overhanging balconies craziest structures riddled and honeycombed with stairways and passages shut out the sky though here and there rose a building of extraordinary richness and most elaborate ornamentation color was everywhere a thousand little notes of green and yellow of vermilion and sky blue assaulted the eye here it was a doorway here a vivid glint of cloth or hanging here a huge scarlet sign lettered with gold and here a kaleidoscopic effect in the garments of a passer by directly opposite and two stories above their heads a sort of huge loggia one blaze of gilding and crude vermilions opened in the gray cement of a crumbling facade like a sudden burst of flame gigantic pot bellied lanterns of red and gold swung from its ceiling while along its railing stood a row of pots brass ruddy bronze and blue porcelain from which were growing red saffron purple pink and golden tulips without number the air was vibrant with unfamiliar noises from one of the balconies near at hand though unseen a gong a pipe and some kind of stringed instrument wailed and thundered in unison there was a vast shuffling of padded soles and a continuous interchange of singsong monosyllables high pitched and staccato while from every hand rose the strange aromas of the east sandalwood punk incense oil and the smell of mysterious cookery chinatown exclaimed travis i hadn't the faintest idea we had come up so far condy rivers do you know what time it is she pointed a white kid finger through the doorway of a drug store where amid lacquer boxes and bronze urns of herbs and dried seeds a round seth thomas marked half past two and your lunch cried condy great heavens i never thought it's too late to get any at home never mind i'll go somewhere and have a cup of tea why not get a package of chinese tea now that you're down here and take it home with you or drink it here where in one of the restaurants there wouldn't be a soul there at this hour i know they serve tea any time condy let's try it wouldn't it be fun condy smote his thigh fun he vociferated fun it is by jove it would be heavenly wait a moment i'll tell you what we will do tea won't be enough we'll go down to kearney street or to the market and get some crackers to go with it they hurried back to the california market a few blocks distant and bought some crackers and a wedge of new cheese on the way back to chinatown travis stopped at a music store on kearney street to get her banjo which she had left to have its head tightened and thus burdened they regained the town condy grieving audibly at having to carry brown paper bundles through the street first catch your restaurant said travis as they turned into dupont street with its thronging coolies and swarming gayly clad children but they had not far to seek here you are suddenly exclaimed condy halting in front of a wholesale tea house bearing a sign in chinese and english come on travis they ascended two flights of a broad brass bound staircase leading up from the ground floor and gained the restaurant on the top story of the"
