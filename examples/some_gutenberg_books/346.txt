"1" "always intended to marry canute someday anyway she grew tired of crying and looking into the fire so she got up and began to look about her she had heard queer tales about the inside of canute's shanty and her curiosity soon got the better of her rage one of the first things she noticed was the new black suit of clothes hanging on the wall she was dull but it did not take a vain woman long to interpret anything so decidedly flattering and she was pleased in spite of herself as she looked through the cupboard the general air of neglect and discomfort made her pity the man who lived there poor fellow no wonder he wants to get married to get somebody to wash up his dishes batchin's pretty hard on a man it is easy to pity when once one's vanity has been tickled she looked at the windowsill and gave a little shudder and wondered if the man were crazy then she sat down again and sat a long time wondering what her dick and ole would do it is queer dick didn't come right over after me he surely came for he would have left town before the storm began and he might just as well come right on as go back if he'd hurried he would have gotten here before the preacher came i suppose he was afraid to come for he knew canuteson could pound him to jelly the coward her eyes flashed angrily the weary hours wore on and lena began to grow horribly lonesome it was an uncanny night and this was an uncanny place to be in she could hear the coyotes howling hungrily a little way from the cabin and more terrible still were all the unknown noises of the storm she remembered the tales they told of the big log overhead and she was afraid of those snaky things on the windowsills she remembered the man who had been killed in the draw and she wondered what she would do if she saw crazy lou's white face glaring into the window the rattling of the door became unbearable she thought the latch must be loose and took the lamp to look at it then for the first time she saw the ugly brown snake skins whose death rattle sounded every time the wind jarred the door canute canute she screamed in terror outside the door she heard a heavy sound as of a big dog getting up and shaking himself the door opened and canute stood before her white as a snow drift what is it he asked kindly i am cold she faltered he went out and got an armful of wood and a basket of cobs and filled the stove then he went out and lay in the snow before the door presently he heard her calling again what is it he said sitting up i'm so lonesome i'm afraid to stay in here all alone i will go over and get your mother and he got up she won't come i'll bring her said canute grimly no no i don't want her she will scold all the time well i will bring your father she spoke again and it seemed as though her mouth was close up to the key hole she spoke lower than he had ever heard her speak before so low that he had to put his ear up to the lock to hear her i don't want him either canute i'd rather have you for a moment she heard no noise at all then something like a groan with a cry of fear she opened the door and saw canute stretched in the snow at her feet his face in his hands sobbing on the doorstep eric hermannson's soul it was a great night at the lone star schoolhouse a night when the spirit was present with power and when god was very near to man so it seemed to asa skinner servant of god and free gospeller the schoolhouse was crowded with the saved and sanctified robust men and women trembling and quailing before the power of some mysterious psychic force here and there among this cowering sweating multitude crouched some poor wretch who had felt the pangs of an awakened conscience but had not yet experienced that complete divestment of reason that frenzy born of a convulsion of the mind which in the parlance of the free gospellers is termed the light on the floor before the mourners bench lay the unconscious figure of a man in whom outraged nature had sought her last resort this trance state is the highest evidence of grace among the free gospellers and indicates a close walking with god before the desk stood asa skinner shouting of the mercy and vengeance of god and in his eyes shone a terrible earnestness an almost prophetic flame asa was a converted train gambler who used to run between omaha and denver he was a man made for the extremes of life from the most debauched of men he had become the most ascetic his was a bestial face a face that bore the stamp of nature's eternal injustice the forehead was low projecting over the eyes and the sandy hair was plastered down over it and then brushed back at an abrupt right angle the chin was heavy the nostrils were low and wide and the lower lip hung loosely except in his moments of spasmodic earnestness when it shut like a steel trap yet about those coarse features there were deep rugged furrows the scars of many a hand to hand struggle with the weakness of the flesh and about that drooping lip were sharp strenuous lines that had conquered it and taught it to pray over those seamed cheeks there was a certain pallor a greyness caught from many a vigil it was as though after nature had done her worst with that face some fine chisel had gone over it chastening and almost transfiguring it tonight as his muscles twitched with emotion and the perspiration dropped from his hair and chin there was a certain convincing power in the man for asa skinner was a man possessed of a belief of that sentiment of the sublime before which all inequalities are leveled that transport of conviction which seems superior to all laws of condition under which debauchees have become martyrs which made a tinker an artist and a camel driver the founder of an empire this was with asa skinner tonight as he stood proclaiming the vengeance of god it might have occurred to an impartial observer that asa skinner's god was indeed a vengeful god if he could reserve vengeance for those of his creatures who were packed into the lone star schoolhouse that night poor exiles of all nations men from the south and the north peasants from almost every country of europe most of them from the mountainous night bound coast of norway honest men for the most part but men with whom the world had dealt hardly the failures of all countries men sobered by toil and saddened by exile who had been driven to fight for the dominion of an untoward soil to sow where others should gather the advance guard of a mighty civilization to be never had asa skinner spoken more earnestly than now he felt that the lord had this night a special work for him to do tonight eric hermannson the wildest lad on all the divide sat in his audience with a fiddle on his knee just as he had dropped in on his way to play for some dance the violin is an object of particular abhorrence to the free gospellers their antagonism to the church organ is bitter enough but the fiddle they regard as a very incarnation of evil desires singing forever of worldly pleasures and inseparably associated with all forbidden things eric hermannson had long been the object of the prayers of the revivalists his mother had felt the power of the spirit weeks ago and special prayer meetings had been held at her house for her son but eric had only gone his ways laughing the ways of youth which are short enough at best and none too flowery on the divide he slipped away from the prayer meetings to meet the campbell boys in genereau's saloon or hug the plump little french girls at chevalier's dances and sometimes of a summer night he even went across the dewy cornfields and through the wild plum thicket to play the fiddle for lena hanson whose name was a reproach through all the divide country where the women are usually too plain and too busy and too tired to depart from the ways of virtue on such occasions lena attired in a pink wrapper and silk stockings and tiny pink slippers would sing to him accompanying herself on a battered guitar it gave him a delicious sense of freedom and experience to be with a woman who no matter how had lived in big cities and knew the ways of town folk who had never worked in the fields and had kept her hands white and soft her throat fair and tender who had heard great singers in denver and salt lake and who knew the strange language of flattery and idleness and mirth yet careless as he seemed the frantic prayers of his mother were not altogether without their effect upon eric for days he had been fleeing before them as a criminal from his pursuers and over his pleasures had fallen the shadow of something dark and terrible that dogged his steps the harder he danced the louder he sang the more was he conscious that this phantom was gaining upon him that in time it would track him down one sunday afternoon late in the fall when he had been drinking beer with lena hanson and listening to a song which made his cheeks burn a rattlesnake had crawled out of the side of the sod house and thrust its ugly head in under the screen door he was not afraid of snakes but he knew enough of gospellism to feel the significance of the reptile lying coiled there upon her doorstep his lips were cold when he kissed lena goodbye and he went there no more the final barrier between eric and his mother's faith was his violin and to that he clung as a man sometimes will cling to his dearest sin to the weakness more precious to him than all his strength in the great world beauty comes to men in many guises and art in a hundred forms but for eric there was only his violin it stood to him for all the manifestations of art it was his only bridge into the kingdom of the soul it was to eric hermannson that the evangelist directed his impassioned pleading that night _saul saul why persecutest thou me is there a saul here tonight who has stopped his ears to that gentle pleading who has thrust a spear into that bleeding side think of it my brother you are offered this wonderful love and you prefer the worm that dieth not and the fire which will not be quenched what right have you to lose one of god's precious souls _saul saul why persecutest thou me a great joy dawned in asa skinner's pale face for he saw that eric hermannson was swaying to and fro in his seat the minister fell upon his knees and threw his long arms up over his head o my brothers i feel it coming the blessing we have prayed for i tell you the spirit is coming just a little more prayer brothers a little more zeal and he will be here i can feel his cooling wing upon my brow glory be to god forever and ever amen the whole congregation groaned under the pressure of this spiritual panic shouts and hallelujahs went up from every lip another figure fell prostrate upon the floor from the mourners bench rose a chant of terror and rapture eating honey and drinking wine _glory to the bleeding lamb i am my lord's and he is mine _glory to the bleeding lamb the hymn was sung in a dozen dialects and voiced all the vague yearning of these hungry lives of these people who had starved all the passions so long only to fall victims to the barest of them all fear a groan of ultimate anguish rose from eric hermannson's bowed head and the sound was like the groan of a great tree when it falls in the forest the minister rose suddenly to his feet and threw back his head crying in a loud voice _lazarus come forth eric hermannson you are lost going down at sea in the name of god and jesus christ his son i throw you the life line take hold almighty god my soul for his the minister threw his arms out and lifted his quivering face eric hermannson rose to his feet his lips were set and the lightning was in his eyes he took his violin by the neck and crushed it to splinters across his knee and to asa skinner the sound was like the shackles of sin broken audibly asunder ii for more than two years eric hermannson kept the austere faith to which he had sworn himself kept it until a girl from the east came to spend a week on the nebraska divide she was a girl of other manners and conditions and there were greater distances between her life and eric's than all the miles which separated rattlesnake creek from new york city indeed she had no business to be in the west at all but ah across what leagues of land and sea by what improbable chances do the unrelenting gods bring to us our fate it was in a year of financial depression that wyllis elliot came to nebraska to buy cheap land and revisit the country where he had spent a year of his youth when he had graduated from harvard it was still customary for moneyed gentlemen to send their scapegrace sons to rough it on ranches in the wilds of nebraska or dakota or to consign them to a living death in the sagebrush of the black hills these young men did not always return to the ways of civilized life but wyllis elliot had not married a half breed nor been shot in a cowpunchers brawl nor wrecked by bad whisky nor appropriated by a smirched adventuress he had been saved from these things by a girl his sister who had been very near to his life ever since the days when they read fairy tales together and dreamed the dreams that never come true on this his first visit to his father's ranch since he left it six years before he brought her with him she had been laid up half the winter from a sprain received while skating and had had too much time for reflection during those months she was restless and filled with a desire to see something of the wild country of which her brother had told her so much she was to be married the next winter and wyllis understood her when she begged him to take her with him on this long aimless jaunt across the continent to taste the last of their freedom together it comes to all women of her type that desire to taste the unknown which allures and terrifies to run one's whole soul's length out to the wind just once it had been an eventful journey wyllis somehow understood that strain of gypsy blood in his sister and he knew where to take her they had slept in sod houses on the platte river made the acquaintance of the personnel of a third rate opera company on the train to deadwood dined in a camp of railroad constructors at the world's end beyond new castle gone through the black hills on horseback fished for trout in dome lake watched a dance at cripple creek where the lost souls who hide in the hills gathered for their besotted revelry and now last of all before the return to thraldom there was this little shack anchored on the windy crest of the divide a little black dot against the flaming sunsets a scented sea of cornland bathed in opalescent air and blinding sunlight margaret elliot was one of those women of whom there are so many in this day when old order passing giveth place to new beautiful talented critical unsatisfied tired of the world at twenty four for the moment the life and people of the divide interested her she was there but a week perhaps had she stayed longer that inexorable ennui which travels faster even than the vestibule limited would have overtaken her the week she tarried there was the week that eric hermannson was helping jerry lockhart thresh a week earlier or a week later and there would have been no story to write it was on thursday and they were to leave on saturday wyllis and his sister were sitting on the wide piazza of the ranchhouse staring out into the afternoon sunlight and protesting against the gusts of hot wind that blew up from the sandy riverbottom twenty miles to the southward the young man pulled his cap lower over his eyes and remarked this wind is the real thing you don't strike it anywhere else you remember we had a touch of it in algiers and i told you it came from kansas it's the keynote of this country wyllis touched her hand that lay on the hammock and continued gently i hope it's paid you sis roughing it's dangerous business it takes the taste out of things she shut her fingers firmly over the brown hand that was so like her own paid why wyllis i haven't been so happy since we were children and were going to discover the ruins of troy together some day do you know i believe i could just stay on here forever and let the world go on its own gait it seems as though the tension and strain we used to talk of last winter were gone for good as though one could never give one's strength out to such petty things any more wyllis brushed the ashes of his pipe away from the silk handkerchief that was knotted about his neck and stared moodily off at the skyline no you're mistaken this would bore you after a while you can't shake the fever of the other life i've tried it there was a time when the gay fellows of rome could trot down into the thebaid and burrow into the sandhills and get rid of it but it's all too complex now you see we've made our dissipations so dainty and respectable that they've gone further in than the flesh and taken hold of the ego proper you couldn't rest even here the war cry would follow you you don't waste words wyllis but you never miss fire i talk more than you do without saying half so much you must have learned the art of silence from these taciturn norwegians i think i like silent men naturally said wyllis since you have decided to marry the most brilliant talker you know both were silent for a time listening to the sighing of the hot wind through the parched morning glory vines margaret spoke first tell me wyllis were many of the norwegians you used to know as interesting as eric hermannson who siegfried well no he used to be the flower of the norwegian youth in my day and he's rather an exception even now he has retrograded though the bonds of the soil have tightened on him i fancy siegfried come that's rather good wyllis he looks like a dragon slayer what is it that makes him so different from the others i can talk to him he seems quite like a human being well said wyllis meditatively i don't read bourget as much as my cultured sister and i'm not so well up in analysis but i fancy it's because one keeps cherishing a perfectly unwarranted suspicion that under that big hulking anatomy of his he may conceal a soul somewhere _nicht wahr something like that said margaret thoughtfully except that it's more than a suspicion and it isn't groundless he has one and he makes it known somehow without speaking i always have my doubts about loquacious souls wyllis remarked with the unbelieving smile that had grown habitual with him margaret went on not heeding the interruption i knew it from the first when he told me about the suicide of his cousin the bernstein boy that kind of blunt pathos can't be summoned at will in anybody the earlier novelists rose to it sometimes unconsciously but last night when i sang for him i was doubly sure oh i haven't told you about that yet better light your pipe again you see he stumbled in on me in the dark when i was pumping away at that old parlour organ to please mrs lockhart it's her household fetish and i've forgotten how many pounds of butter she made and sold to buy it well eric stumbled in and in some inarticulate manner made me understand that he wanted me to sing for him i sang just the old things of course it's queer to sing familiar things here at the world's end it makes one think how the hearts of men have carried them around the world into the wastes of iceland and the jungles of africa and the islands of the pacific i think if one lived here long enough one would quite forget how to be trivial and would read only the great books that we never get time to read in the world and would remember only the great music and the things that are really worth while would stand out clearly against that horizon over there and of course i played the intermezzo from _cavalleria rusticana_ for him it goes rather better on an organ than most things do he shuffled his feet and twisted his big hands up into knots and blurted out that he didn't know there was any music like that in the world why there were tears in his voice wyllis yes like rossetti i _heard_ his tears then it dawned upon me that it was probably the first good music he had ever heard in all his life think of it to care for music as he does and never to hear it never to know that it exists on earth to long for it as we long for other perfect experiences that never come i can't tell you what music means to that man i never saw any one so susceptible to it it gave him speech he became alive when i had finished the intermezzo he began telling me about a little crippled brother who died and whom he loved and used to carry everywhere in his arms he did not wait for encouragement he took up the story and told it slowly as if to himself just sort of rose up and told his own woe to answer mascagni's it overcame me poor devil said wyllis looking at her with mysterious eyes and so you've given him a new woe now he'll go on wanting grieg and schubert the rest of his days and never getting them that's a girl's philanthropy for you jerry lockhart came out of the house screwing his chin over the unusual luxury of a stiff white collar which his wife insisted upon as a necessary article of toilet while miss elliot was at the house jerry sat down on the step and smiled his broad red smile at margaret well i've got the music for your dance miss elliot olaf oleson will bring his accordion and mollie will play the organ when she isn't lookin after the grub and a little chap from frenchtown will bring his fiddle though the french don't mix with the norwegians much delightful mr lockhart that dance will be the feature of our trip and it's so nice of you to get it up for us we'll see the norwegians in character at last cried margaret cordially see here lockhart i'll settle with you for backing her in this scheme said wyllis sitting up and knocking the ashes out of his pipe she's done crazy things enough on this trip but to talk of dancing all night with a gang of half mad norwegians and taking the carriage at four to catch the six o'clock train out of riverton well it's tommyrot that's what it is wyllis i leave it to your sovereign power of reason to decide whether it isn't easier to stay up all night than to get up at three in the morning to get up at three think what that means no sir i prefer to keep my vigil and then get into a sleeper but what do you want with the norwegians i thought you were tired of dancing so i am with some people but i want to see a norwegian dance and i intend to come wyllis you know how seldom it is that one really wants to do anything nowadays i wonder when i have really wanted to go to a party before it will be something to remember next month at newport when we have to and don't want to remember your own theory that contrast is about the only thing that makes life endurable this is my party and mr lockhart's your whole duty tomorrow night will consist in being nice to the norwegian girls i'll warrant you were adept enough at it once and you'd better be very nice indeed for if there are many such young valkyries as eric's sister among them they would simply tie you up in a knot if they suspected you were guying them wyllis groaned and sank back into the hammock to consider his fate while his sister went on and the guests mr lockhart did they accept lockhart took out his knife and began sharpening it on the sole of his plowshoe well i guess we'll have a couple dozen you see it's pretty hard to get a crowd together here any more most of em have gone over to the free gospellers and they'd rather put their feet in the fire than shake em to a fiddle margaret made a gesture of impatience those free gospellers have just cast an evil spell over this country haven't they well said lockhart cautiously i don't just like to pass judgment on any christian sect but if you're to know the chosen by their works the gospellers can't make a very proud showin an that's a fact they're responsible for a few suicides and they've sent a good sized delegation to the state insane asylum an i don't see as they've made the rest of us much better than we were before i had a little herdboy last spring as square a little dane as i want to work for me but after the gospellers got hold of him and sanctified him the little beggar used to get down on his knees out on the prairie and pray by the hour and let the cattle get into the corn an i had to fire him that's about the way it goes now there's eric that chap used to be a hustler and the spryest dancer in all this section called all the dances now he's got no ambition and he's glum as a preacher i don't suppose we can even get him to come in tomorrow night eric why he must dance we can't let him off said margaret quickly why i intend to dance with him myself i'm afraid he won't dance i asked him this morning if he'd help us out and he said i don't dance now any more said lockhart imitating the laboured english of the norwegian the miller of hofbau the miller of hofbau o my princess chirped wyllis cheerfully from his hammock the red on his sister's cheek deepened a little and she laughed mischievously we'll see about that sir i'll not admit that i am beaten until i have asked him myself every night eric rode over to st anne a little village in the heart of the french settlement for the mail as the road lay through the most attractive part of the divide country on several occasions margaret elliot and her brother had accompanied him tonight wyllis had business with lockhart and margaret rode with eric mounted on a frisky little mustang that mrs lockhart had broken to the sidesaddle margaret regarded her escort very much as she did the servant who always accompanied her on long rides at home and the ride to the village was a silent one she was occupied with thoughts of another world and eric was wrestling with more thoughts than had ever been crowded into his head before he rode with his eyes riveted on that slight figure before him as though he wished to absorb it through the optic nerves and hold it in his brain forever he understood the situation perfectly his brain worked slowly but he had a keen sense of the values of things this girl represented an entirely new species of humanity to him but he knew where to place her the prophets of old when an angel first appeared unto them never doubted its high origin eric was patient"
