"1" "not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that wedding cake might certainly disagree with many perhaps with most people unless taken moderately with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs weston's wedding cake in their hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it chapter iii mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley comprehended many such not unfrequently through emma's persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card table for him real long standing regard brought the westons and mr knightley and by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr woodhouse's drawing room and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away after these came a second set among the most come at able of whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses had it taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance mrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness her youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible and yet she was a happy woman and a woman whom no one named without good will it was her own universal good will and contented temper which worked such wonders she loved every body was interested in every body's happiness quicksighted to every body's merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip mrs goddard was the mistress of a school not of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but a real honest old fashioned boarding school where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education without any danger of coming back prodigies mrs goddard's school was in high repute and very deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church she was a plain motherly kind of woman who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea visit and having formerly owed much to mr woodhouse's kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancy work whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her father's sake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody somebody had placed her several years back at mrs goddard's school and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour boarder this was all that was generally known of her history she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired she was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith's conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement encouragement should be given those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort of people must be doing her harm they were a family of the name of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm of mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwell very creditably she believed she knew mr knightley thought highly of them but they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect _she_ would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests upon such occasions poor mr woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart a _very_ little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to _half_ a glass of wine a _small_ half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last chapter iv harriet smith's intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other as a walking companion emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her in that respect mrs weston's loss had been important her father never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied and since mrs weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant and a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted exactly the something which her home required such a friend as mrs weston was out of the question two such could never be granted two such she did not want it was quite a different sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent mrs weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful for mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents but harriet could not tell she was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain emma was obliged to fancy what she liked but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth harriet had no penetration she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her and looked no farther mrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversation and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey mill farm it must have been the whole but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place emma encouraged her talkativeness amused by such a picture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs martin's having _two_ parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard's drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martin's saying as she was so fond of it it should be called _her_ cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter a son and son's wife who all lived together but when it appeared that the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good nature in doing something or other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin and there was evidently no dislike to it harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured and obliging he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in every thing else he was so very obliging he had his shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her she was very fond of singing he could sing a little himself she believed he was very clever and understood every thing he had a very fine flock and while she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country she believed every body spoke well of him his mother and sisters were very fond of him mrs martin had told her one day and there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he would make a good husband not that she _wanted_ him to marry she was in no hurry at all well done mrs martin thought emma you know what you are about and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send mrs goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose mrs goddard had ever seen mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all _them_ to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can the next question was what sort of looking man is mr martin oh not handsome not at all handsome i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagine his age to be he was four and twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference which is very odd only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter without education to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love the young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriet's side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own they met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the donwell road he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin his appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet's inclination harriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder mr martin looked as if he did not know what manner was they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel as real gentlemen i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man mr knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with _him_ you might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of _them_ compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston's time of life there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss will he indeed that will be very bad how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he _will_ thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ i wonder he did not remember the book was all harriet's answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself she therefore said no more for some time her next beginning was in one respect perhaps mr elton's manners are superior to mr knightley's or mr weston's they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in _him_ because
