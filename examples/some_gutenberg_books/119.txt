"1" "crowded spectators 2 officials advanced who recognized the black dancer and horror and terror spread in the saloon as they said who the supposed knight was it was the executioner of bergen but glowing with rage the king commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death who had ventured to dance with the queen so disgraced the empress and insulted the crown the culpable threw himself at the emperor and said indeed i have heavily sinned against all noble guests assembled here but most heavily against you my sovereign and my queen the queen is insulted by my haughtiness equal to treason but no punishment even blood will not be able to wash out the disgrace which you have suffered by me therefore oh king allow me to propose a remedy to efface the shame and to render it as if not done draw your sword and knight me then i will throw down my gauntlet to everyone who dares to speak disrespectfully of my king the emperor was surprised at this bold proposal however it appeared the wisest to him you are a knave he replied after a moment's consideration however your advice is good and displays prudence as your offense shows adventurous courage well then and gave him the knight stroke so i raise you to nobility who begged for grace for your offense now kneels before me rise as knight knavish you have acted and knave of bergen shall you be called henceforth and gladly the black knight rose three cheers were given in honor of the emperor and loud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the queen danced still once with the knave of bergen chapter ii heidelberg landing a monarch at heidelberg we stopped at a hotel by the railway station next morning as we sat in my room waiting for breakfast to come up we got a good deal interested in something which was going on over the way in front of another hotel first the personage who is called the _portier_ who is not the _porter_ but is a sort of first mate of a hotel 1 see appendix a appeared at the door in a spick and span new blue cloth uniform decorated with shining brass buttons and with bands of gold lace around his cap and wristbands and he wore white gloves too he shed an official glance upon the situation and then began to give orders two women servants came out with pails and brooms and brushes and gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door beyond these we could see some men servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase this carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it then brought back and put down again the brass stair rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there now came some more chamber maids and retouched the sidewalk and afterward wiped the marble steps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone the _portier_ cast his eye along it and found it was not absolutely straight he commanded it to be straightened the servants made the effort made several efforts in fact but the _portier_ was not satisfied he finally had it taken up and then he put it down himself and got it right at this stage of the proceedings a narrow bright red carpet was unrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the curbstone along the center of the black carpet this red path cost the _portier_ more trouble than even the black one had done but he patiently fixed and refixed it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the middle of the black carpet in new york these performances would have gathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators but here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who stood in a row across the pavement some with their school knapsacks on their backs and their hands in their pockets others with arms full of bundles and all absorbed in the show occasionally one of them skipped irreverently over the carpet and took up a position on the other side this always visibly annoyed the _portier_ now came a waiting interval the landlord in plain clothes and bareheaded placed himself on the bottom marble step abreast the _portier_ who stood on the other end of the same steps six or eight waiters gloved bareheaded and wearing their whitest linen their whitest cravats and their finest swallow tails grouped themselves about these chiefs but leaving the carpetway clear nobody moved or spoke any more but only waited in a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard and immediately groups of people began to gather in the street two or three open carriages arrived and deposited some maids of honor and some male officials at the hotel presently another open carriage brought the grand duke of baden a stately man in uniform who wore the handsome brass mounted steel spiked helmet of the army on his head last came the empress of germany and the grand duchess of baden in a closed carriage these passed through the low bowing groups of servants and disappeared in the hotel exhibiting to us only the backs of their heads and then the show was over it appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a ship but as to heidelberg the weather was growing pretty warm very warm in fact so we left the valley and took quarters at the schloss hotel on the hill above the castle heidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge a gorge the shape of a shepherd's crook if one looks up it he perceives that it is about straight for a mile and a half then makes a sharp curve to the right and disappears this gorge along whose bottom pours the swift neckar is confined between or cloven through a couple of long steep ridges a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits with the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under cultivation these ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge and form two bold and conspicuous headlands with heidelberg nestling between them from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the rhine valley and into this expanse the neckar goes wandering in shining curves and is presently lost to view now if one turns and looks up the gorge once more he will see the schloss hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the neckar a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with foliage that no glimpse of the rock appears the building seems very airily situated it has the appearance of being on a shelf half way up the wooded mountainside and as it is remote and isolated and very white it makes a strong mark against the lofty leafy rampart at its back this hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty and one which might be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a commanding situation this feature may be described as a series of glass enclosed parlors _clinging to the outside of the house_ one against each and every bed chamber and drawing room they are like long narrow high ceiled bird cages hung against the building my room was a corner room and had two of these things a north one and a west one from the north cage one looks up the neckar gorge from the west one he looks down it this last affords the most extensive view and it is one of the loveliest that can be imagined too out of a billowy upheaval of vivid green foliage a rifle shot removed rises the huge ruin of heidelberg castle 2 see appendix b with empty window arches ivy mailed battlements moldering towers the lear of inanimate nature deserted discrowned beaten by the storms but royal still and beautiful it is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly strike the leafy declivity at the castle's base and dash up it and drench it as with a luminous spray while the adjacent groves are in deep shadow behind the castle swells a great dome shaped hill forest clad and beyond that a nobler and loftier one the castle looks down upon the compact brown roofed town and from the town two picturesque old bridges span the river now the view broadens through the gateway of the sentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide rhine plain which stretches away softly and richly tinted grows gradually and dreamily indistinct and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon i have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm about it as this one gives the first night we were there we went to bed and to sleep early but i awoke at the end of two or three hours and lay a comfortable while listening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony windows i took it to be rain but it turned out to be only the murmur of the restless neckar tumbling over her dikes and dams far below in the gorge i got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful sight away down on the level under the black mass of the castle the town lay stretched along the river its intricate cobweb of streets jeweled with twinkling lights there were rows of lights on the bridges these flung lances of light upon the water in the black shadows of the arches and away at the extremity of all this fairy spectacle blinked and glowed a massed multitude of gas jets which seemed to cover acres of ground it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread out there i did not know before that a half mile of sextuple railway tracks could be made such an adornment one thinks heidelberg by day with its surroundings is the last possibility of the beautiful but when he sees heidelberg by night a fallen milky way with that glittering railway constellation pinned to the border he requires time to consider upon the verdict one never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all these lofty neckar hills to their tops the great deeps of a boundless forest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country but german legends and fairy tales have given these an added charm they have peopled all that region with gnomes and dwarfs and all sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures at the time i am writing of i had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes i was not sure but i was beginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as realities one afternoon i got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel and presently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk and kobolds and enchanted folk and the rest of the pleasant legendary stuff and so by stimulating my fancy i finally got to imagining i glimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the columned aisles of the forest it was a place which was peculiarly meet for the occasion it was a pine wood with so thick and soft a carpet of brown needles that one's footfall made no more sound than if he were treading on wool the tree trunks were as round and straight and smooth as pillars and stood close together they were bare of branches to a point about twenty five feet above ground and from there upward so thick with boughs that not a ray of sunlight could pierce through the world was bright with sunshine outside but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in there and also a deep silence so profound that i seemed to hear my own breathings when i had stood ten minutes thinking and imagining and getting my spirit in tune with the place and in the right mood to enjoy the supernatural a raven suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head it made me start and then i was angry because i started i looked up and the creature was sitting on a limb right over me looking down at me i felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which one feels when he finds that a human stranger has been clandestinely inspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him i eyed the raven and the raven eyed me nothing was said during some seconds then the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point of observation lifted his wings stuck his head far down below his shoulders toward me and croaked again a croak with a distinctly insulting expression about it if he had spoken in english he could not have said any more plainly than he did say in raven well what do _you_ want here i felt as foolish as if i had been caught in some mean act by a responsible being and reproved for it however i made no reply i would not bandy words with a raven the adversary waited a while with his shoulders still lifted his head thrust down between them and his keen bright eye fixed on me then he threw out two or three more insults which i could not understand further than that i knew a portion of them consisted of language not used in church i still made no reply now the adversary raised his head and called there was an answering croak from a little distance in the wood evidently a croak of inquiry the adversary explained with enthusiasm and the other raven dropped everything and came the two sat side by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as two great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug the thing became more and more embarrassing they called in another friend this was too much i saw that they had the advantage of me and so i concluded to get out of the scrape by walking out of it they enjoyed my defeat as much as any low white people could have done they craned their necks and laughed at me for a raven _can_ laugh just like a man they squalled insulting remarks after me as long as they could see me they were nothing but ravens i knew that what they thought of me could be a matter of no consequence and yet when even a raven shouts after you what a hat oh pull down your vest and that sort of thing it hurts you and humiliates you and there is no getting around it with fine reasoning and pretty arguments animals talk to each other of course there can be no question about that but i suppose there are very few people who can understand them i never knew but one man who could i knew he could however because he told me so himself he was a middle aged simple hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner of california among the woods and mountains a good many years and had studied the ways of his only neighbors the beasts and the birds until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made this was jim baker according to jim baker some animals have only a limited education and some use only simple words and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure whereas certain other animals have a large vocabulary a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery consequently these latter talk a great deal they like it they are so conscious of their talent and they enjoy showing off baker said that after long and careful observation he had come to the conclusion that the bluejays were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts said he there's more _to_ a bluejay than any other creature he has got more moods and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures and mind you whatever a bluejay feels he can put into language and no mere commonplace language either but rattling out and out book talk and bristling with metaphor too just bristling and as for command of language why _you_ never see a bluejay get stuck for a word no man ever did they just boil out of him and another thing i've noticed a good deal and there's no bird or cow or anything that uses as good grammar as a bluejay you may say a cat uses good grammar well a cat does but you let a cat get excited once you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed nights and you'll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw ignorant people think it's the _noise_ which fighting cats make that is so aggravating but it ain't so it's the sickening grammar they use now i've never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom and when they do they are as ashamed as a human they shut right down and leave you may call a jay a bird well so he is in a measure but he's got feathers on him and don't belong to no church perhaps but otherwise he is just as much human as you be and i'll tell you for why a jay's gifts and instincts and feelings and interests cover the whole ground a jay hasn't got any more principle than a congressman a jay will lie a jay will steal a jay will deceive a jay will betray and four times out of five a jay will go back on his solemnest promise the sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you can't cram into no bluejay's head now on top of all this there's another thing a jay can out swear any gentleman in the mines you think a cat can swear well a cat can but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his reserve powers and where is your cat don't talk to _me_ i know too much about this thing in the one little particular of scolding just good clean out and out scolding a bluejay can lay over anything human or divine yes sir a jay is everything that a man is a jay can cry a jay can laugh a jay can feel shame a jay can reason and plan and discuss a jay likes gossip and scandal a jay has got a sense of humor a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do maybe better if a jay ain't human he better take in his sign that's all now i'm going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays chapter iii baker's bluejay yarn what stumped the blue jays when i first begun to understand jay language correctly there was a little incident happened here seven years ago the last man in this region but me moved away there stands his house been empty ever since a log house with a plank roof just one big room and no more no ceiling nothing between the rafters and the floor well one sunday morning i was sitting out here in front of my cabin with my cat taking the sun and looking at the blue hills and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees and thinking of the home away yonder in the states that i hadn't heard from in thirteen years when a bluejay lit on that house with an acorn in his mouth and says hello i reckon i've struck something when he spoke the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof of course but he didn't care his mind was all on the thing he had struck it was a knot hole in the roof he cocked his head to one side shut one eye and put the other one to the hole like a possum looking down a jug then he glanced up with his bright eyes gave a wink or two with his wings which signifies gratification you understand and says it looks like a hole it's located like a hole blamed if i don't believe it _is_ a hole then he cocked his head down and took another look he glances up perfectly joyful this time winks his wings and his tail both and says oh no this ain't no fat thing i reckon if i ain't in luck why it's a perfectly elegant hole so he flew down and got that acorn and fetched it up and dropped it in and was just tilting his head back with the heavenliest smile on his face when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor and the queerest look of surprise took its place then he says why i didn't hear it fall he cocked his eye at the hole again and took a long look raised up and shook his head stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side shook his head again he studied a while then he just went into the details walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass no use now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute and finally says well it's too many for _me_ that's certain must be a mighty long hole however i ain't got no time to fool around here i got to tend to business i reckon it's all right chance it anyway so he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it but he was too late he held his eye there as much as a minute then he raised up and sighed and says confound it i don't seem to understand this thing no way however i'll tackle her again he fetched another acorn and done his level best to see what become of it but he couldn't he says well i never struck no such a hole as this before i'm of the opinion it's a totally new kind of a hole then he begun to get mad he held in for a spell walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself but his feelings got the upper hand of him presently and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face i never see a bird take on so about a little thing when he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute then he says well you're a long hole and a deep hole and a mighty singular hole altogether but i've started in to fill you and i'm damned if i _don't_ fill you if it takes a hundred years and with that away he went you never see a bird work so since you was born he laid into his work like a nigger and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles i ever struck he never stopped to take a look anymore he just hove em in and went for more well at last he could hardly flop his wings he was so tuckered out he comes a dropping down once more sweating like an ice pitcher dropped his acorn in and says _now_ i guess i've got the bulge on you by this time so he bent down for a look if you'll believe me when his head come up again he was just pale with rage he says i've shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years and if i can see a sign of one of em i wish i may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes he just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his back agin the chimbly and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind i see in a second that what i had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments as you may say another jay was going by and heard him doing his devotions and stops to inquire what was up the sufferer told him the whole circumstance and says now yonder's the hole and if you don't believe me go and look for yourself so this fellow went and looked and comes back and says how many did you say you put in there not any less than two tons says the sufferer the other jay went and looked again he couldn't seem to make it out so he raised a yell and three more jays come they all examined the hole they all made the sufferer tell it over again then they all discussed it and got off as many leather headed opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done they called in more jays then more and more till pretty soon this whole region peared to have a blue flush about it there must have been five thousand of them and such another jawing and disputing and ripping and cussing you never heard every jay in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more chuckle headed opinion about the mystery than the jay that went there before him they examined the house all over too the door was standing half open and at last one old jay happened to go and light on it and look in of course that knocked the mystery galley west in a second there lay the acorns scattered all over the floor he flopped his wings and raised a whoop come here he says come here everybody hang'd if this fool hasn't been trying to fill up a house with acorns they all came a swooping down like a blue cloud and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance the whole absurdity of the contract that that first jay had tackled hit him home and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter and the next jay took his place and done the same well sir they roosted around here on the housetop and the trees for an hour and guffawed over that thing like human beings it ain't any use to tell me a bluejay hasn't got a sense of humor because i know better and memory too they brought jays here from all over the united states to look down that hole every summer for three years other birds too and they could all see the point except an owl that come from nova scotia to visit the yo semite and he took this thing in on his way back he said he couldn't see anything funny in it but then he was a good deal disappointed about yo semite too chapter iv student life the laborious beer king the summer semester was in full tide consequently the most frequent figure in and about heidelberg was the student most of the students were germans of course but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous they hailed from every corner of the globe for instruction is cheap in heidelberg and so is living too the anglo american club composed of british and american students had twenty five members and there was still much material left to draw from nine tenths of the heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform the other tenth wore caps of various colors and belonged to social organizations called corps there were five corps each with a color of its own there were white caps blue caps and red yellow and green ones the famous duel fighting is confined to the corps boys the _kneip_ seems to be a specialty of theirs too kneips are held now and then to celebrate great occasions like the election of a beer king for instance the solemnity is simple the five corps assemble at night and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer out of pint mugs as fast as possible and each man keeps his own count usually by laying aside a lucifer match for each mug he empties the election is soon decided when the candidates can hold no more a count is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is proclaimed king i was told that the last beer king elected by the corps or by his own capabilities emptied his mug seventy five times no"
