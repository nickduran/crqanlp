"1" "the idea into your head that a fool thing you call pride is going to cut us out of all the pleasure we have in life beside ourselves uncle wesley you are a dear said elnora just a dear if i can't possibly get that money any way else on earth i'll come and borrow it of you and then i'll pay it back if i must dig ferns from the swamp and sell them from door to door in the city i'll even plant them so that they will be sure to come up in the spring i have been sort of panic stricken all day and couldn't think i can gather nuts and sell them freckles sold moths and butterflies and i've a lot collected of course i am going back to morrow i can find a way to get the books don't you worry about me i am all right now what do you think of that inquired wesley sinton of the swamp in general here's our elnora come back to stay head high and right as a trivet you've named three ways in three minutes that you could earn ten dollars which i figure would be enough to start you let's go to supper and stop worrying elnora unlocked the case took out the pail put the napkin in it pulled the ribbon from her hair binding it down tightly again and followed to the road from afar she could see her mother in the doorway she blinked her eyes and tried to smile as she answered wesley sinton and indeed she did feel better she knew now what she had to expect where to go and what to do get the books she must when she had them she would show those city girls and boys how to prepare and recite lessons how to walk with a brave heart and they could show her how to wear pretty clothes and have good times as she neared the door her mother reached for the pail i forgot to tell you to bring home your scraps for the chickens she said elnora entered there weren't any scraps and i'm hungry again as i ever was in my life i thought likely you would be said mrs comstock and so i got supper ready we can eat first and do the work afterward what kept you so i expected you an hour ago elnora looked into her mother's face and smiled it was a queer sort of a little smile and would have reached the depths with any normal mother i see you've been bawling said mrs comstock i thought you'd get your fill in a hurry that's why i wouldn't go to any expense if we keep out of the poor house we have to cut the corners close it's likely this brushwood road tax will eat up all we've saved in years where the land tax is to come from i don't know it gets bigger every year if they are going to dredge the swamp ditch again they'll just have to take the land to pay for it i can't that's all we'll get up early in the morning and gather and hull the beans for winter and put in the rest of the day hoeing the turnips elnora again smiled that pitiful smile do you think i didn't know that i was funny and would be laughed at she asked funny cried mrs comstock hotly yes funny a regular caricature answered elnora no one else wore calico not even one other no one else wore high heavy shoes not even one no one else had such a funny little old hat my hair was not right my ribbon invisible compared with the others i did not know where to go or what to do and i had no books what a spectacle i made for them elnora laughed nervously at her own picture but there are always two sides the professor said in the algebra class that he never had a better solution and explanation than mine of the proposition he gave me which scored one for me in spite of my clothes well i wouldn't brag on myself that was poor taste admitted elnora but you see it is a case of whistling to keep up my courage i honestly could see that i would have looked just as well as the rest of them if i had been dressed as they were we can't afford that so i have to find something else to brace me it was rather bad mother well i'm glad you got enough of it oh but i haven't hurried in elnora i just got a start the hardest is over to morrow they won't be surprised they will know what to expect i am sorry to hear about the dredge is it really going through yes i got my notification today the tax will be something enormous i don't know as i can spare you even if you are willing to be a laughing stock for the town with every bite elnora's courage returned for she was a healthy young thing you've heard about doing evil that good might come from it she said well mother mine it's something like that with me i'm willing to bear the hard part to pay for what i'll learn already i have selected the ward building in which i shall teach in about four years i am going to ask for a room with a south exposure so that the flowers and moths i take in from the swamp to show the children will do well you little idiot said mrs comstock how are you going to pay your expenses now that is just what i was going to ask you said elnora you see i have had two startling pieces of news to day i did not know i would need any money i thought the city furnished the books and there is an out of town tuition also i need ten dollars in the morning will you please let me have it ten dollars cried mrs comstock ten dollars why don't you say a hundred and be done with it i could get one as easy as the other i told you i told you i couldn't raise a cent every year expenses grow bigger and bigger i told you not to ask for money i never meant to replied elnora i thought clothes were all i needed and i could bear them i never knew about buying books and tuition well i did said mrs comstock i knew what you would run into but you are so bull dog stubborn and so set in your way i thought i would just let you try the world a little and see how you liked it elnora pushed back her chair and looked at her mother do you mean to say she demanded that you knew when you let me go into a city classroom and reveal the fact before all of them that i expected to have my books handed out to me do you mean to say that you knew i had to pay for them mrs comstock evaded the direct question anybody but an idiot mooning over a book or wasting time prowling the woods would have known you had to pay everybody has to pay for everything life is made up of pay pay pay it's always and forever pay if you don't pay one way you do another of course i knew you had to pay of course i knew you would come home blubbering but you don't get a penny i haven't one cent and can't get one have your way if you are determined but i think you will find the road somewhat rocky swampy you mean mother corrected elnora she arose white and trembling perhaps some day god will teach me how to understand you he knows i do not now you can't possibly realize just what you let me go through to day or how you let me go but i'll tell you this you understand enough that if you had the money and would offer it to me i wouldn't touch it now and i'll tell you this much more i'll get it myself i'll raise it and do it some honest way i am going back to morrow the next day and the next you need not come out i'll do the night work and hoe the turnips it was ten o'clock when the chickens pigs and cattle were fed the turnips hoed and a heap of bean vines was stacked beside the back door chapter ii wherein wesley and margaret go shopping and elnora's wardrobe is replenished wesley sinton walked down the road half a mile and turned at the lane leading to his home his heart was hot and filled with indignation he had told elnora he did not blame her mother but he did his wife met him at the door did you see anything of elnora she questioned most too much maggie he answered what do you say to going to town there's a few things has to be got right away where did you see her wesley along the old limberlost trail my girl torn to pieces sobbing her courage always has been fine but the thing she met to day was too much for her we ought to have known better than to let her go that way it wasn't only clothes there were books and entrance fees for out of town people that she didn't know about while there must have been jeers whispers and laughing maggie i feel as if i'd been a traitor to those girls of ours i ought to have gone in and seen about this school business don't cry maggie get me some supper and i'll hitch up and see what we can do now what can we do wesley i don't just know but we've got to do something kate comstock will be a handful while elnora will be two but between us we must see that the girl is not too hard pressed about money and that she is dressed so she is not ridiculous she's saved us the wages of a woman many a day can't you make her some decent dresses well i'm not just what you call expert but i could beat kate comstock all to pieces i know that skirts should be pleated to the band instead of gathered and full enough to sit in and short enough to walk in i could try there are patterns for sale let's go right away wesley set me a bit of supper while i hitch up margaret built a fire made coffee and fried ham and eggs she set out pie and cake and had enough for a hungry man by the time the carriage was at the door but she had no appetite she dressed while wesley ate put away the food while he dressed and then they drove toward the city through the beautiful september evening and as they went they planned for elnora the trouble was not whether they were generous enough to buy what she needed but whether she would accept their purchases and what her mother would say they went to a drygoods store and when a clerk asked what they wanted to see neither of them knew so they stepped aside and held a whispered consultation what had we better get wesley dresses said wesley promptly but how many dresses and what kind blest if i know exclaimed wesley i thought you would manage that i know about some things i'm going to get at that instant several high school girls came into the store and approached them there exclaimed wesley breathlessly there maggie like them that's what she needs buy like they have margaret stared what did they wear they were rapidly passing they seemed to have so much and she could not decide so quickly before she knew it she was among them i beg your pardon but won't you wait one minute she asked the girls stopped with wondering faces it's your clothes explained mrs sinton you look just beautiful to me you look exactly as i should have wanted to see my girls they both died of diphtheria when they were little but they had yellow hair dark eyes and pink cheeks and everybody thought they were lovely if they had lived they'd been near your age now and i'd want them to look like you there was sympathy on every girl face why thank you said one of them we are very sorry for you of course you are said margaret everybody always has been and because i can't ever have the joy of a mother in thinking for my girls and buying pretty things for them there is nothing left for me but to do what i can for some one who has no mother to care for her i know a girl who would be just as pretty as any of you if she had the clothes but her mother does not think about her so i mother her some myself she must be a lucky girl said another oh she loves me said margaret and i love her i want her to look just like you do please tell me about your clothes are these the dresses and hats you wear to school what kind of goods are they and where do you buy them the girls began to laugh and cluster around margaret wesley strode down the store with his head high through pride in her but his heart was sore over the memory of two little faces under brushwood sod he inquired his way to the shoe department why every one of us have on gingham or linen dresses they said and they are our school clothes for a few moments there was a babel of laughing voices explaining to the delighted margaret that school dresses should be bright and pretty but simple and plain and until cold weather they should wash i'll tell you said ellen brownlee my father owns this store i know all the clerks i'll take you to miss hartley you tell her just how much you want to spend and what you want to buy and she will know how to get the most for your money i've heard papa say she was the best clerk in the store for people who didn't know precisely what they wanted that's the very thing agreed margaret but before you go tell me about your hair elnora's hair is bright and wavy but yours is silky as hackled flax how do you do it elnora asked four girls in concert yes elnora is the name of the girl i want these things for did she come to the high school to day questioned one of them was she in your classes demanded margaret without reply four girls stood silent and thought fast had there been a strange girl among them and had she been overlooked and passed by with indifference because she was so very shabby if she had appeared as much better than they as she had looked worse would her reception have been the same there was a strange girl from the country in the freshman class to day said ellen brownlee and her name was elnora that was the girl said margaret are her people so very poor questioned ellen no not poor at all come to think of it answered margaret it's a peculiar case mrs comstock had a great trouble and she let it change her whole life and make a different woman of her she used to be lovely now she is forever saving and scared to death for fear they will go to the poorhouse but there is a big farm covered with lots of good timber the taxes are high for women who can't manage to clear and work the land there ought to be enough to keep two of them in good shape all their lives if they only knew how to do it but no one ever told kate comstock anything and never will for she won't listen all she does is droop all day and walk the edge of the swamp half the night and neglect elnora if you girls would make life just a little easier for her it would be the finest thing you ever did all of them promised they would now tell me about your hair persisted margaret sinton so they took her to a toilet counter and she bought the proper hair soap also a nail file and cold cream for use after windy days then they left her with the experienced clerk and when at last wesley found her she was loaded with bundles and the light of other days was in her beautiful eyes wesley also carried some packages did you get any stockings he whispered no i didn't she said i was so interested in dresses and hair ribbons and a a hat she hesitated and glanced at wesley of course a hat prompted wesley that i forgot all about those horrible shoes she's got to have decent shoes wesley sure said wesley she's got decent shoes but the man said some brown stockings ought to go with them take a peep will you wesley opened a box and displayed a pair of thick soled beautifully shaped brown walking shoes of low cut margaret cried out with pleasure but do you suppose they are the right size wesley what did you get i just said for a girl of sixteen with a slender foot well that's about as near as i could come if they don't fit when she tries them we will drive straight in and change them come on now let's get home all the way they discussed how they should give elnora their purchases and what mrs comstock would say i am afraid she will be awful mad said margaret she'll just rip replied wesley graphically but if she wants to leave the raising of her girl to the neighbours she needn't get fractious if they take some pride in doing a good job from now on i calculate elnora shall go to school and she shall have all the clothes and books she needs if i go around on the back of kate comstock's land and cut a tree or drive off a calf to pay for them why i know one tree she owns that would put elnora in heaven for a year just think of it margaret it's not fair one third of what is there belongs to elnora by law and if kate comstock raises a row i'll tell her so and see that the girl gets it you go to see kate in the morning and i'll go with you tell her you want elnora's pattern that you are going to make her a dress for helping us and sort of hint at a few more things if kate balks i'll take a hand and settle her i'll go to law for elnora's share of that land and sell enough to educate her why wesley sinton you're perfectly wild i'm not did you ever stop to think that such cases are so frequent there have been laws made to provide for them i can bring it up in court and force kate to educate elnora and board and clothe her till she's of age and then she can take her share wesley kate would go crazy she's crazy now the idea of any mother living with as sweet a girl as elnora and letting her suffer till i find her crying like a funeral it makes me fighting mad all uncalled for not a grain of sense in it i've offered and offered to oversee clearing her land and working her fields let her sell a good tree or a few acres something is going to be done right now elnora's been fairly happy up to this but to spoil the school life she's planned is to ruin all her life i won't have it if elnora won't take these things so help me i'll tell her what she is worth and loan her the money and she can pay me back when she comes of age i am going to have it out with kate comstock in the morning here we are you open up what you got while i put away the horses and then i'll show you when wesley came from the barn margaret had four pieces of crisp gingham a pale blue a pink a gray with green stripes and a rich brown and blue plaid on each of them lay a yard and a half of wide ribbon to match there were handkerchiefs and a brown leather belt in her hands she held a wide brimmed tan straw hat having a high crown banded with velvet strips each of which fastened with a tiny gold buckle it looks kind of bare now she explained it had three quills on it here did you have them taken off asked wesley yes i did the price was two and a half for the hat and those things were a dollar and a half apiece i couldn't pay that it does seem considerable admitted wesley but will it look right without them no it won't said margaret it's going to have quills on it do you remember those beautiful peacock wing feathers that phoebe simms gave me three of them go on just where those came off and nobody will ever know the difference they match the hat to a moral and they are just a little longer and richer than the ones that i had taken off i was wondering whether i better sew them on to night while i remember how they set or wait till morning don't risk it exclaimed wesley anxiously don't you risk it sew them on right now open your bundles while i get the thread said margaret wesley unwrapped the shoes margaret took them up and pinched the leather and stroked them my but they are fine she cried wesley picked up one and slowly turned it in his big hands he glanced at his foot and back to the shoe it's a little bit of a thing margaret he said softly like as not i'll have to take it back it seems as if it couldn't fit it seems as if it didn't dare do anything else said margaret that's a happy little shoe to get the chance to carry as fine a girl as elnora to high school now what's in the other box wesley looked at margaret doubtfully why he said you know there's going to be rainy days and those things she has now ain't fit for anything but to drive up the cows wesley did you get high shoes too well she ought to have them the man said he would make them cheaper if i took both pairs at once margaret laughed aloud those will do her past christmas she exulted what else did you buy well sir said wesley i saw something to day you told me about kate getting that tin pail for elnora to carry to high school and you said you told her it was a shame i guess elnora was ashamed all right for to night she stopped at the old case duncan gave her and took out that pail where it had been all day and put a napkin inside it coming home she confessed she was half starved because she hid her dinner under a culvert and a tramp took it she hadn't had a bite to eat the whole day but she never complained at all she was pleased that she hadn't lost the napkin so i just inquired around till i found this and i think it's about the ticket wesley opened the package and laid a brown leather lunch box on the table might be a couple of books or drawing tools or most anything that's neat and genteel you see it opens this way it did open and inside was a space for sandwiches a little porcelain box for cold meat or fried chicken another for salad a glass with a lid which screwed on held by a ring in a corner for custard or jelly a flask for tea or milk a beautiful little knife fork and spoon fastened in holders and a place for a napkin margaret was almost crying over it how i'd love to fill it she exclaimed do it the first time just to show kate comstock what love is said wesley get up early in the morning and make one of those dresses to morrow can't you make a plain gingham dress in a day i'll pick a chicken and you fry it and fix a little custard for the cup and do it up brown go on maggie you do it i never can said margaret i am slow as the itch about sewing and these are not going to be plain dresses when it comes to making them there are going to be edgings of plain green pink and brown to the bias strips and tucks and pleats around the hips fancy belts and collars and all of it takes time then kate comstock's got to help said wesley can the two of you make one and get that lunch to morrow easy but she'll never do it you see if she doesn't said wesley you get up and cut it out and soon as elnora is gone i'll go after kate myself she'll take what i'll say better alone but she'll come and she'll help make the dress these other things are our christmas gifts to elnora she'll no doubt need them more now than she will then and we can give them just as well that's yours and this is mine or whichever way you choose wesley untied a good brown umbrella and shook out the folds of a long brown raincoat margaret dropped the hat arose and took the coat she tried it on felt it cooed over it and matched it with the umbrella did it look anything like rain to night she inquired so anxiously that wesley laughed and this last bundle she said dropping back in her chair the coat still over her shoulders i couldn't buy this much stuff for any other woman and nothing for my own said wesley it's christmas for you too margaret he shook out fold after fold of soft gray satiny goods that would look lovely against margaret's pink cheeks and whitening hair oh you old darling she exclaimed and fled sobbing into his arms but she soon dried her eyes raked together the coals in the cooking stove and boiled one of the dress patterns in salt water for half an hour wesley held the lamp while she hung the goods on the line to dry then she set the irons on the stove so they would be hot the first thing in the morning chapter iii wherein elnora visits the bird woman and opens a bank account four o'clock the following morning elnora was shelling beans at six she fed the chickens and pigs swept two of the rooms of the cabin built a fire and put on the kettle for breakfast then she climbed the narrow stairs to the attic she had occupied since a very small child and dressed in the hated shoes and brown calico plastered down her crisp curls ate what breakfast she could and pinning on her hat started for town there is no sense in your going for an hour yet said her mother i must try to discover some way to earn those books replied elnora i am perfectly positive i shall not find them lying beside the road wrapped in tissue paper and tagged with my name she went toward the city as on yesterday her perplexity as to where tuition and books were to come from was worse but she did not feel quite so badly she never again would have to face all of it for the first time there had been times yesterday when she had prayed to be hidden or to drop dead and neither had happened i believe the best way to get an answer to prayer is to work for it muttered elnora grimly again she followed the trail to the swamp rearranged her hair and left the tin pail this time she folded a couple of sandwiches in the napkin and tied them in a neat light paper parcel which she carried in her hand then she hurried along the road to onabasha and found a book store there she asked the prices of the list of books that she needed and learned that six dollars would not quite supply them she anxiously inquired for second hand books but was told that the only way to secure them was from the last year's freshmen just then elnora felt that she positively could not approach any of those she supposed to be sophomores and ask to buy their old books the only balm the girl could see for the humiliation of yesterday was to appear that day with a set of new books do you wish these asked the clerk hurriedly for the store was rapidly filling with school children wanting anything from a dictionary to a pen yes gasped elnora oh yes but i cannot pay for them just now please let me take them and i will pay for them on friday or return"
