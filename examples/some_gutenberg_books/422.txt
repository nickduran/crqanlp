"1" "name that krishna and the fury and love of persecution which it inspired said the man in black a hot blast came from the east sounding krishna it absolutely maddened people's minds and the people would call themselves his children we will not belong to jupiter any longer we will belong to krishna and they did belong to krishna that is in name but in nothing else for who ever cared for krishna in the christian world or who ever regarded the words attributed to him or put them in practice why we protestants regard his words and endeavour to practise what they enjoin as much as possible but you reject his image said the man in black better reject his words than his image no religion can exist long which rejects a good bodily image why the very negro barbarians of high barbary could give you a lesson on that point they have their fetish images to which they look for help in their afflictions they have likewise a high priest whom they call mumbo jumbo said i i know all about him already how came you to know anything about him said the man in black with a look of some surprise some of us poor protestants tinkers said i though we live in dingles are also acquainted with a thing or two i really believe you are said the man in black staring at me but in connection with this mumbo jumbo i could relate to you a comical story about a fellow an english servant i once met at rome it would be quite unnecessary said i i would much sooner hear you talk about krishna his words and image spoken like a true heretic said the man in black one of the faithful would have placed his image before his words for what are all the words in the world compared with a good bodily image i believe you occasionally quote his words said i he he said the man in black occasionally for example said i upon this rock i will found my church he he said the man in black you must really become one of us yet you must have had some difficulty in getting the rock to rome none whatever said the man in black faith can remove mountains to say nothing of rocks ho ho but i cannot imagine said i what advantage you could derive from perverting those words of scripture in which the saviour talks about eating his body i do not know indeed why we troubled our heads about the matter at all said the man in black but when you talk about perverting the meaning of the text you speak ignorantly mr tinker when he whom you call the saviour gave his followers the sop and bade them eat it telling them it was his body he delicately alluded to what it was incumbent upon them to do after his death namely to eat his body you do not mean to say that he intended they should actually eat his body then you suppose ignorantly said the man in black eating the bodies of the dead was a heathenish custom practised by the heirs and legatees of people who left property and this custom is alluded to in the text but what has the new testament to do with heathen customs said i except to destroy them more than you suppose said the man in black we priests of rome who have long lived at rome know much better what the new testament is made of than the heretics and their theologians not forgetting their tinkers though i confess some of the latter have occasionally surprised us for example bunyan the new testament is crowded with allusions to heathen customs and with words connected with pagan sorcery now with respect to words i would fain have you who pretend to be a philologist tell me the meaning of amen i made no answer we of rome said the man in black know two or three things of which the heretics are quite ignorant for example there are those amongst us those too who do not pretend to be philologists who know what amen is and moreover how we got it we got it from our ancestors the priests of ancient rome and they got the word from their ancestors of the east the priests of buddh and brahma and what is the meaning of the word i demanded amen said the man in black is a modification of the old hindoo formula omani batsikhom by the almost ceaseless repetition of which the indians hope to be received finally to the rest or state of forgetfulness of buddh or brahma a foolish practice you will say but are you heretics much wiser who are continually sticking amen to the end of your prayers little knowing when you do so that you are consigning yourselves to the repose of buddh oh what hearty laughs our missionaries have had when comparing the eternally sounding eastern gibberish of omani batsikhom omani batsikhom and the ave maria and amen jesus of our own idiotical devotees i have nothing to say about the ave marias and amens of your superstitious devotees said i i dare say that they use them nonsensically enough but in putting amen to the end of a prayer we merely intend to express so let it be it means nothing of the kind said the man in black and the hindoos might just as well put your national oath at the end of their prayers as perhaps they will after a great many thousand years when english is forgotten and only a few words of it remembered by dim tradition without being understood how strange if after the lapse of four thousand years the hindoos should damn themselves to the blindness so dear to their present masters even as their masters at present consign themselves to the forgetfulness so dear to the hindoos but my glass has been empty for a considerable time perhaps bellissima biondina said he addressing belle you will deign to replenish it i shall do no such thing said belle you have drunk quite enough and talked more than enough and to tell you the truth i wish you would leave us alone shame on you belle said i consider the obligations of hospitality i am sick of that word said belle you are so frequently misusing it were this place not mumpers dingle and consequently as free to the fellow as ourselves i would lead him out of it pray be quiet belle said i you had better help yourself said i addressing myself to the man in black the lady is angry with you i am sorry for it said the man in black if she is angry with me i am not so with her and shall be always proud to wait upon her in the meantime i will wait upon myself chapter iv the proposal the scotch novel latitude miracles pestilent heretics old fraser wonderful texts no armenian the man in black having helped himself to some more of his favourite beverage and tasted it i thus addressed him the evening is getting rather advanced and i can see that this lady pointing to belle is anxious for her tea which she prefers to take cosily and comfortably with me in the dingle the place it is true is as free to you as to ourselves nevertheless as we are located here by necessity whilst you merely come as a visitor i must take the liberty of telling you that we shall be glad to be alone as soon as you have said what you have to say and have finished the glass of refreshment at present in your hand i think you said some time ago that one of your motives for coming hither was to induce me to enlist under the banner of rome i wish to know whether that was really the case decidedly so said the man in black i come here principally in the hope of enlisting you in our regiment in which i have no doubt you could do us excellent service would you enlist my companion as well i demanded we should be only too proud to have her among us whether she comes with you or alone said the man in black with a polite bow to belle before we give you an answer i replied i would fain know more about you perhaps you will declare your name that i will never do said the man in black no one in england knows it but myself and i will not declare it even in a dingle as for the rest _sono un prete cattolico appostolico_ that is all that many a one of us can say for himself and it assuredly means a great deal we will now proceed to business said i you must be aware that we english are generally considered a self interested people and with considerable justice said the man in black drinking well you are a person of acute perception and i will presently make it evident to you that it would be to your interest to join with us you are at present evidently in very needy circumstances and are lost not only to yourself but to the world but should you enlist with us i could find you an occupation not only agreeable but one in which your talents would have free scope i would introduce you in the various grand houses here in england to which i have myself admission as a surprising young gentleman of infinite learning who by dint of study has discovered that the roman is the only true faith i tell you confidently that our popish females would make a saint nay a god of you they are fools enough for anything there is one person in particular with whom i would wish to make you acquainted in the hope that you would be able to help me to perform good service to the holy see he is a gouty old fellow of some learning residing in an old hall near the great western seaport and is one of the very few amongst the english catholics possessing a grain of sense i think you could help us to govern him for he is not unfrequently disposed to be restive asks us strange questions occasionally threatens us with his crutch and behaves so that we are often afraid that we shall lose him or rather his property which he has bequeathed to us and which is enormous i am sure that you could help us to deal with him sometimes with your humour sometimes with your learning and perhaps occasionally with your fists and in what manner would you provide for my companion said i we would place her at once said the man in black in the house of two highly respectable catholic ladies in this neighbourhood where she would be treated with every care and consideration till her conversion should be accomplished in a regular manner we would then remove her to a female monastic establishment where after undergoing a year's probation during which time she would be instructed in every elegant accomplishment she should take the veil her advancement would speedily follow for with such a face and figure she would make a capital lady abbess especially in italy to which country she would probably be sent ladies of her hair and complexion to say nothing of her height being a curiosity in the south with a little care and management she could soon obtain a vast reputation for sanctity and who knows but after her death she might become a glorified saint he he sister maria theresa for that is the name i propose you should bear holy mother maria theresa glorified and celestial saint i have the honour of drinking to your health and the man in black drank well belle said i what have you to say to the gentleman's proposal that if he goes on in this way i will break his glass against his mouth you have heard the lady's answer said i i have said the man in black and shall not press the matter i can't help however repeating that she would make a capital lady abbess she would keep the nuns in order i warrant her no easy matter break the glass against my mouth he he how she would send the holy utensils flying at the nuns heads occasionally and just the person to wring the nose of satan should he venture to appear one night in her cell in the shape of a handsome black man no offence madam no offence pray retain your seat said he observing that belle had started up i mean no offence well if you will not consent to be an abbess perhaps you will consent to follow this young zingaro and to co operate with him and us i am a priest madam and can join you both in an instant _connubio stabili_ as i suppose the knot has not been tied already hold your mumping gibberish said belle and leave the dingle this moment for though tis free to every one you have no right to insult me in it pray be pacified said i to belle getting up and placing myself between her and the man in black he will presently leave take my word for it there sit down again said i as i led her to her seat then resuming my own i said to the man in black i advise you to leave the dingle as soon as possible i should wish to have your answer to my proposal first said he well then here you shall have it i will not entertain your proposal i detest your schemes they are both wicked and foolish wicked said the man in black have they not he he the furtherance of religion in view a religion said i in which you yourself do not believe and which you contemn whether i believe in it or not said the man in black it is adapted for the generality of the human race so i will forward it and advise you to do the same it was nearly extirpated in these regions but it is springing up again owing to circumstances radicalism is a good friend to us all the liberals laud up our system out of hatred to the established church though our system is ten times less liberal than the church of england some of them have really come over to us i myself confess a baronet who presided over the first radical meeting ever held in england he was an atheist when he came over to us in the hope of mortifying his own church but he is now ho ho a real catholic devotee quite afraid of my threats i make him frequently scourge himself before me well radicalism does us good service especially amongst the lower classes for radicalism chiefly flourishes amongst them for though a baronet or two may be found amongst the radicals and perhaps as many lords fellows who have been discarded by their own order for clownishness or something they have done it incontestably flourishes best among the lower orders then the love of what is foreign is a great friend to us this love is chiefly confined to the middle and upper classes some admire the french and imitate them others must needs be spaniards dress themselves up in a zamarra stick a cigar in their mouth and say carajo others would pass for germans he he the idea of any one wishing to pass for a german but what has done us more service than anything else in these regions i mean amidst the middle classes has been the novel the scotch novel the good folks since they have read the novels have become jacobites and because all the jacobs were papists the good folks must become papists also or at least papistically inclined the very scotch presbyterians since they have read the novels are become all but papists i speak advisedly having lately been amongst them there's a trumpery bit of a half papist sect called the scotch episcopalian church which lay dormant and nearly forgotten for upwards of a hundred years which has of late got wonderfully into fashion in scotland because forsooth some of the long haired gentry of the novels were said to belong to it such as montrose and dundee and to this the presbyterians are going over in throngs traducing and vilifying their own forefathers or denying them altogether and calling themselves descendants of ho ho ho scottish cavaliers i have heard them myself repeating snatches of jacobite ditties about bonnie dundee and come fill up my cup and fill up my can and saddle my horse and call up my man there's stuff for you not that i object to the first part of the ditty it is natural enough that a scotchman should cry come fill up my cup more especially if he's drinking at another person's expense all scotchmen being fond of liquor at free cost but saddle his horse for what purpose i would ask where is the use of saddling a horse unless you can ride him and where was there ever a scotchman who could ride of course you have not a drop of scotch blood in your veins said i otherwise you would never have uttered that last sentence don't be too sure of that said the man in black you know little of popery if you imagine that it cannot extinguish love of country even in a scotchman a thorough going papist and who more thorough going than myself cares nothing for his country and why should he he belongs to a system and not to a country one thing said i connected with you i cannot understand you call yourself a thorough going papist yet are continually saying the most pungent things against popery and turning to unbounded ridicule those who show any inclination to embrace it rome is a very sensible old body said the man in black and little cares what her children say provided they do her bidding she knows several things and amongst others that no servants work so hard and faithfully as those who curse their masters at every stroke they do she was not fool enough to be angry with the miquelets of alba who renounced her and called her puta all the time they were cutting the throats of the netherlanders now if she allowed her faithful soldiers the latitude of renouncing her and calling her puta in the market place think not she is so unreasonable as to object to her faithful priests occasionally calling her puta in the dingle but said i suppose some one were to tell the world some of the disorderly things which her priests say in the dingle he would have the fate of cassandra said the man in black no one would believe him yes the priests would but they would make no sign of belief they believe in the alcoran des cordeliers that is those who have read it but they make no sign a pretty system said i which extinguishes love of country and of everything noble and brings the minds of its ministers to a parity with those of devils who delight in nothing but mischief the system said the man in black is a grand one with unbounded vitality compare it with your protestantism and you will see the difference popery is ever at work whilst protestantism is supine a pretty church indeed the protestant why it can't even work a miracle can your church work miracles i demanded that was the very question said the man in black which the ancient british clergy asked of austin monk after they had been fools enough to acknowledge their own inability we don't pretend to work miracles do you oh dear me yes said austin we find no difficulty in the matter we can raise the dead we can make the blind see and to convince you i will give sight to the blind here is this blind saxon whom you cannot cure but on whose eyes i will manifest my power in order to show the difference between the true and the false church and forthwith with the assistance of a handkerchief and a little hot water he opened the eyes of the barbarian so we manage matters a pretty church that old british church which could not work miracles quite as helpless as the modern one the fools was birdlime so scarce a thing amongst them and were the properties of warm water so unknown to them that they could not close a pair of eyes and open them it's a pity said i that the british clergy at that interview with austin did not bring forward a blind welshman and ask the monk to operate upon him clearly said the man in black that's what they ought to have done but they were fools without a single resource here he took a sip at his glass but they did not believe in the miracle said i and what did their not believing avail them said the man in black austin remained master of the field and they went away holding their heads down and muttering to themselves what a fine subject for a painting would be austin's opening the eyes of the saxon barbarian and the discomfiture of the british clergy i wonder it has not been painted he he i suppose your church still performs miracles occasionally said i it does said the man in black the rev has lately been performing miracles in ireland destroying devils that had got possession of people he has been eminently successful in two instances he not only destroyed the devils but the lives of the people possessed he he oh there is so much energy in our system we are always at work whilst protestantism is supine you must not imagine said i that all protestants are supine some of them appear to be filled with unbounded zeal they deal it is true not in lying miracles but they propagate god's word i remember only a few months ago having occasion for a bible going to an establishment the object of which was to send bibles all over the world the supporters of that establishment could have no self interested views for i was supplied by them with a noble sized bible at a price so small as to preclude the idea that it could bring any profit to the vendors the countenance of the man in black slightly fell i know the people to whom you allude said he indeed unknown to them i have frequently been to see them and observed their ways i tell you frankly that there is not a set of people in this kingdom who have caused our church so much trouble and uneasiness i should rather say that they alone cause us any for as for the rest what with their drowsiness their plethora their folly and their vanity they are doing us anything but mischief these fellows are a pestilent set of heretics whom we would gladly see burnt they are with the most untiring perseverance and in spite of divers minatory declarations of the holy father scattering their books abroad through all europe and have caused many people in catholic countries to think that hitherto their priesthood have endeavoured as much as possible to keep them blinded there is one fellow amongst them for whom we entertain a particular aversion a big burly parson with the face of a lion the voice of a buffalo and a fist like a sledge hammer the last time i was there i observed that his eye was upon me and i did not like the glance he gave me at all i observed him clench his fist and i took my departure as fast as i conveniently could whether he suspected who i was i know not but i did not like his look at all and do not intend to go again well then said i you confess that you have redoubtable enemies to your plans in these regions and that even amongst the ecclesiastics there are some widely different from those of the plethoric and platitude schools it is but too true said the man in black and if the rest of your church were like them we should quickly bid adieu to all hope of converting these regions but we are thankful to be able to say that such folks are not numerous there are moreover causes at work quite sufficient to undermine even their zeal their sons return at the vacations from oxford and cambridge puppies full of the nonsense which they have imbibed from platitude professors and this nonsense they retail at home where it fails not to make some impression whilst the daughters scream i beg their pardons warble about scotland's montrose and bonny dundee and all the jacobs so we have no doubt that their papas zeal about the propagation of such a vulgar book as the bible will in a very little time be terribly diminished old rome will win so you had better join her and the man in black drained the last drop in his glass never said i will i become the slave of rome she will allow you latitude said the man in black do but serve her and she will allow you to call her puta at a decent time and place her popes occasionally call her puta a pope has been known to start from his bed at midnight and rush out into the corridor and call out puta three times in a voice which pierced the vatican that pope was alexander the sixth i dare say said i the greatest monster that ever existed though the worthiest head which the pope system ever had so his conscience was not always still i thought it had been seared with a brand of iron i did not allude to him but to a much more modern pope said the man in black it is true he brought the word which is spanish from spain his native country to rome he was very fond of calling the church by that name and other popes have taken it up she will allow you to call her by it if you belong to her i shall call her so said i without belonging to her or asking her permission she will allow you to treat her as such if you belong to her said the man in black there is a chapel in rome where there is a wondrously fair statue the son of a cardinal i mean his nephew once well she did not cut off his head but slightly boxed his cheek and bade him go i have read all about that in keysler's travels said i do you tell her that i would not touch her with a pair of tongs unless to seize her nose she is fond of lucre said the man in black but does not grudge a faithful priest a little private perquisite and he took out a very handsome gold repeater are you not afraid said i to flash that watch before the eyes of a poor tinker in a dingle not before the eyes of one like you said the man in black it is getting late said i i care not for perquisites so you will not join us said the man in black you have had my answer said i if i belong to rome said the man in black why should not you i may be a poor tinker said i but i may never have undergone what you have you remember perhaps the fable of the fox who had lost his tail the man in black winced but almost immediately recovering himself he said well we can do without you we are sure of winning it is not the part of wise people said i to make sure of the battle before it is fought there's the landlord of the public house who made sure that his cocks would win yet the cocks lost the main and the landlord is little better than a bankrupt people very different from the landlord said the man in black both in intellect and station think we shall surely win there are clever machinators among us who have no doubt of our success well said i i will set the landlord aside and will adduce one who was in every point a very different person from the landlord both in understanding and station he was very fond of laying schemes and indeed many of them turned out successful his last and darling one however miscarried notwithstanding that by his calculations he had persuaded himself that there was no possibility of its failing the person that i allude to was old fraser who said the man in black giving a start and letting his glass fall old fraser of lovat said i the prince of all conspirators and machinators he made sure of placing the pretender on the throne of these realms i can bring into the field so many men said he my son in law cluny so many and likewise my cousin and my good friend then speaking of those on whom the government reckoned for support he would say so and so are lukewarm this person is ruled by his wife who is with us the clergy are anything but hostile"
