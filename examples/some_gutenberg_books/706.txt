"1" "close against it and was hiding the light with his body when a short and sudden crash made my heart stand still next moment i saw the door wide open and raffles standing within and beckoning me with a jimmy door number one he whispered deuce knows how many more there'll be but i know of two at least we won't have to make much noise over them either down here there's less risk we were now at the bottom of the exact fellow to the narrow stone stair which we had just descended the yard or well being the one part common to both the private and the business premises but this flight led to no open passage instead a singularly solid mahogany door confronted us at the top i thought so muttered raffles handing me the lantern and pocketing a bunch of skeleton keys after tampering for a few minutes with the lock it'll be an hour's work to get through that can't you pick it no i know these locks it's no use trying we must cut it out and it'll take us an hour it took us forty seven minutes by my watch or rather it took raffles and never in my life have i seen anything more deliberately done my part was simply to stand by with the dark lantern in one hand and a small bottle of rock oil in the other raffles had produced a pretty embroidered case intended obviously for his razors but filled instead with the tools of his secret trade including the rock oil from this case he selected a bit capable of drilling a hole an inch in diameter and fitted it to a small but very strong steel brace then he took off his covert coat and his blazer spread them neatly on the top step knelt on them turned up his shirt cuffs and went to work with brace and bit near the key hole but first he oiled the bit to minimize the noise and this he did invariably before beginning a fresh hole and often in the middle of one it took thirty two separate borings to cut around that lock i noticed that through the first circular orifice raffles thrust a forefinger then as the circle became an ever lengthening oval he got his hand through up to the thumb and i heard him swear softly to himself i was afraid so what is it an iron gate on the other side how on earth are we to get through that i asked in dismay pick the lock but there may be two in that case they'll be top and bottom and we shall have two fresh holes to make as the door opens inwards it won't open two inches as it is i confess i did not feel sanguine about the lock picking seeing that one lock had baffled us already and my disappointment and impatience must have been a revelation to me had i stopped to think the truth is that i was entering into our nefarious undertaking with an involuntary zeal of which i was myself quite unconscious at the time the romance and the peril of the whole proceeding held me spellbound and entranced my moral sense and my sense of fear were stricken by a common paralysis and there i stood shining my light and holding my phial with a keener interest than i had ever brought to any honest avocation and there knelt a j raffles with his black hair tumbled and the same watchful quiet determined half smile with which i have seen him send down over after over in a county match at last the chain of holes was complete the lock wrenched out bodily and a splendid bare arm plunged up to the shoulder through the aperture and through the bars of the iron gate beyond now whispered raffles if there's only one lock it'll be in the middle joy here it is only let me pick it and we're through at last he withdrew his arm a skeleton key was selected from the bunch and then back went his arm to the shoulder it was a breathless moment i heard the heart throbbing in my body the very watch ticking in my pocket and ever and anon the tinkle tinkle of the skeleton key then at last there came a single unmistakable click in another minute the mahogany door and the iron gate yawned behind us and raffles was sitting on an office table wiping his face with the lantern throwing a steady beam by his side we were now in a bare and roomy lobby behind the shop but separated therefrom by an iron curtain the very sight of which filled me with despair raffles however did not appear in the least depressed but hung up his coat and hat on some pegs in the lobby before examining this curtain with his lantern that's nothing said he after a minute's inspection we'll be through that in no time but there's a door on the other side which may give us trouble another door i groaned and how do you mean to tackle this thing prise it up with the jointed jimmy the weak point of these iron curtains is the leverage you can get from below but it makes a noise and this is where you're coming in bunny this is where i couldn't do without you i must have you overhead to knock through when the street's clear i'll come with you and show a light well you may imagine how little i liked the prospect of this lonely vigil and yet there was something very stimulating in the vital responsibility which it involved hitherto i had been a mere spectator now i was to take part in the game and the fresh excitement made me more than ever insensible to those considerations of conscience and of safety which were already as dead nerves in my breast so i took my post without a murmur in the front room above the shop the fixtures had been left for the refusal of the incoming tenant and fortunately for us they included venetian blinds which were already down it was the simplest matter in the world to stand peeping through the laths into the street to beat twice with my foot when anybody was approaching and once when all was clear again the noises that even i could hear below with the exception of one metallic crash at the beginning were indeed incredibly slight but they ceased altogether at each double rap from my toe and a policeman passed quite half a dozen times beneath my eyes and the man whom i took to be the jeweller's watchman oftener still during the better part of an hour that i spent at the window once indeed my heart was in my mouth but only once it was when the watchman stopped and peered through the peep hole into the lighted shop i waited for his whistle i waited for the gallows or the gaol but my signals had been studiously obeyed and the man passed on in undisturbed serenity in the end i had a signal in my turn and retraced my steps with lighted matches down the broad stairs down the narrow ones across the area and up into the lobby where raffles awaited me with an outstretched hand well done my boy said he you're the same good man in a pinch and you shall have your reward i've got a thousand pounds worth if i've got a penn'oth it's all in my pockets and here's something else i found in this locker very decent port and some cigars meant for poor dear danby's business friends take a pull and you shall light up presently i've found a lavatory too and we must have a wash and brush up before we go for i'm as black as your boot the iron curtain was down but he insisted on raising it until i could peep through the glass door on the other side and see his handiwork in the shop beyond here two electric lights were left burning all night long and in their cold white rays i could at first see nothing amiss i looked along an orderly lane an empty glass counter on my left glass cupboards of untouched silver on my right and facing me the filmy black eye of the peep hole that shone like a stage moon on the street the counter had not been emptied by raffles its contents were in the chubb's safe which he had given up at a glance nor had he looked at the silver except to choose a cigarette case for me he had confined himself entirely to the shop window this was in three compartments each secured for the night by removable panels with separate locks raffles had removed them a few hours before their time and the electric light shone on a corrugated shutter bare as the ribs of an empty carcase every article of value was gone from the one place which was invisible from the little window in the door elsewhere all was as it had been left overnight and but for a train of mangled doors behind the iron curtain a bottle of wine and a cigar box with which liberties had been taken a rather black towel in the lavatory a burnt match here and there and our finger marks on the dusty banisters not a trace of our visit did we leave had it in my head for long said raffles as we strolled through the streets towards dawn for all the world as though we were returning from a dance no bunny i never thought of it till i saw that upper part empty about a month ago and bought a few things in the shop to get the lie of the land that reminds me that i never paid for them but by jove i will to morrow and if that isn't poetic justice what is one visit showed me the possibilities of the place but a second convinced me of its impossibilities without a pal so i had practically given up the idea when you came along on the very night and in the very plight for it but here we are at the albany and i hope there's some fire left for i don't know how you feel bunny but for my part i'm as cold as keats's owl he could think of keats on his way from a felony he could hanker for his fireside like another floodgates were loosed within me and the plain english of our adventure rushed over me as cold as ice raffles was a burglar i had helped him to commit one burglary therefore i was a burglar too yet i could stand and warm myself by his fire and watch him empty his pockets as though we had done nothing wonderful or wicked my blood froze my heart sickened my brain whirled how i had liked this villain how i had admired him now my liking and admiration must turn to loathing and disgust i waited for the change i longed to feel it in my heart but i longed and i waited in vain i saw that he was emptying his pockets the table sparkled with their hoard rings by the dozen diamonds by the score bracelets pendants aigrettes necklaces pearls rubies amethysts sapphires and diamonds always diamonds in everything flashing bayonets of light dazzling me blinding me making me disbelieve because i could no longer forget last of all came no gem indeed but my own revolver from an inner pocket and that struck a chord i suppose i said something my hand flew out i can see raffles now as he looked at me once more with a high arch over each clear eye i can see him pick out the cartridges with his quiet cynical smile before he would give me my pistol back again you mayn't believe it bunny said he but i never carried a loaded one before on the whole i think it gives one confidence yet it would be very awkward if anything went wrong one might use it and that's not the game at all though i have often thought that the murderer who has just done the trick must have great sensations before things get too hot for him don't look so distressed my dear chap i've never had those sensations and i don't suppose i ever shall but this much you have done before said i hoarsely before my dear bunny you offend me did it look like a first attempt of course i have done it before often well no not often enough to destroy the charm at all events never as a matter of fact unless i'm cursedly hard up did you hear about the thimbleby diamonds well that was the last time and a poor lot of paste they were then there was the little business of the dormer house boat at henley last year that was mine also such as it was i've never brought off a really big coup yet when i do i shall chuck it up yes i remembered both cases very well to think that he was their author it was incredible outrageous inconceivable then my eyes would fall upon the table twinkling and glittering in a hundred places and incredulity was at an end how came you to begin i asked as curiosity overcame mere wonder and a fascination for his career gradually wove itself into my fascination for the man ah that's a long story said raffles it was in the colonies when i was out there playing cricket it's too long a story to tell you now but i was in much the same fix that you were in to night and it was my only way out i never meant it for anything more but i'd tasted blood and it was all over with me why should i work when i could steal why settle down to some humdrum uncongenial billet when excitement romance danger and a decent living were all going begging together of course it's very wrong but we can't all be moralists and the distribution of wealth is very wrong to begin with besides you're not at it all the time i'm sick of quoting gilbert's lines to myself but they're profoundly true i only wonder if you'll like the life as much as i do like it i cried out not i it's no life for me once is enough you wouldn't give me a hand another time don't ask me raffles don't ask me for god's sake yet you said you would do anything for me you asked me to name my crime but i knew at the time you didn't mean it you didn't go back on me to night and that ought to satisfy me goodness knows i suppose i'm ungrateful and unreasonable and all that i ought to let it end at this but you're the very man for me bunny the very man just think how we got through to night not a scratch not a hitch there's nothing very terrible in it you see there never would be while we worked together he was standing in front of me with a hand on either shoulder he was smiling as he knew so well how to smile i turned on my heel planted my elbows on the chimney piece and my burning head between my hands next instant a still heartier hand had fallen on my back all right my boy you are quite right and i'm worse than wrong i'll never ask it again go if you want to and come again about mid day for the cash there was no bargain but of course i'll get you out of your scrape especially after the way you've stood by me to night i was round again with my blood on fire i'll do it again i said through my teeth he shook his head not you he said smiling quite good humoredly on my insane enthusiasm i will i cried with an oath i'll lend you a hand as often as you like what does it matter now i've been in it once i'll be in it again i've gone to the devil anyhow i can't go back and wouldn't if i could nothing matters another rap when you want me i'm your man and that is how raffles and i joined felonious forces on the ides of march a costume piece london was just then talking of one whose name is already a name and nothing more reuben rosenthall had made his millions on the diamond fields of south africa and had come home to enjoy them according to his lights how he went to work will scarcely be forgotten by any reader of the halfpenny evening papers which revelled in endless anecdotes of his original indigence and present prodigality varied with interesting particulars of the extraordinary establishment which the millionaire set up in st john's wood here he kept a retinue of kaffirs who were literally his slaves and hence he would sally with enormous diamonds in his shirt and on his finger in the convoy of a prize fighter of heinous repute who was not however by any means the worst element in the rosenthall melange so said common gossip but the fact was sufficiently established by the interference of the police on at least one occasion followed by certain magisterial proceedings which were reported with justifiable gusto and huge headlines in the newspapers aforesaid and this was all one knew of reuben rosenthall up to the time when the old bohemian club having fallen on evil days found it worth its while to organize a great dinner in honor of so wealthy an exponent of the club's principles i was not at the banquet myself but a member took raffles who told me all about it that very night most extraordinary show i ever went to in my life said he as for the man himself well i was prepared for something grotesque but the fellow fairly took my breath away to begin with he's the most astounding brute to look at well over six feet with a chest like a barrel and a great hook nose and the reddest hair and whiskers you ever saw drank like a fire engine but only got drunk enough to make us a speech that i wouldn't have missed for ten pounds i'm only sorry you weren't there too bunny old chap i began to be sorry myself for raffles was anything but an excitable person and never had i seen him so excited before had he been following rosenthall's example his coming to my rooms at midnight merely to tell me about his dinner was in itself enough to excuse a suspicion which was certainly at variance with my knowledge of a j raffles what did he say i inquired mechanically divining some subtler explanation of this visit and wondering what on earth it could be say cried raffles what did he not say he boasted of his rise he bragged of his riches and he blackguarded society for taking him up for his money and dropping him out of sheer pique and jealousy because he had so much he mentioned names too with the most charming freedom and swore he was as good a man as the old country had to show pace the old bohemians to prove it he pointed to a great diamond in the middle of his shirt front with a little finger loaded with another just like it which of our bloated princes could show a pair like that as a matter of fact they seemed quite wonderful stones with a curious purple gleam to them that must mean a pot of money but old rosenthall swore he wouldn't take fifty thousand pounds for the two and wanted to know where the other man was who went about with twenty five thousand in his shirt front and another twenty five on his little finger he didn't exist if he did he wouldn't have the pluck to wear them but he had he'd tell us why and before you could say jack robinson he had whipped out a whacking great revolver not at the table at the table in the middle of his speech but it was nothing to what he wanted to do he actually wanted us to let him write his name in bullets on the opposite wall to show us why he wasn't afraid to go about in all his diamonds that brute purvis the prize fighter who is his paid bully had to bully his master before he could be persuaded out of it there was quite a panic for the moment one fellow was saying his prayers under the table and the waiters bolted to a man what a grotesque scene grotesque enough but i rather wish they had let him go the whole hog and blaze away he was as keen as knives to show us how he could take care of his purple diamonds and do you know bunny _i_ was as keen as knives to see and raffles leaned towards me with a sly slow smile that made the hidden meaning of his visit only too plain to me at last so you think of having a try for his diamonds yourself he shrugged his shoulders it is horribly obvious i admit but yes i have set my heart upon them to be quite frank i have had them on my conscience for some time one couldn't hear so much of the man and his prize fighter and his diamonds without feeling it a kind of duty to have a go for them but when it comes to brandishing a revolver and practically challenging the world the thing becomes inevitable it is simply thrust upon one i was fated to hear that challenge bunny and i for one must take it up i was only sorry i couldn't get on my hind legs and say so then and there well i said i don't see the necessity as things are with us but of course i'm your man my tone may have been half hearted i did my best to make it otherwise but it was barely a month since our bond street exploit and we certainly could have afforded to behave ourselves for some time to come we had been getting along so nicely by his advice i had scribbled a thing or two inspired by raffles i had even done an article on our own jewel robbery and for the moment i was quite satisfied with this sort of adventure i thought we ought to know when we were well off and could see no point in our running fresh risks before we were obliged on the other hand i was anxious not to show the least disposition to break the pledge that i had given a month ago but it was not on my manifest disinclination that raffles fastened necessity my dear bunny does the writer only write when the wolf is at the door does the painter paint for bread alone must you and i be driven to crime like tom of bow and dick of whitechapel you pain me my dear chap you needn't laugh because you do art for art's sake is a vile catchword but i confess it appeals to me in this case my motives are absolutely pure for i doubt if we shall ever be able to dispose of such peculiar stones but if i don't have a try for them after to night i shall never be able to hold up my head again his eye twinkled but it glittered too we shall have our work cut out was all i said and do you suppose i should be keen on it if we hadn't cried raffles my dear fellow i would rob st paul's cathedral if i could but i could no more scoop a till when the shopwalker wasn't looking than i could bag the apples out of an old woman's basket even that little business last month was a sordid affair but it was necessary and i think its strategy redeemed it to some extent now there's some credit and more sport in going where they boast they're on their guard against you the bank of england for example is the ideal crib but that would need half a dozen of us with years to give to the job and meanwhile reuben rosenthall is high enough game for you and me we know he's armed we know how billy purvis can fight it'll be no soft thing i grant you but what of that my good bunny what of that a man's reach must exceed his grasp dear boy or what the dickens is a heaven for i would rather we didn't exceed ours just yet i answered laughing for his spirit was irresistible and the plan was growing upon me despite my qualms trust me for that was his reply i'll see you through after all i expect to find that the difficulties are nearly all on the surface these fellows both drink like the devil and that should simplify matters considerably but we shall see and we must take our time there will probably turn out to be a dozen different ways in which the thing might be done and we shall have to choose between them it will mean watching the house for at least a week in any case it may mean lots of other things that will take much longer but give me a week and i will tell you more that's to say if you're really on of course i am i replied indignantly but why should i give you a week why shouldn't we watch the house together because two eyes are as good as four and take up less room never hunt in couples unless you're obliged but don't you look offended bunny there'll be plenty for you to do when the time comes that i promise you you shall have your share of the fun never fear and a purple diamond all to yourself if we're lucky on the whole however this conversation left me less than lukewarm and i still remember the depression which came upon me when raffles was gone i saw the folly of the enterprise to which i had committed myself the sheer gratuitous unnecessary folly of it and the paradoxes in which raffles revelled and the frivolous casuistry which was nevertheless half sincere and which his mere personality rendered wholly plausible at the moment of utterance appealed very little to me when recalled in cold blood i admired the spirit of pure mischief in which he seemed prepared to risk his liberty and his life but i did not find it an infectious spirit on calm reflection yet the thought of withdrawal was not to be entertained for a moment on the contrary i was impatient of the delay ordained by raffles and perhaps no small part of my secret disaffection came of his galling determination to do without me until the last moment it made it no better that this was characteristic of the man and of his attitude towards me for a month we had been i suppose the thickest thieves in all london and yet our intimacy was curiously incomplete with all his charming frankness there was in raffles a vein of capricious reserve which was perceptible enough to be very irritating he had the instinctive secretiveness of the inveterate criminal he would make mysteries of matters of common concern for example i never knew how or where he disposed of the bond street jewels on the proceeds of which we were both still leading the outward lives of hundreds of other young fellows about town he was consistently mysterious about that and other details of which it seemed to me that i had already earned the right to know everything i could not but remember how he had led me into my first felony by means of a trick while yet uncertain whether he could trust me or not that i could no longer afford to resent but i did resent his want of confidence in me now i said nothing about it but it rankled every day and never more than in the week that succeeded the rosenthall dinner when i met raffles at the club he would tell me nothing when i went to his rooms he was out or pretended to be one day he told me he was getting on well but slowly it was a more ticklish game than he had thought but when i began to ask questions he would say no more then and there in my annoyance i took my own decision since he would tell me nothing of the result of his vigils i determined to keep one on my own account and that very evening found my way to the millionaire's front gates the house he was occupying is i believe quite the largest in the st john's wood district it stands in the angle formed by two broad thoroughfares neither of which as it happens is a bus route and i doubt if many quieter spots exist within the four mile radius quiet also was the great square house in its garden of grass plots and shrubs the lights were low the millionaire and his friends obviously spending their evening elsewhere the garden walls were only a"
