"1" "water and injins and such and the long haired buckskin fakes they picked up at santa fe for guides wasn't much better that was where texas pete made his killing texas pete was a tough citizen from the lone star he was about as broad as he was long and wore all sorts of big whiskers and black eyebrows his heart was very bad you never could tell where texas pete was goin to jump next he was a side winder and a diamond back and a little black rattlesnake all rolled into one i believe that texas pete person cared about as little for killin a man as for takin a drink and he shorely drank without an effort peaceable citizens just spoke soft and minded their own business onpeaceable citizens texas pete used to plant out in the sagebrush now this texas pete happened to discover a water hole right out in the plumb middle of the desert he promptly annexed said water hole digs her out timbers her up and lays for emigrants he charged two bits a head man or beast and nobody got a mouthful till he paid up in hard coin think of the wads he raked in i used to figure it up just for the joy of envyin him i reckon an average twenty wagon outfit first and last would bring him in somewheres about fifty dollars and besides he had forty rod at four bits a glass and outfits at that time were thicker'n spatter we used all to go down sometimes to watch them come in when they see that little canvas shack and that well they begun to cheer up and move fast and when they see that sign water two bits a head their eyes stuck out like two raw oysters then come the kicks what a howl they did raise shorely but it didn't do no manner of good texas pete didn't do nothin but sit there and smoke with a kind of sulky gleam in one corner of his eye he didn't even take the trouble to answer but his winchester lay across his lap there wasn't no humour in the situation for him how much is your water for humans asks one emigrant can't you read that sign texas pete asks him but you don't mean two bits a head for humans yells the man why you can get whisky for that you can read the sign can't you insists texas pete i can read it all right says the man tryin a new deal but they tell me not to believe more'n half i read but that don't go and mr emigrant shells out with the rest i didn't blame them for raisin their howl why at that time the regular water holes was chargin five cents a head from the government freighters and the motto was always hold up uncle sam at that once in a while some outfit would get mad and go chargin off dry but it was a long long way to the springs and mighty hot and dusty texas pete and his one lonesome water hole shorely did a big business late one afternoon me and gentleman tim was joggin along above texas pete's place it was a tur'ble hot day you had to prime yourself to spit and we was just gettin back from drivin some beef up to the troops at fort huachuca we was due to cross the emigrant trail she's wore in tur'ble deep you can see the ruts to day when we topped the rise we see a little old outfit just makin out to drag along it was one little schooner all by herself drug along by two poor old cavallos that couldn't have pulled my hat off their tongues was out and every once in a while they'd stick in a chuck hole then a man would get down and put his shoulder to the wheel and everybody'd take a heave and up they'd come all a trembling and weak tim and i rode down just to take a look at the curiosity a thin lookin man was drivin all humped up hullo stranger says i ain't you fraid of injins yes says he then why are you travellin through an injin country all alone couldn't keep up says he can i get water here i reckon i answers he drove up to the water trough there at texas pete's me and gentleman tim followin along because our trail led that way but he hadn't more'n stopped before texas pete was out cost you four bits to water them hosses says he the man looked up kind of bewildered i'm sorry says he i ain't got no four bits i got my roll lifted off'n me no water then growls texas pete back at him the man looked about him helpless how far is it to the next water he asks me twenty mile i tells him my god he says to himself like then he shrugged his shoulders very tired all right it's gettin the cool of the evenin we'll make it he turns into the inside of that old schooner gi me the cup sue a white faced woman who looked mighty good to us alkalis opened the flaps and gave out a tin cup which the man pointed out to fill how many of you is they asks texas pete three replies the man wondering well six bits then says texas pete cash down at that the man straightens up a little i ain't askin for no water for my stock says he but my wife and baby has been out in this sun all day without a drop of water our cask slipped a hoop and bust just this side of dos cabesas the poor kid is plumb dry two bits a head says texas pete at that the woman comes out a little bit of a baby in her arms the kid had fuzzy yellow hair and its face was flushed red and shiny shorely you won't refuse a sick child a drink of water sir says she but texas pete had some sort of a special grouch i guess he was just beginning to get his snowshoes off after a fight with his own forty rod what the hell are you all doin on the trail without no money at all he growls and how do you expect to get along such plumb tenderfeet drive me weary well says the man still reasonable i ain't got no money but i'll give you six bits worth of flour or trade or an'thin i got i don't run no truck store snaps texas pete and turns square on his heel and goes back to his chair got six bits about you whispers gentleman tim to me not a red i answers gentleman tim turns to texas pete let em have a drink pete i'll pay you next time i come down cash down growls pete you're the meanest man i ever see observes tim i wouldn't speak to you if i met you in hell carryin a lump of ice in your hand you're the softest _i_ ever see sneers pete don't they have any genooine texans down your way not enough to make it disagreeable says tim that lets you out growls pete gettin hostile and handlin of his rifle which the man had been standin there bewildered the cup hangin from his finger at last lookin pretty desperate he stooped down to dig up a little of the wet from an overflow puddle lyin at his feet at the same time the hosses left sort of to themselves and bein drier than a covered bridge drug forward and stuck their noses in the trough gentleman tim and me was sittin there on our hosses a little to one side we saw texas pete jump up from his chair take a quick aim and cut loose with his rifle it was plumb unexpected to us we hadn't thought of any shootin and our six shooters was tied in count of the jumpy country we'd been drivin the steers over but gentleman tim who had unslung his rope aimin to help the hosses out of the chuckhole snatched her off the horn and with one of the prettiest twenty foot flip throws i ever see done he snaked old texas pete right out of his wicky up gun and all the old renegade did his best to twist around for a shot at us but it was no go and i never enjoyed hog tying a critter more in my life than i enjoyed hog tying texas pete then we turned to see what damage had been done we were some relieved to find the family all right but texas pete had bored one of them poor old crow bait hosses plumb through the head it's lucky for you you don't get the old man says gentleman tim very quiet and polite which gentleman tim was an irishman and i'd been on the range long enough with him to know that when he got quiet and polite it was time to dodge behind something i hope sir says he to the stranger that you will give your wife and baby a satisfying drink as for your hoss pray do not be under any apprehension our friend mr texas pete here has kindly consented to make good any deficiencies from his own corral tim could talk high wide and handsome when he set out to the man started to say something but i managed to herd him to one side let him alone i whispers when he talks that way he's mad and when he's mad it's better to leave nature to supply the lightnin rods he seemed to sabe all right so we built us a little fire and started some grub while gentleman tim walked up and down very grand and fierce by and by he seemed to make up his mind he went over and untied texas pete stand up you hound says he now listen to me if you make a break to get away or if you refuse to do just as i tell you i won't shoot you but i'll march you up country and see that geronimo gets you he sorted out a shovel and pick made texas pete carry them right along the trail a quarter and started him to diggin a hole texas pete started in hard enough tim sittin over him on his hoss his six shooter loose and his rope free the man and i stood by not darin to say a word after a minute or so texas pete began to work slower and slower by and by he stopped look here says he is this here thing my grave i am goin to see that you give the gentleman's hoss decent interment says gentleman tim very polite bury a hoss growls texas pete but he didn't say any more tim cocked his six shooter perhaps you'd better quit panting and sweat a little says he texas pete worked hard for a while for tim's quietness was beginning to scare him up the worst way by and by he had got down maybe four or five feet and tim got off his hoss i think that will do says he you may come out billy my son cover him now mr texas pete he says cold as steel there is the grave we will place the hoss in it then i intend to shoot you and put you in with the hoss and write you an epitaph that will be a comfort to such travellers of the trail as are honest and a warnin to such as are not i'd as soon kill you now as an hour from now so you may make a break for it if you feel like it he stooped over to look into the hole i thought he looked an extra long time but when he raised his head his face had changed complete march says he very brisk we all went back to the shack from the corral tim took texas pete's best team and hitched her to the old schooner there says he to the man now you'd better hit the trail take that whisky keg there for water good bye we sat there without sayin a word for some time after the schooner had pulled out then tim says very abrupt i've changed my mind he got up come on billy says he to me we'll just leave our friend tied up i'll be back to morrow to turn you loose in the meantime it won't hurt you a bit to be a little uncomfortable and hungry and thirsty we rode off just about sundown leavin texas pete lashed tight now all this knocked me hell west and crooked and i said so but i couldn't get a word out of gentleman tim all the answer i could get was just little laughs we drawed into the ranch near midnight but next mornin tim had a long talk with the boss and the result was that the whole outfit was instructed to arm up with a pick or a shovel apiece and to get set for texas pete's we got there a little after noon turned the old boy out without firearms and then began to dig at a place tim told us to near that grave of texas pete's in three hours we had the finest water hole developed you ever want to see then the boss stuck up a sign that said public water hole water free now you old skin says he to texas pete charge all you want to on your own property but if i ever hear of your layin claim to this other hole i'll shore make you hard to catch then we rode off home you see when gentleman tim inspected that grave he noted indications of water and it struck him that runnin the old renegade out of business was a neater way of gettin even than merely killin him somebody threw a fresh mesquite on the fire the flames leaped up again showing a thin trickle of water running down the other side of the cave the steady downpour again made itself prominent through the re established silence what did texas pete do after that asked the cattleman texas pete chuckled windy bill well he put in a heap of his spare time lettin tim alone chapter three the remittance man after windy bill had finished his story we began to think it time to turn in uncle jim and charley slid and slipped down the chute like passage leading from the cave and disappeared in the direction of the overhang beneath which they had spread their bed after a moment we tore off long bundles of the nigger head blades lit the resinous ends at our fire and with these torches started to make our way along the base of the cliff to the other cave once without the influence of the fire our impromptu links cast an adequate light the sheets of rain became suddenly visible as they entered the circle of illumination by careful scrutiny of the footing i gained the entrance to our cave without mishap i looked back here and there irregularly gleamed and spluttered my companions torches across each slanted the rain all else was of inky blackness except where between them and me a faint red reflection shone on the wet rocks then i turned inside now to judge from the crumbling powder of the footing that cave had been dry since noah in fact its roof was nearly a thousand feet thick but since we had spread our blankets the persistent waters had soaked down and through the thousand foot roof had a sprung a leak three separate and distinct streams of water ran as from spigots i lowered my torch the canvas tarpaulin shone with wet and in its exact centre glimmered a pool of water three inches deep and at least two feet in diameter well i'll be i began then i remembered those three wending their way along a wet and disagreeable trail happy and peaceful in anticipation of warm blankets and a level floor i chuckled and sat on my heels out of the drip first came jed parker his head bent to protect the fire in his pipe he gained the very centre of the cave before he looked up then he cast one glance at each bed and one at me his grave hawk like features relaxed a faint grin appeared under his long moustache without a word he squatted down beside me next the cattleman he looked about him with a comical expression of dismay and burst into a hearty laugh i believe i said i was sorry for those other fellows he remarked windy bill was the last he stooped his head to enter straightened his lank figure and took in the situation without expression well this is handy said he i was gettin tur'ble dry and was thinkin i would have to climb way down to the creek in all this rain he stooped to the pool in the centre of the tarpaulin and drank but now our torches began to run low a small dry bush grew near the entrance we ignited it and while it blazed we hastily sorted a blanket apiece and tumbled the rest out of the drip our return without torches along the base of that butte was something to remember the night was so thick you could feel the darkness pressing on you the mountain dropped abruptly to the left and was strewn with boulders and blocks of stone collisions and stumbles were frequent once i stepped off a little ledge five or six feet nothing worse than a barked shin and all the while the rain pelting us unmercifully searched out what poor little remnants of dryness we had been able to retain at last we opened out the gleam of fire in our cave and a minute later were engaged in struggling desperately up the slant that brought us to our ledge and the slope on which our fire burned my lord panted windy bill a man had ought to have hooks on his eyebrows to climb up here we renewed the fire and blessed the back load of mesquite we had packed up earlier in the evening our blankets we wrapped around our shoulders our feet we hung over the ledge toward the blaze our backs we leaned against the hollow slant of the cave's wall we were not uncomfortable the beat of the rain sprang up in the darkness growing louder and louder like horsemen passing on a hard road gradually we dozed off for a time everything was pleasant dreams came fused with realities the firelight faded from consciousness or returned fantastic to our half awakening a delicious numbness overspread our tired bodies the shadows leaped became solid monstrous we fell asleep after a time the fact obtruded itself dimly through our stupor that the constant pressure of the hard rock had impeded our circulation we stirred uneasily shifting to a better position that was the beginning of awakening the new position did not suit a slight shivering seized us which the drawing closer of the blanket failed to end finally i threw aside my hat and looked out jed parker a vivid patch work comforter wrapped about his shoulders stood upright and silent by the fire i kept still fearing to awaken the others in a short time i became aware that the others were doing identically the same thing we laughed threw off our blankets stretched and fed the fire a thick acrid smoke filled the air the cattleman rising left a trail of incandescent footprints we investigated hastily and discovered that the supposed earth on the slant of the cave was nothing more than bat guano tons of it the fire eating its way beneath had rendered untenable its immediate vicinity we felt as though we were living over a volcano how soon our ledge of the same material might be attacked we had no means of knowing overcome with drowsiness we again disposed our blankets resolved to get as many naps as possible before even these constrained quarters were taken from us this happened sooner and in a manner otherwise than we had expected windy bill brought us to consciousness by a wild yell consciousness reported to us a strange hurried sound like the long roll on a drum investigation showed us that this cave too had sprung a leak not with any premonitory drip but all at once as though someone had turned on a faucet in ten seconds a very competent streamlet six inches wide had eroded a course down through the guano past the fire and to the outer slope and by the irony of fate that one and only one leak in all the roof expanse of a big cave was directly over one end of our tiny ledge the cattleman laughed reminds me of the old farmer and his kind friend said he kind friend hunts up the old farmer in the village john says he i've bad news for you your barn has burned up my lord says the farmer but that ain't the worst your cow was burned too my lord says the farmer but that ain't the worst your horses were burned my lord says the farmer but that ain't the worst the barn set fire to the house and it was burned total loss my lord groans the farmer but that ain't the worst your wife and child were killed too at that the farmer began to roar with laughter good heavens man cries his friend astonished what in the world do you find to laugh at in that don't you see answers the farmer why it's so darn complete well finished the cattleman that's what strikes me about our case it's so darn complete what time is it asked windy bill midnight i announced lord six hours to day groaned windy bill how'd you like to be doin a nice quiet job at gardenin in the east where you could belly up to the bar reg'lar every evenin and drink a pussy cafe and smoke tailor made cigareets you wouldn't like it a bit put in the cattleman with decision whereupon in proof he told us the following story windy has mentioned gentleman tim and that reminded me of the first time i ever saw him he was an irishman all right but he had been educated in england and except for his accent he was more an englishman than anything else a freight outfit brought him into tucson from santa fe and dumped him down on the plaza where at once every idler in town gathered to quiz him certainly he was one of the greenest specimens i ever saw in this country he had on a pair of balloon pants and a norfolk jacket and was surrounded by a half dozen baby trunks his face was red cheeked and aggressively clean and his eye limpid as a child's most of those present thought that indicated childishness but i could see that it was only utter self unconsciousness it seemed that he was out for big game and intended to go after silver tips somewhere in these very mountains of course he was offered plenty of advice and would probably have made engagements much to be regretted had i not taken a strong fancy to him my friend said i drawing him aside i don't want to be inquisitive but what might you do when you're home i'm a younger son said he i was green myself in those days and knew nothing of primogeniture that is a very interesting piece of family history said i but it does not answer my question he smiled well now i hadn't thought of that said he but in a manner of speaking it does i do nothing well said i unabashed if you saw me trying to be a younger son and likely to forget myself and do something without meaning to wouldn't you be apt to warn me well pon honour you're a queer chap what do you mean i mean that if you hire any of those men to guide you in the mountains you'll be outrageously cheated and will be lucky if you're not gobbled by apaches do you do any guiding yourself now he asked most innocent of manner but i flared up you damn ungrateful pup i said go to the devil in your own way and turned square on my heel but the young man was at my elbow his hand on my shoulder oh i say now i'm sorry i didn't rightly understand do wait one moment until i dispose of these boxes of mine and then i want the honour of your further acquaintance he got some greasers to take his trunks over to the hotel then linked his arm in mine most engagingly now my dear chap said he let's go somewhere for a b s and find out about each other we were both young and expansive we exchanged views names and confidences and before noon we had arranged to hunt together i to collect the outfit the upshot of the matter was that the honourable timothy clare and i had a most excellent month's excursion shot several good bear and returned to tucson the best of friends at tucson was schiefflein and his stories of a big strike down in the apache country nothing would do but that we should both go to see for ourselves we joined the second expedition crept in the gullies tied bushes about ourselves when monumenting corners and so helped establish the town of tombstone we made nothing nor attempted to neither of us knew anything of mining but we were both thirsty for adventure and took a schoolboy delight in playing the game of life or death with the chiricahuas in fact i never saw anybody take to the wild life as eagerly as the honourable timothy clare he wanted to attempt everything with him it was no sooner see than try and he had such an abundance of enthusiasm that he generally succeeded the balloon pants soon went in a month his outfit was irreproachable he used to study us by the hour taking in every detail of our equipment from the smallest to the most important then he asked questions for all his desire to be one of the country he was never ashamed to acknowledge his ignorance now don't you chaps think it silly to wear such high heels to your boots he would ask it seems to me a very useless sort of vanity no vanity about it tim i explained in the first place it keeps your foot from slipping through the stirrup in the second place it is good to grip on the ground when you're roping afoot by jove that's true he cried so he'd get him a pair of boots for a while it was enough to wear and own all these things he seemed to delight in his six shooter and his rope just as ornaments to himself and horse but he soon got over that then he had to learn to use them for the time being pistol practice for instance would absorb all his thoughts he'd bang away at intervals all day and figure out new theories all night that bally scheme won't work he would complain i believe if i extended my thumb along the cylinder it would help that side jump he was always easing the trigger pull or filing the sights in time he got to be a fairly accurate and very quick shot the same way with roping and hog tying and all the rest what's the use i used to ask him if you were going to be a buckeroo you couldn't go into harder training i like it was always his answer he had only one real vice that i could see he would gamble stud poker was his favourite and i never saw a britisher yet who could play poker i used to head him off when i could and he was always grateful but the passion was strong after we got back from founding tombstone i was busted and had to go to work i've got plenty said tim and it's all yours i know old fellow i told him but your money wouldn't do for me buck johnson was just seeing his chance then and was preparing to take some breeding cattle over into the soda springs valley everybody laughed at him said it was right in the line of the chiricahua raids which was true but buck had been in there with agency steers and thought he knew so he collected a trail crew brought some oregon cattle across and built his home ranch of three foot adobe walls with portholes i joined the trail crew and somehow or another the honourable timothy got permission to go along on his own hook the trail was a long one we had thirst and heat and stampedes and some indian scares but in the queer atmospheric conditions that prevailed that summer i never saw the desert more wonderful it was like waking to the glory of god to sit up at dawn and see the colours change on the dry ranges at the home ranch again tim managed to get permission to stay on he kept his own mount of horses took care"
