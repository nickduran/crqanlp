she'll forgive me i know and be patient a while longer it's all for her sake i'm staying away give her the letter i enclose your old bunkie dick lane chapter ii the heart of a girl jim allen was the sole owner and proprietor of allen hacienda his ranch the bar one stretched for miles up and down the sweetwater valley bounded on the east and west by the foot hills the tract was one of the garden spots of arizona southward lay the sweetwater ranch owned by jack payson northward was the home ranch of the lazy k an ishmaelitish outfit ever at petty war with the other settlers in the district it was a miscellaneous and constantly changing crowd recruited from rustlers from wyoming gamblers from california half breed outlaws from the indian territory in short bad men from every section of the western country they had a special grudge against allen and payson whom they held to be accountable for the sudden disappearance about a year before of their leader buck mckee a half breed from the cherokee strip however no other leader had arisen equal to that masterful spirit and their enmity expressed itself only in such petty depredations as changing brands on stray cattle from the bar one and sweetwater ranches and the slitting of the tongues of young calves so that they would be unable to feed properly and as a result be disowned by their mothers whereupon the lazy k outfit would slap its brand on them as mavericks allen was a kentuckian who had served in the confederate army as one of morgan's raiders and so had received by popular brevet the title of colonel at the close of the war he had come to arizona with his young wife josephine and had founded a home on the sweetwater he was now one of the cattle barons of the great southwest prosperity had not spoiled him careless in his attire cordial in his manner he was a man who was loved and respected by his men from the newest tenderfoot to the veteran of the bunkhouse his wife however was not so highly regarded for she had never been able to recognize changes in time or location and so was in perpetual conflict with her environment she attempted to make the free and independent cowboys of the arizona plains stand around like the house servants of the kentucky bluegrass and she persisted in the effort to manage her husband by the feminine artifice of weeping in days of her youth and beauty this had been very effective but now that these had passed it was productive only of good humored raillery from him and mirth from the bystanders no wonder jim has the finest ranch in arizony the cowboys were wont to say with josephine a irrigatin it all the time allen hacienda was certainly a garden spot in that desert country the building was of the old mexican style an architecture found by centuries of experience to be suited best to the climate and the materials of the land the house was only one story in height the rooms and outbuildings sprawled over a wide expanse of ground the walls were of native stone and adobe clay over them clambered grape vines in front of the home mrs allen had planted a garden a dobe wall cut off the house from the corral and the bunk house a heavy girder spanned the distance from the low roof to the top of the barrier latticework supporting a grape vine formed with a girder a gateway through which one could catch from the piazza a view of a second cultivated plot palms and flowering cacti added color and life to the near prospect through the arbor a glimpse of the tortilla mountains forty miles away held the eye the sweetwater its path across the plains outlined by the trees fringing its banks flowed past the ranch yucca palms and sahuaroes threw a scanty shade over the garden shortly after the arrival of the allens in arizona they were blessed with a daughter the first white child born in that region they waited for a protestant clergyman to come along before christening her and as such visits were few and far between the child was beginning to talk before she received a name from a cunning habit she had of repeating last words of questions put to her her father provisionally dubbed her echo which name when the preacher came he insisted upon her retaining as echo grew older in order that she might have a companion colonel allen went to kentucky and brought back with him a little orphan girl who was a distant relative of his wife polly hope her name was and polly hope she insisted on remaining though the allens would gladly have adopted her colonel allen trained the girls in all the craft of the plains just as if they were boys he taught them to ride astride to shoot to rope cattle they accompanied him everywhere he went cantering on broncos by the side of his kentucky thoroughbred merry dark eyed black haired echo always rode upon the off side and saucy polly with golden curls blue eyes and tip tilted nose upon the near the ex confederate soldier dubbed them in military style his right and left wings as the three would make a raid upon florence the county town the inhabitants did not need to look out of doors to ascertain who were coming for the merriment of the little girls gave sufficient indication here comes jim allen ridin like the destroyin angel said young sheriff hoover on one of these occasions i know him by the rustlin of his wings the household was again increased a few years later by the generous response of the allens to an appeal from a children's aid society in an eastern city to give a home to two orphaned brothers richard and henry lane dick and buddy shortened in time to bud as they were called being taken young quickly adapted themselves to their new environment and by the time they arrived at manhood had proved themselves the equals of any cowboy on the range in horsemanship and kindred accomplishments dick the elder brother was a steady reliable fellow modest as he was brave and remarkably quick witted and resourceful in emergencies he gave his confidence over readily to his fellows but if he ever found himself deceived withdrew it absolutely it was probably this last characteristic that attracted to him echo allen's especial regard for it was also her distinguishing trait you have got to act square with echo her father was wont to say for if you don't you'll never make it square with her afterward bud was a generous hearted impetuous boy who responded warmly to affection he repaid his elder brother's protecting care with a loyalty that knew no bounds the colonel who was a strict disciplinarian frequently punished him in his boyhood for wayward acts and the little fellow made no resistance only sobbed in deep penitence once however when uncle jim as the boys and polly called him felt compelled to apply to rod to dick unjustly as it afterward appeared bud burst into a tempest of passionate tears and leaping upon the colonel's back clung there clawing and striking like a wildcat until allen was forced to let dick go it is shrewdly indicative of the colonel's character that not only did he refrain from punishing bud on that occasion but when floggings were subsequently due the little fellow laid on the rod less heavily out of regard for the loyalty to his brother he had then displayed this attack also won the admiration of polly hope who was something of a spitfire herself a little jealous of dick for the chief place he held in bud's affection she openly claimed the younger brother as her sweetheart and attempted to constitute him her knight though with repeated discouragements for bud was a bashful lad and though he had a true affection for the girl boylike concealed it by a show of indifference the tender relations of these boys and girls persisted naturally into young manhood and womanhood no word of love passed between dick and echo until that time when the nesting impulse the desire to have a home of his own prompted the young man to go out into the world and win his fortune for a year he had acted as foreman of the allen ranch working in neighborly cooperation with jack payson of sweetwater ranch a man of about his own age the two young men became the closest of comrades when the fever of adventure seized upon lane and he became dissatisfied with the plodding career of a wage earner payson insisted on mortgaging sweetwater ranch for three thousand dollars and in lending dick the money for a year's prospecting in the mountains of sonora mexico in search of a fabulous rich lost mine of the aztecs traditions of lost mines are plentiful in arizona and northern mexico first taken up by the spanish invaders of three hundred years ago from the native indians they have been passed down to each subsequent influx of white men the directions are always vague the inquirer cannot pin his informant down to any definite data over the mountains always lies the road hundreds of lives have been sacrificed and cruelty unparalleled practised upon innocent men women and children by gold seekers in their lust for conquest prosperous indian villages have been laid waste and whole bands of adventurers have gone into the desert in the search of these mines never to return when the time for lane's departure came echo wept at the thought of losing for so long a time the close companion of her childhood and the sympathetic confidant of her youthful thoughts and aspirations dick in whom friendship for echo had long before ripened into conscious love took her tears as evidence that she was similarly affected toward him and he allowed all the suppressed passion of his nature full vent in a declaration of love the girl was deeply moved by this revelation of the heart of a strong man made tender as a woman's by a power centering in her own humble self and being utterly without experience of the emotion even in its protective form of calf love which is the varioloid of the genuine infection she imagined through sheer sympathy that she shared his passion so she assented with maidenly reserve to his plea that she promise to marry him when he should return and provide a home for her her more cautious mother secured a modification of this pledge by limiting the time that echo should wait for him to one year if at the expiration of that period lane did not return to claim her promise or did not write making satisfactory arrangements for continuance of the engagement echo was to be considered free to marry whom she chose soon after lane's departure mrs allen persuaded the colonel to send echo east to a new england finishing school for girls where her mother hoped that her budding love for lane might be nipped in the frigid atmosphere of intellectual culture if not indeed supplanted by a saving interest in young men in general and perhaps in some particular scion of a blue blooded boston family the plan succeeded in part only the companionship of her schoolfellows her music and art lessons her books during the limited periods allotted to serious study and reading and above all her attrition at receptions with another order of men than that she had known in the rough uncultured west occupied her mind so fully that poor dick lane who was putting a thought of echo allen in every blow of his pick received only the scraps of her attention dick had few opportunities to mail a letter and none of them for receiving one unpractised in writing his epistolary compositions were crude in the extreme being wholly confined to bald statements of fact had he been as tender on paper as he was in his words and accents when he kissed away her tears at parting her regard for him would have had fuel to feed on and might have kindled into genuine love as it was she was forced to admit that in comparison with the brilliant university men with whom she conversed dick lane intellectually was as quartz to diamond on the other band she contrasted dick in the essential point of manliness most favorably with the male butterflies of society that hovered around her what one of them was so essentially chivalrous as the western man so modest so self sacrificing so brave and resolute and resourceful dick lane or jack payson for that matter in all save the adventitious points of education and culture was the higher type of manhood and jack at least if not poor dick could hold his own in mental and artistic perception with the brightest most cultured of harvard graduates at the end of the year she came back home to await dick's return from the wilds of mexico there was great anxiety about his safety for geronimo attacked by crook in the apache stronghold of the tonto basin had escaped to the mountains of northwestern mexico with his band of fierce chiricahuas now dick lane had not been heard from in this region when he neither made appearance nor sent a message upon the day appointed for his return his brother bud was for setting out instantly to find him and rescue him if he were in difficulties then it was that echo allen discovered the true nature of her affection for her lover that it was sisterly regard differing only in degree but not in kind from that which she felt for his brother she joined with polly in opposing bud's going urging his recklessness as a reason you are certain to be killed she said and i cannot lose you both jack payson for whom bud was working then came forward and offered to accompany him and keep him with bounds again there was a revelation of her heart echo and one that terrified her with a sense of disloyalty it was jack she really loved noble chivalric wonderful jack payson whom with a southern intensity of feeling she had unconsciously come to regard as her standard of all that makes for manhood plausible objections could not be urged against his sacrificing himself for his friend with an irresistible impulse she cast herself upon his breast and said i cannot bear to see you go payson gently disengaged her arms i must echo it is what dick would do for me if i were in his place however while payson and bud were preparing for their departure buck mckee appeared in the region and reported that dick lane had been killed by the apaches he told with convincing details of how he had met lane as each was returning from a successful prospecting trip in the ghost range and how they had sunk their differences in standing together against an attack of the indians he extolled dick's bravery relating how severely wounded he had stood off the savages to enable himself to escape when he handed over dick's watch to echo for he had learned on his return that she was betrothed to lane as a last token from her lover no doubt remained in the minds of his hearers of the truth of his story and payson and bud lane gave up their purposed expedition the owner of sweetwater ranch while accepting mckee's account could not wholly forget the half breed's former evil reputation and was reserved in his reception of the advances of the ex rustler who was anxious to curry favor warm hearted impulsive bud however whose fraternal loyalty had increased under his bereavement to the supreme passion of life took the insinuating half breed into the aching vacancy made by his brother's death the two became boon companions to the great detriment of the younger man's morals mckee had plenty of money which he spent liberally gambling and carousing in company with bud polly was wild with indignation at her sweetheart's desertion and savagely upbraided him for his conduct whenever they met which may be inferred grew less and less frequently it was in revenge she made advances to another man who long loved her from afar this was william henry harrison hoover sheriff of the county known as slim hoover by the humorous propensity of men on the range to give nicknames on the principle of contraries for he was fattest man in pinal county slim was one of those fleshy men who have nerves of steel and muscles of iron a round boyish face twinkling blue eyes flaming red hair gave him an appearance entirely at variance with his personality a vein of sentiment made him all the more lovable his associates ranchers men of the plains soldiers and the owners and frequenters of the frontier barroom respected him greatly he's square as slim was the best recommendation ever given of a man in that region pinal county settlers had made slim sheriff term after term because he was the one citizen supremely fitted for the place he had ridden the range and busted broncos before election after it he hunted wrong doers right was right and wrong was wrong to him there was no shading in the meaning all he asked of men was to ride fast shoot straight and deal squarely in any game he admitted that murder horse stealing and branding another man's calves were subjects for the unwritten law but in his code this law meant death only after a fair trial with neighbors for a jury he was not scrupulous that a judge should be present his duties were ended when he brought in his prisoner hoover's rule had been marked by the taming of bad men in florence and a truce declared in the guerrilla warfare between the cattlemen and the sheepmen on the range slim's seemingly superfluous flesh was really of great advantage to him it served as a mask for his remarkable athletic abilities and so lulled the outlaws with whom he had to deal into a false sense of superiority and security slow and lethargic in his ordinary movements in an emergency he was quick as a panther never failing to get the drop on his man furthermore his fat exerted a beneficial influence on his character in keeping him humble minded being the most popular man in the county he would probably have been swollen with vanity had there been any space left vacant for it in his huge frame he was especially admired by the women but was at ease only in the company of those who were married it was his fate to see the few girls of the region with every one of whom by turns he was in love grow up to marry each some less diffident wooer dangnation take it he used to say i don't git up enough spunk to cut a heifer out o the herd until somebody else has roped her and slapped his brand onto her talk about too many irons in the fire why i've only got one and it's het up red all the time waitin fer the right chanct to use it but some how i never git it out o the coals hell what's the use anyhow nobody loves a fat man slim was inordinately puffed up by polly's preference of him which she showed by all sorts of feminine tyrannies and he was forced continually to slap his huge paunch to remind himself of what he considered his disabling deformity miss polly he would apostrophize the absent lady you don't know what a volcano of seethin fiery love this here mountain of flesh is that your walkin over some day i'll erupt and jest eternally calcify you if you don't look out the sheriff took no stock in buck mckee's professed reformation and was greatly worried over the influence he had acquired over bud lane who had before this been slim's protege accordingly he readily conspired with her to break off the relations between the former outlaw and the young horse wrangler but thus far had met with no success payson feeling himself absolved by the death of dick lane from all obligations to his friend began openly to woo echo allen but without presuming upon the revelation of her love for him which she had made at his proposition to go into the desert to lane's rescue she responded to his courteous advances as frankly and naturally as a bud opens to the gentle wooing of the april sun softened by her grief for dick as for a departed brother as the flower is by the morning dew the petals of her affection opened and laid bare her heart of purest gold the gentle diffident girl expanded into a glorious woman conscious of her powers and proud and happy that she was fulfilling the highest function of womanhood that of loving and aiding with her love a noble man jack payson however failed to get the proper credit for this sudden flowering of echo's beauty and charm these were ascribed to her year's schooling in the east and her proud mother was offended by the way in which she accepted the young ranchman's advances you hold yourself too cheap she said it is at least due to the memory of poor dick lane whom now that he was safely dead she idealized as a type of perfect manhood that you make jack wait as long as you did him when payson reasonably objected to this delay by pointing out he was fully able to support a wife as lane had not been and proposed with echo's assent six months as the limit of waiting mrs allen resorted to her expedient tears boo hoo you are going to take away my only daughter the colonel however though he had loved dick as if he were his own son was delighted to the bottom of his hospitable soul that it was a man not already in the family circle who was to marry echo especially when he was a royal fellow like jack payson so he arranged a compromise between the time proposed by mrs allen and that desired by the lovers and the date of the wedding was fixed nine months ahead it will fall in june said the old fellow who knew exactly how to handle his fractious wife the month when swell folks back in the east do all their hitchin up why come to think of it it was the very month i ran off with you in though i didn't know then that we was elopin so strictly accordin to the book of etikwet chapter iii a woman's loyalty the first instinctive thought of a man reveals innate character those that follow the moral that he has acquired through environment and circumstances that jack payson was at bottom good man is shown by his first emotion which was joy and his first impulse which was to impart the glad news to everybody upon receiving the letter from dick lane telling that he was alive and soon to come home he was in his house at the time bud lane had just brought in the packet of mail from florence and was riding away jack uttered a cry of joy which brought the young man back to the door what is it asked bud but jack had already had time for his damning second thought he was stunned by the consideration that the promulgation of the news in the letter meant his loss of echo allen he dissembled though as yet he was not able to tell an outright falsehood it's a letter telling me that i may expect to receive enough money in a month or so to pay off the mortgage now your brother's debt needn't trouble you any longer bud whew w whistled bud that's great where does it come from oh from an old friend that i lent the money to some time ago but say bud there's another matter i want to talk with you about you've got to shake buck mckee i've got it straight that he is the worst man in arizona territory yes worse than an apache why he has been with geronimo torturing and massacring lone prospectors and robbing them of their gold that's a damned lie jack payson and you know it cried the hot headed young man it was buck mckee who stood by dick's side and fought the apaches and i'll stand by buck against all the world everybody is in a conspiracy against him polly and slim hoover and you why are you so ready now to take a slanderer's word against his you were keen enough to accept his story when it let you out of going to dick's rescue and gave you free swing to court his girl let me see the name of the damned snake in the grass that's at the bottom of all this and he snatched for the letter in payson's hand the ranchman quickly thrust the missive into pocket the injustice of bud's reflections on former actions gave to his uneasy conscience just the pretext he desired for justifying his present course his cause being weak and unworthy he whipped up his indignation by adopting a high tone and overbearing manner even demeaning himself by using his position as bud's employer to crush the younger man indeed at the end of the scene which ensued he well nigh convinced himself that he had been most ungratefully treated by bud while sincerely attempting to save the boy from the companionship of a fiend in human guise no matter who told me young man he exclaimed i got it straight and you can take it straight from me you either give up buck mckee or the sweetwater ranch snake in the grass he was working himself up into false passion it is you ungrateful boy who are sinking the serpent's tooth in the hand that would have helped you i tell you that i intended to make you foreman though sage brush charley is an older and better man it was for dick's sake i would have done it no bud burst forth for your guilty conscience's sake it would have been to pay for stepping into dick's place in the heart of a faithless girl to hell with your job i'm through with you and leaping on his horse bud rode furiously back to rejoin buck mckee in florence jack payson's purpose was now cinched to suppress dick lane's letter until echo allen was irrevocably joined to him in marriage he argued with himself that she loved him jack payson yet so loyal was she by nature that if dick lane returned before the wedding and claimed her she would sacrifice her love to her sense of duty this would ruin her life he reasoned and he could not permit it there was honesty in this argument but he vitiated it by deferring to act upon the suggestion that naturally arose with it why then not take jim allen echo's father to whom her happiness was the chief purpose in life into confidence in regard to the matter there will be time enough to tell the colonel before the wedding he thought in the meantime something might happen to dick and he may never return he is certain not to get back ahead of his money after the time that the note secured by the mortgage fell due the young ranchman had already secured two extensions of it for three months each he arranged a third and began negotiating for the sale of some of his cattle to take up the note at the time of payment i can't take the money from dick he thought even if he does owe it to me and yet if i refuse it it will be like buying echo paying for stepping into dick's place as bud expressed it what to do i don't know well events will decide and by this favorite reflection of the moral coward jack payson marked the lowest depths of his degradation that afternoon payson rode to allen hacienda to see echo and to sound her upon her feelings to dick lane he wished thoroughly to convince himself that he jack payson held complete sway over her heart perhaps he might dare to put her love to the test and fulfil the trust his friend had imposed on"
