the child was homesick she wanted her mother assuredly that explained everything the lure of sails and picnics having failed dorothea's mother came to a decision with sympathetic tears in her eyes and a glance toward her own innocent she shall take the first train home if she wants to the child sha'n't be miserable no don't urge her bob i was homesick myself once and i understand perfectly dorothea reposed in the shade of the bulkhead sand on her person and a great peace in her heart upon which the monster departing had left no scar under her head was the godey's lady's book in which over the picture of a brocaded pelisse she had recently finished a poem in which lover rhymed with forever amiel cross legged on the sand beside her was whistling gently as he industriously whittled at a bit of driftwood little suspecting that at the moment he was taking tea in a bower with lady ursula presently he drew a letter from his pocket and flipped it over to dorothea your mother asked me to give you this he said she thought it might be from that pretty little friend of yours dorothea opened the letter with some trepidation presently a bland smile over spread her countenance the day of reckoning that she expected to dawn upon her next meeting with her victim melted cloud like as she read dear dorothea i arrived home safely it's just as well i did because my aunt was waiting to take me to lake george but you made a mistake in the vision it wasn't my mother it was mrs gray across the street and hers is a boy but i think that was very near i think the vision was perfectly wonderful but i am glad i don't have them my mother says i can come again later if your mother wants me i didn't tell her why i came home because she doesn't believe in them either she presented her love to several people and added in a postscript let me know at lake george if you have another dorothea tore the letter into minute scraps and gave them over to the sea breeze well queried amiel idly what does she say she says she arrived safely said dorothea vol xxiii no 1 july 1910 pages 44 55 the gold brick and the gold mine fake mining schemes that steal the people's savings by emerson hough author of the mississippi bubble 54 40 or fight etc editor's note it is time vigorous efforts were made to stop the cruel frauds perpetrated on the name of one of the world's greatest industries mining is a legitimate and honorable enterprise it contributes immensely to the national wealth it has been the source of some of our great fortunes because there is something magical in the suggestion of gold or coal or copper taken out of the ground sharpers have made mining an instrument of successful deception they have tricked people into investing their savings in worthless or even non existent mines perhaps you who read this have bitten at an advertisement in a reputable publication which pretended to place the wealth of some western el dorado at your feet for a few hundred dollars doubtless your money has disappeared it is for the purpose of giving you the protection of a knowledge both of legitimate mining and of the ways of thieves that this article is published america is the land of the free and the country of opportunity for all incidentally it is free hunting ground for sharpers and a land of opportunity for the unscrupulous no such chances for fraudulent business exist anywhere else in the world americans are the richest people on earth and the most easily parted from their money those whose sole ambition is to get rich quick very frequently help some other man to get rich quick society owes no debt to either of these it is obliged to support them both this is wrong both as a moral and as an industrial proposition once a dollar was spent to mine a dollar to day two are spent one dollar goes into blasting powder the other into advertising and office furniture no doubt you have heard the age old legend of the mother vein of gold which appears and vanishes now and again in this corner of the world superstition regarding this great original vein of gold is found wherever men seek the precious metal the feverish spaniards called this phantom lode the madre d'oro or mother of gold now it is located in mexico now in india or peru california or australia tradition says that montezuma got his gold from this great vein which lay in a secret valley whose where abouts was jealously guarded by three priests of the war tribe sole possessors of the knowledge any intruder who by chance or design looked down into this valley was smitten absolutely blind tradition among the successors of the aztecs says that when montezuma passed the madre d'oro sank back again into the earth and has been seen no more men still follow the phantom vein those who see it even in their dreams still are smitten blind gold there is no other word that means quite so much we want gold indeed we must have it malleable divisible indestructible rare it is the indispensable medium of exchange it is our chosen unit of power and success the measure of civilization and human attainment hence it has always been the object of human desire the golden fleece very probably was the sheepskin bottom of an old time sluice box in a day when they used wool instead of blankets below the rocker troughs in the vast ruined civilization of southeast africa unknown men once mined probably 400,000,000 worth of gold there are mines profitably operated in greece to day which the phoenicians opened 1,200 b c sixteen hundred years later the romans owned all the mines in europe hannibal once paid his warriors in gold coin of carthage egypt was settled by the semitic races 2,500 b c because of the gold that was found there a thousand years later job knew about gold and five hundred years later still king solomon showed what an abundance of wives and what a reputation for wisdom a man can get when he has unlimited gold mines back of him columbus found america when he was searching for the wealth of ormus and of ind cortez and pizarro toiled and slew in the hope of finding the madre d'oro the great discoveries of the world have been made by men in search of gold the great voyages of exploration were in part piratical voyages made in search of gold already found and mined by others honest mining in hannibal's time but there is to be said about gold mining ways of the old time that tyre sought gold with actual ships with actual men and mining implements the peninsula of sinai did not sell stock but mined actual gold gold in those days meant actual risk and courage perhaps even then fraudulent promoters weren't unknown but he who ventured in the days of vespasian or hannibal or hiram too prominently to gild the gold brick certainly lost his head the mining of gold was then a sober and serious and honest matter in america we place the gold brick ahead of the gold mine we mix alloy of duplicity and greed with the virgin metal of our standard of value by improved mining methods we nearly double our output of gold and so cheapen it by well nigh a half this shrunken gold dollar is small enough but that is not all we adulterate and divide it by say another half when we falsely double its cost this we certainly do when we issue counterfeit promises as against good coin for in civilization and commerce always the genuine coinage has to pay the cost of the counterfeit your tailor charges you a stiff price for your suit of clothes that covers the clothes of the dead beats who did not pay to allow the sale of a fraudulent mining stock is to depreciate the basis of this country's values such a wrong ought not to be allowed in a country claiming an enlightened government it is the thief who is protected in america not his dupe the old law of caveat emptor protects the seller of fake mining stocks not the buyer of them there is little or no actually enforced law to protect the latter that is to say there is little or no actually enforced law to protect those who most need protection those of small incomes orphans who have no guardians wage earners who have little education widows whose life insurance is not quite enough to support them women engaged in the desperate battle of life and needing more money quick money better to protect themselves the fence between these and the natural perils of the world is slight enough in america we break it down entirely we offer these helpless ones freely as victims to the greater cunning and strength of men wholly without sense of business honor or personal decency when we do this we also attack the whole system of savings banks which is or should be the very bulwark of a nation's financial safety says the wolf to the widow to the busy professional man to the clerk the stenographer the wage earner take your money out of the savings bank what is three per cent a year when i can make you three hundred per cent a year give your money to me we permit that our national government does not undertake to put a stop to it our states do not undertake to do so and this fact is more possible through actual lack of proper statutes than through any misinterpretation or lack of enforcement of the law the field is one devised by nature for the trickster his success does not depend altogether on human gullibility part of his argument rests on the conditions which surround the industry of mining one which never can be free of extreme risk all men know that gold is found far away where living is high and means of transportation are scarce that it costs large sums to find and dig it and that such sums are more easily raised among the many than among the few none of these attending features has weight to stop the capitalization of bona fide enterprises these latter are used as bait by men who have nothing bona fide to offer and who make their fattest profits out of their shallowest shafts the sucker list in wall street methods vary among such fraudulent operators but new victims continually are found the sucker list of one firm in wall street numbers 110,000 names selected as those of persons who will bite more than once at a mining scheme and whose records show that they have so bitten this operator proudly declares that the only way a sucker can get his name off that list is to die in the reorganization of the firm of douglas lacey co of new york city it was discovered that 20,000 persons had money invested in stocks of the company the best bait in this particular operation was a trust fund established for the benefit of stockholders the proceeds of the better paying mines were to be applied to pay dividends for those which were less successful in this way the various directors of the many douglas lacey companies explained it was impossible for the investors to lose but they did lose the reorganization intended to save some of the better properties wiped out more than seventy per cent of the small stockholders widows schoolteachers stenographers washwomen scrubwomen all who once had a dollar in the stocking burr brothers inc of new york used the effective bait of the instalment plan of payment their literature and advertising offered sudden wealth at twenty cents a share payments to be in instalments the best twenty offers to be accepted it was pointed out that if one made one's weekly payment large enough to be included among the fortunate twenty one could have a nice clean certificate sent to one immediately and pay for it at one's leisure if you think the operators could not afford to do that you are ignorant there was an old negro woman in the south who often importuned her white friends for funds to build a certain somewhat mythical church they asked her what she received for the time spent in collecting i has what i gits was her frank response she enunciated a great modern mining principle which has made fortunes in denver butte new york boston and many other places where handsome lithographic work is done and where advertising space can be bought in journals considered reputable new england done by an insane man sometimes there are victims in enterprises of this sort where there probably was no deliberate intent to deceive or to defraud not long ago in boston one henry d reynolds formerly president of the reynolds alaska development company was brought before the united states circuit court on the charge of using the united states mails with intent to defraud three alienists are said to have declared him insane in 1907 ex governor john g brady of alaska endorsed reynolds and his schemes and is reported to have collected in new england about 450,000 for these reynolds projects brady gave lectures and stereopticon exhibitions in new england churches reynolds took out an excursion of boston and new england investors to prince william sound at one time and showed them the seacoast of alaska practically all of which he claimed to own at boulder bay he took his party into a long tunnel the face of which they were told was composed of solid copper ore when they emerged into the garish light of day each was given a bright copper nugget said to have come from the mine alaska reynoldsized really according to local report these nuggets of native copper had been taken from sluice boxes on chittitu creek 235 miles inland reynolds so ran the story had treated them with an acid bath to brighten them knowing that bright bait is better at any rate the good sober new englanders went back home and sent him 300,000 more which set him entirely dippy in local phrase reynolds's scheme was to run all the barber shops laundries bars and pretty much everything else on the alaskan coast a certain sam blum had a store and bank reynolds wanted it and blum it is alleged annexed 50,000 of the new england money as a forfeited first payment on his property a steamship company it was said got 75,000 of money on a forfeit so the good new england savings merrily disappeared in one of the most spectacular farces ever known in alaska which latter is too good and valid and valuable a national possession to permit to be reynoldsized as it has been reynolds in the belief of one who knew him well was a combination of the ignorant enthusiast the wild promoter and the crazy man and as for brady another alaskan called him nothing worse than an innocent old ninny yet even with so sorry a mental equipment these two took something like half a million out of conservative new england the ease with which money can be raised for such enterprises by the deliberately fraudulent or the unintentionally insane continues one of the wonders of our civilization another kind of bait offered is that of the prominent name this has proved more useful in england than in this country whittaker wright was able to secure members of the nobility for his boards of directors and the english public swallowed his schemes one after another bait hook bob and sinker in this country we have no lords whom we dearly love so the names of prominent literary or scientific men sometimes are employed by wise promoters a prominent mining expert is excellent bait some good men have been used in this way and the bait of their reputation in other lines of activity has served to make ignorant and innocent people of small means swallow the hook hid in the lying statements which they have perhaps innocently certainly ignorantly fathered we are all familiar with the literature of this class sent to us under the guise of personal and intimate confidence always that part of the communication is followed by the blackfaced type where the stinger lies concealed the words at once usually come in capitals as do last chance and price positively will advance after ten days millions and millions of dollars have been extracted from the public by these means there is no law against it adjoining mines good bait then there is the same old argument about wonderful properties adjoining such and such a dividend paying property very often the properties are miles apart they might be within twenty five feet of each other and one still might be worthless and the other rich the profits of old and famous properties very frequently are given in advertising literature of this class to show what money there is in mining the property sold may be a ten foot hole in a sand bank two thousand miles from any of these yet this absurd argument is sufficient to extract coin from the pocket of the american buyer you can use michigan to tout him on to arizona utah to land him in california mexico to interest him in alaska is it not true there is no law against it again the appeal to your mining pocket may come not through the advertising page but in the proper person of the promoter or owner himself for instance not long ago a gentleman from california came into my office he owned a mine on the old and well traced mother vein of tuolumne county california it had been well opened and showed in development according to a reputable engineer's report three million dollars worth of ore in sight with many tons of the best ore already in the dump stuff which would run very high in value at the proper time the gentleman carefully produced from his pocket a little ingot of pure gold product of one test mill run he gave the best of references as to his responsibility he offered to guarantee ten per cent dividends on all money invested and declared that he had a banking proposition and not a mine wheelbarrow vs 72,000 my christian friend said i to him you seem to have a good thing how far is it from your mine dump to the nearest bank about five miles he answered in that case said i it seems to me you don't need to sell a hundred thousand dollars worth of stock to build a stamp mill you need only enough to buy yourself a good strong wheelbarrow in two or three months you can thus build your own stamp mill and pay for it with ore and still have your mine all in your own hands he could not see it that way and pursuing his own method he took 72,000 in two weeks out of the city of chicago from some of the best business men of that city now perhaps he had a real mine i have no right to doubt that he had but the point of interest to the small investor is this neither have i any right to believe that he had the thing for me to do had i wished to invest in this way would have been to send an expert to see the property personally enter the financial agent in this game of plucking the dollars of the poor and the ignorant there has been a gradual improvement in methods the constant aim has been first to increase the amount of the harvest second to reduce to a minimum the risk the reapers run of detection and punishment by the authorities experience in most lines of commercial activity has shown that the middlemen often gather in the largest profits and have the smallest losses many of those working the mining game and by this is meant selling stocks on wind and water have made use of this fact to day in the majority of cases we have in place of the prospector or the company selling stock direct to the suckers the financial or fiscal agent he operates either under the name of a banking firm or as a security company which is generally a registered trade name intended as a cloak to cover the names of individuals not desirous of publicity the financial agent of this description is in reality the organizer and promoter of the mining company whose stock he sells but should trouble come along he is the first to assert that he has been deceived as well as his customers he sells the shares of the mine on a commission basis so large that practically nothing is left for development he takes out of the money secured large salaries and the entire expense of advertising and carrying on the exploitation he prepares all the literature one of the advantages he claims for his proposition is the wide distribution of the stock as a safeguard against assault by wicked wall street interests culled two millions in four years in this wide distribution however lies one of his own greatest safeguards against either criminal or civil prosecution scattered over the country are his investors the mill hand the poor seamstress the humble artisan whose total investments comprising perhaps all their savings seldom exceed one hundred dollars each and with their savings gone there isn't money left to pay carfare to the office of the financial agent let alone to undertake a civil suit or enlist the aid of the authorities the poor seamstress has no way of knowing any of her fellow unfortunates hence the utter impossibility of cooperation in seeking to get back their savings as an example of the fiscal agent there may be cited the concern of douglas lacey company already mentioned a concern which in four years through its operations in this country and in canada culled from the people of this country according to its own statement over 2,000,000 in exchange for stock certificates in more than forty varieties of mining companies here is a letter written to a woman by this concern four years after she had invested all her savings in the stock of one of these companies through this concern showing the advantage of the fiscal agency plan douglas lacey co financial agents 66 broadway new york cable address douglacey anglo american and bedford mcneil codes telephone 790 791 rector dear madam june 2 1908 replying to your favor of june 1st would say that we do not find in our files any recent letter from you and your letter addressed care of 44 wall street has probably gone to the dead letter office from which you will in time receive it now in reply to your question we think if you are at all familiar with business procedure you will see that it would be impossible for the fiscal agents of any of the companies to return money which had been paid for shares and which had been turned over by the fiscal agents to the treasury of the various companies and expended in development work on the different properties it is true that we have sold stock for our customers at various times and we are glad to do so when it is possible at the present time however as this company is in process of reorganization there would be no market for its stock and for this reason we are unable to help you in the way you request very truly yours douglas lacey co in pursuing this method few promoters have had the success of dr john grant lyman he is credited with having gathered in a half million dollars in his international zinc operations this company was supposed to have valuable zinc properties in the joplin district of missouri to unload its stock on the people of this country lyman organized the firm of joshua brown company bankers incorporated under the laws of west virginia through them the stock was sold until the collapse of the scheme in 1901 when the investors found that what property it did own was heavily mortgaged while the firm was taking in the money lyman maintained a racing stable had a reputation as a daring automobilist and even invaded the sacred precincts of the new york stock exchange lyman's scheme to get stocking savings three years ago the papers throughout this country were filled with the advertisements of the union securities company selling the stock of the boston greenwater copper company it was stated that the mine had cost 200,000 and that so much ore was in sight that an offer of 400,000 had been refused the union securities company with offices in new york and in goldfield nevada started the stock at forty five cents and lifted it to a dollar it was merely another name for john grant lyman not only did the union securities company sell the stock to the public but it also offered it to brokers at thirty seven and a half cents on their guarantee that it would not be sold by them at less than forty five cents the brokers began getting contracts for the stock and then were told that the union securities company was all sold out shortly thereafter confederates of lyman came to these brokers and offered stock to them at fifty cents a share and the union securities company at the same time telegraphed the brokers that it wanted all the shares it could get at sixty cents that forced the brokers to buy of confederates but when they shipped on the stock to the union securities company expecting to get sixty cents a share for it lyman was gone it had not cost him much he owed the newspapers of this country 150,000 for advertising which went unpaid he reaped 300,000 profits boston greenwater copper stock can still be found in many a stocking of humble folk salting with a cigarette it is not however always the city promoter who furnishes all of the crookedness he himself may be deceived by those who sell him the mine some of the most thrilling stories in literature might be written about salted mines the sale of the bear's nest mine and the special train expedition to the salted bear river placer field the sale of the mulatos mine to a set of chinamen and scores of other instances in american mining history have been regarded rather as big jokes than as great lessons and as to such large jesting we advance in finesse the old way of salting a placer or a quartz vein with a shotgun is now antiquated a little while ago a party of capitalists bought a nevada placer on what they thought to be strictly a cinch basis with their own hands they collected the specimen dirt from all over the claim and they watched a mexican miner pan the dirt at the creek the pans showed up beautifully they bought the claim later it proved worthless afterward they remembered that the mexican smoked cigarettes all the time he was panning and that he was careless in expectorating as well as in knocking the ashes off his cigarettes the truth was that the highly intelligent greaser was using the cigarette trick in salting the pan there was much fine gold in his cigarette and under his lip the mulatos mine salting scheme all sorts of methods of salting mines even to the injection with a hypodermic needle of strong solutions of mineral salts into a mining engineer's carefully sealed sample bags have been worked the most honest careful and expert mining engineers have been deceived time and again and salted right under their own eyes even a bland chinee may be fooled take the instance of the mulatos mine the bunch of chinamen who proposed to buy it insisted on a mill run test on fresh mined ore taken out by themselves for a five days run they were not taking any chances in their own belief the owners of the mine however so runs the story had a platform of plank arranged above the timbers at the top of the drift where the chinamen brought out their ore cars on this planking a man lay face downward where he could see each ore car that passed he had a rather hard life for five days on the sandwiches and water which he took up there with him but he managed to drop a pinch or so of nice gold dust into every car of ore that came trundling under him the mill run was an entire success from the viewpoint of the sellers although not from that of the buyers there is no working law let us repeat which actually protects the investor against this sort of thing nor which always protects even the promoter though he be honest the game is risky all the way along the line in spite of state laws against the heinous crime of salting which latter hath as yet by no means lost its savor the mail and mining thieves"
