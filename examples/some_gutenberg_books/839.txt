"1" "invitation of a friend of yours he has doubtless informed you of my intention in thus intruding on your party let me remind you that a person in my circumstances has exceedingly little to bind him and is not at all likely to tolerate much rudeness i am a very quiet man as a usual thing but my dear sir you are either going to oblige me in the little matter of which you are aware or you shall very bitterly repent that you ever admitted me to your ante chamber the president laughed aloud that is the way to speak said he you are a man who is a man you know the way to my heart and can do what you like with me will you he continued addressing geraldine will you step aside for a few minutes i shall finish first with your companion and some of the club’s formalities require to be fulfilled in private with these words he opened the door of a small closet into which he shut the colonel i believe in you he said to florizel as soon as they were alone but are you sure of your friend not so sure as i am of myself though he has more cogent reasons answered florizel but sure enough to bring him here without alarm he has had enough to cure the most tenacious man of life he was cashiered the other day for cheating at cards a good reason i daresay replied the president at least we have another in the same case and i feel sure of him have you also been in the service may i ask i have was the reply but i was too lazy i left it early what is your reason for being tired of life pursued the president the same as near as i can make out answered the prince unadulterated laziness the president started d n it said he you must have something better than that i have no more money added florizel that is also a vexation without doubt it brings my sense of idleness to an acute point the president rolled his cigar round in his mouth for some seconds directing his gaze straight into the eyes of this unusual neophyte but the prince supported his scrutiny with unabashed good temper if i had not a deal of experience said the president at last i should turn you off but i know the world and this much any way that the most frivolous excuses for a suicide are often the toughest to stand by and when i downright like a man as i do you sir i would rather strain the regulation than deny him the prince and the colonel one after the other were subjected to a long and particular interrogatory the prince alone but geraldine in the presence of the prince so that the president might observe the countenance of the one while the other was being warmly cross examined the result was satisfactory and the president after having booked a few details of each case produced a form of oath to be accepted nothing could be conceived more passive than the obedience promised or more stringent than the terms by which the juror bound himself the man who forfeited a pledge so awful could scarcely have a rag of honour or any of the consolations of religion left to him florizel signed the document but not without a shudder the colonel followed his example with an air of great depression then the president received the entry money and without more ado introduced the two friends into the smoking room of the suicide club the smoking room of the suicide club was the same height as the cabinet into which it opened but much larger and papered from top to bottom with an imitation of oak wainscot a large and cheerful fire and a number of gas jets illuminated the company the prince and his follower made the number up to eighteen most of the party were smoking and drinking champagne a feverish hilarity reigned with sudden and rather ghastly pauses is this a full meeting asked the prince middling said the president by the way he added if you have any money it is usual to offer some champagne it keeps up a good spirit and is one of my own little perquisites hammersmith said florizel i may leave the champagne to you and with that he turned away and began to go round among the guests accustomed to play the host in the highest circles he charmed and dominated all whom he approached there was something at once winning and authoritative in his address and his extraordinary coolness gave him yet another distinction in this half maniacal society as he went from one to another he kept both his eyes and ears open and soon began to gain a general idea of the people among whom he found himself as in all other places of resort one type predominated people in the prime of youth with every show of intelligence and sensibility in their appearance but with little promise of strength or the quality that makes success few were much above thirty and not a few were still in their teens they stood leaning on tables and shifting on their feet sometimes they smoked extraordinarily fast and sometimes they let their cigars go out some talked well but the conversation of others was plainly the result of nervous tension and was equally without wit or purport as each new bottle of champagne was opened there was a manifest improvement in gaiety only two were seated one in a chair in the recess of the window with his head hanging and his hands plunged deep into his trouser pockets pale visibly moist with perspiration saying never a word a very wreck of soul and body the other sat on the divan close by the chimney and attracted notice by a trenchant dissimilarity from all the rest he was probably upwards of forty but he looked fully ten years older and florizel thought he had never seen a man more naturally hideous nor one more ravaged by disease and ruinous excitements he was no more than skin and bone was partly paralysed and wore spectacles of such unusual power that his eyes appeared through the glasses greatly magnified and distorted in shape except the prince and the president he was the only person in the room who preserved the composure of ordinary life there was little decency among the members of the club some boasted of the disgraceful actions the consequences of which had reduced them to seek refuge in death and the others listened without disapproval there was a tacit understanding against moral judgments and whoever passed the club doors enjoyed already some of the immunities of the tomb they drank to each other’s memories and to those of notable suicides in the past they compared and developed their different views of death some declaring that it was no more than blackness and cessation others full of a hope that that very night they should be scaling the stars and commencing with the mighty dead to the eternal memory of baron trenck the type of suicides cried one he went out of a small cell into a smaller that he might come forth again to freedom for my part said a second i wish no more than a bandage for my eyes and cotton for my ears only they have no cotton thick enough in this world a third was for reading the mysteries of life in a future state and a fourth professed that he would never have joined the club if he had not been induced to believe in mr darwin i could not bear said this remarkable suicide to be descended from an ape altogether the prince was disappointed by the bearing and conversation of the members it does not seem to me he thought a matter for so much disturbance if a man has made up his mind to kill himself let him do it in god’s name like a gentleman this flutter and big talk is out of place in the meanwhile colonel geraldine was a prey to the blackest apprehensions the club and its rules were still a mystery and he looked round the room for some one who should be able to set his mind at rest in this survey his eye lighted on the paralytic person with the strong spectacles and seeing him so exceedingly tranquil he besought the president who was going in and out of the room under a pressure of business to present him to the gentleman on the divan the functionary explained the needlessness of all such formalities within the club but nevertheless presented mr hammersmith to mr malthus mr malthus looked at the colonel curiously and then requested him to take a seat upon his right you are a new comer he said and wish information you have come to the proper source it is two years since i first visited this charming club the colonel breathed again if mr malthus had frequented the place for two years there could be little danger for the prince in a single evening but geraldine was none the less astonished and began to suspect a mystification what cried he two years i thought but indeed i see i have been made the subject of a pleasantry by no means replied mr malthus mildly my case is peculiar i am not properly speaking a suicide at all but as it were an honorary member i rarely visit the club twice in two months my infirmity and the kindness of the president have procured me these little immunities for which besides i pay at an advanced rate even as it is my luck has been extraordinary i am afraid said the colonel that i must ask you to be more explicit you must remember that i am still most imperfectly acquainted with the rules of the club an ordinary member who comes here in search of death like yourself replied the paralytic returns every evening until fortune favours him he can even if he is penniless get board and lodging from the president very fair i believe and clean although of course not luxurious that could hardly be considering the exiguity if i may so express myself of the subscription and then the president’s company is a delicacy in itself indeed cried geraldine he had not greatly prepossessed me ah said mr malthus you do not know the man the drollest fellow what stories what cynicism he knows life to admiration and between ourselves is probably the most corrupt rogue in christendom and he also asked the colonel is a permanency like yourself if i may say so without offence indeed he is a permanency in a very different sense from me replied mr malthus i have hem graciously spared but i must go at last now he never plays he shuffles and deals for the club and makes the necessary arrangements that man my dear mr hammersmith is the very soul of ingenuity for three years he has pursued in london his useful and i think i may add his artistic calling and not so much as a whisper of suspicion has been once aroused i believe him myself to be inspired you doubtless remember the celebrated case six months ago of the gentleman who was accidentally poisoned in a chemists shop that was one of the least rich one of the least racy of his notions but then how simple and how safe you astound me said the colonel was that unfortunate gentleman one of the he was about to say victims but bethinking himself in time he substituted members of the club in the same flash of thought it occurred to him that mr malthus himself had not at all spoken in the tone of one who is in love with death and he added hurriedly but i perceive i am still in the dark you speak of shuffling and dealing pray for what end and since you seem rather unwilling to die than otherwise i must own that i cannot conceive what brings you here at all you say truly that you are in the dark replied mr malthus with more animation why my dear sir this club is the temple of intoxication if my enfeebled health could support the excitement more often you may depend upon it i should be more often here it requires all the sense of duty engendered by a long habit of ill health and careful regimen to keep me from excess in this which is i may say my last dissipation i have tried them all sir he went on laying his hand on geraldine’s arm all without exception and i declare to you upon my honour there is not one of them that has not been grossly and untruthfully overrated people trifle with love now i deny that love is a strong passion fear is the strong passion it is with fear that you must trifle if you wish to taste the intensest joys of living envy me envy me sir he added with a chuckle i am a coward geraldine could scarcely repress a movement of repulsion for this deplorable wretch but he commanded himself with an effort and continued his inquiries how sir he asked is the excitement so artfully prolonged and where is there any element of uncertainty i must tell you how the victim for every evening is selected returned mr malthus and not only the victim but another member who is to be the instrument in the club’s hands and death’s high priest for that occasion good god said the colonel do they then kill each other the trouble of suicide is removed in that way returned malthus with a nod merciful heavens ejaculated the colonel and may you may i may the my friend i mean may any of us be pitched upon this evening as the slayer of another man’s body and immortal spirit can such things be possible among men born of women oh infamy of infamies he was about to rise in his horror when he caught the prince’s eye it was fixed upon him from across the room with a frowning and angry stare and in a moment geraldine recovered his composure after all he added why not and since you say the game is interesting _vogue la galère_ i follow the club mr malthus had keenly enjoyed the colonel’s amazement and disgust he had the vanity of wickedness and it pleased him to see another man give way to a generous movement while he felt himself in his entire corruption superior to such emotions you now after your first moment of surprise said he are in a position to appreciate the delights of our society you can see how it combines the excitement of a gaming table a duel and a roman amphitheatre the pagans did well enough i cordially admire the refinement of their minds but it has been reserved for a christian country to attain this extreme this quintessence this absolute of poignancy you will understand how vapid are all amusements to a man who has acquired a taste for this one the game we play he continued is one of extreme simplicity a full pack but i perceive you are about to see the thing in progress will you lend me the help of your arm i am unfortunately paralysed indeed just as mr malthus was beginning his description another pair of folding doors was thrown open and the whole club began to pass not without some hurry into the adjoining room it was similar in every respect to the one from which it was entered but somewhat differently furnished the centre was occupied by a long green table at which the president sat shuffling a pack of cards with great particularity even with the stick and the colonel’s arm mr malthus walked with so much difficulty that every one was seated before this pair and the prince who had waited for them entered the apartment and in consequence the three took seats close together at the lower end of the board it is a pack of fifty two whispered mr malthus watch for the ace of spades which is the sign of death and the ace of clubs which designates the official of the night happy happy young men he added you have good eyes and can follow the game alas i cannot tell an ace from a deuce across the table and he proceeded to equip himself with a second pair of spectacles i must at least watch the faces he explained the colonel rapidly informed his friend of all that he had learned from the honorary member and of the horrible alternative that lay before them the prince was conscious of a deadly chill and a contraction about his heart he swallowed with difficulty and looked from side to side like a man in a maze one bold stroke whispered the colonel and we may still escape but the suggestion recalled the prince’s spirits silence said be let me see that you can play like a gentleman for any stake however serious and he looked about him once more to all appearance at his ease although his heart beat thickly and he was conscious of an unpleasant heat in his bosom the members were all very quiet and intent every one was pale but none so pale as mr malthus his eyes protruded his head kept nodding involuntarily upon his spine his hands found their way one after the other to his mouth where they made clutches at his tremulous and ashen lips it was plain that the honorary member enjoyed his membership on very startling terms attention gentlemen said the president and he began slowly dealing the cards about the table in the reverse direction pausing until each man had shown his card nearly every one hesitated and sometimes you would see a player’s fingers stumble more than once before he could turn over the momentous slip of pasteboard as the prince’s turn drew nearer he was conscious of a growing and almost suffocating excitement but he had somewhat of the gambler’s nature and recognised almost with astonishment that there was a degree of pleasure in his sensations the nine of clubs fell to his lot the three of spades was dealt to geraldine and the queen of hearts to mr malthus who was unable to suppress a sob of relief the young man of the cream tarts almost immediately afterwards turned over the ace of clubs and remained frozen with horror the card still resting on his finger he had not come there to kill but to be killed and the prince in his generous sympathy with his position almost forgot the peril that still hung over himself and his friend the deal was coming round again and still death’s card had not come out the players held their respiration and only breathed by gasps the prince received another club geraldine had a diamond but when mr malthus turned up his card a horrible noise like that of something breaking issued from his mouth and he rose from his seat and sat down again with no sign of his paralysis it was the ace of spades the honorary member had trifled once too often with his terrors conversation broke out again almost at once the players relaxed their rigid attitudes and began to rise from the table and stroll back by twos and threes into the smoking room the president stretched his arms and yawned like a man who has finished his day’s work but mr malthus sat in his place with his head in his hands and his hands upon the table drunk and motionless a thing stricken down the prince and geraldine made their escape at once in the cold night air their horror of what they had witnessed was redoubled alas cried the prince to be bound by an oath in such a matter to allow this wholesale trade in murder to be continued with profit and impunity if i but dared to forfeit my pledge that is impossible for your highness replied the colonel whose honour is the honour of bohemia but i dare and may with propriety forfeit mine geraldine said the prince if your honour suffers in any of the adventures into which you follow me not only will i never pardon you but what i believe will much more sensibly affect you i should never forgive myself i receive your highness’s commands replied the colonel shall we go from this accursed spot yes said the prince call a cab in heaven’s name and let me try to forget in slumber the memory of this night’s disgrace but it was notable that he carefully read the name of the court before he left it the next morning as soon as the prince was stirring colonel geraldine brought him a daily newspaper with the following paragraph marked melancholy accident this morning about two o’clock mr bartholomew malthus of 16 chepstow place westbourne grove on his way home from a party at a friend’s house fell over the upper parapet in trafalgar square fracturing his skull and breaking a leg and an arm death was instantaneous mr malthus accompanied by a friend was engaged in looking for a cab at the time of the unfortunate occurrence as mr malthus was paralytic it is thought that his fall may have been occasioned by another seizure the unhappy gentleman was well known in the most respectable circles and his loss will be widely and deeply deplored if ever a soul went straight to hell said geraldine solemnly it was that paralytic man’s the prince buried his face in his hands and remained silent i am almost rejoiced continued the colonel to know that he is dead but for our young man of the cream tarts i confess my heart bleeds geraldine said the prince raising his face that unhappy lad was last night as innocent as you and i and this morning the guilt of blood is on his soul when i think of the president my heart grows sick within me i do not know how it shall be done but i shall have that scoundrel at my mercy as there is a god in heaven what an experience what a lesson was that game of cards one said the colonel never to be repeated the prince remained so long without replying that geraldine grew alarmed you cannot mean to return he said you have suffered too much and seen too much horror already the duties of your high position forbid the repetition of the hazard there is much in what you say replied prince florizel and i am not altogether pleased with my own determination alas in the clothes of the greatest potentate what is there but a man i never felt my weakness more acutely than now geraldine but it is stronger than i can i cease to interest myself in the fortunes of the unhappy young man who supped with us some hours ago can i leave the president to follow his nefarious career unwatched can i begin an adventure so entrancing and not follow it to an end no geraldine you ask of the prince more than the man is able to perform to night once more we take our places at the table of the suicide club colonel geraldine fell upon his knees will your highness take my life he cried it is his his freely but do not o do not let him ask me to countenance so terrible a risk colonel geraldine replied the prince with some haughtiness of manner your life is absolutely your own i only looked for obedience and when that is unwillingly rendered i shall look for that no longer i add one word your importunity in this affair has been sufficient the master of the horse regained his feet at once your highness he said may i be excused in my attendance this afternoon i dare not as an honourable man venture a second time into that fatal house until i have perfectly ordered my affairs your highness shall meet i promise him with no more opposition from the most devoted and grateful of his servants my dear geraldine returned prince florizel i always regret when you oblige me to remember my rank dispose of your day as you think fit but be here before eleven in the same disguise the club on this second evening was not so fully attended and when geraldine and the prince arrived there were not above half a dozen persons in the smoking room his highness took the president aside and congratulated him warmly on the demise of mr malthus i like he said to meet with capacity and certainly find much of it in you your profession is of a very delicate nature but i see you are well qualified to conduct it with success and secrecy the president was somewhat affected by these compliments from one of his highness’s superior bearing he acknowledged them almost with humility poor malthy he added i shall hardly know the club without him the most of my patrons are boys sir and poetical boys who are not much company for me not but what malthy had some poetry too but it was of a kind that i could understand i can readily imagine you should find yourself in sympathy with mr malthus returned the prince he struck me as a man of a very original disposition the young man of the cream tarts was in the room but painfully depressed and silent his late companions sought in vain to lead him into conversation how bitterly i wish he cried that i had never brought you to this infamous abode begone while you are clean handed if you could have heard the old man scream as he fell and the noise of his bones upon the pavement wish me if you have any kindness to so fallen a being wish the ace of spades for me to night a few more members dropped in as the evening went on but the club did not muster more than the devil’s dozen when they took their places at the table the prince was again conscious of a certain joy in his alarms but he was astonished to see geraldine so much more self possessed than on the night before it is extraordinary thought the prince that a will made or unmade should so greatly influence a young man’s spirit attention gentlemen said the president and he began to deal three times the cards went all round the table and neither of the marked cards had yet fallen from his hand the excitement as he began the fourth distribution was overwhelming there were just cards enough to go once more entirely round the prince who sat second from the dealer’s left would receive in the reverse mode of dealing practised at the club the second last card the third player turned up a black ace it was the ace of clubs the next received a diamond the next a heart and so on but the ace of spades was still undelivered at last geraldine who sat upon the prince’s left turned his card it was an ace but the ace of hearts when prince florizel saw his fate upon the table in front of him his heart stood still he was a brave man but the sweat poured off his face there were exactly fifty chances out of a hundred that he was doomed he reversed the card it was the ace of spades a loud roaring filled his brain and the table swam before his eyes he heard the player on his right break into a fit of laughter that sounded between mirth and disappointment he saw the company rapidly dispersing but his mind was full of other thoughts he recognised how foolish how criminal had been his conduct in perfect health in the prime of his years the heir to a throne he had gambled away his future and that of a brave and loyal country god he cried god forgive me and with that the confusion of his senses passed away and he regained his self possession in a moment to his surprise geraldine had disappeared there was no one in the card room but his destined butcher consulting with the president and the young man of the cream tarts who slipped up to the prince and whispered in his ear i would give a million if i had it for your luck his highness could not help reflecting as the young man departed that he would have sold his opportunity for a much more moderate sum the whispered conference now came to an end the holder of the ace of clubs left the room with a look of intelligence and the president approaching the unfortunate prince proffered him his hand i am pleased to have met you sir said he and pleased to have been in a position to do you this trifling service at least you cannot complain of delay on the second evening what a stroke of luck the prince endeavoured in vain to articulate something in response but his mouth was dry and his tongue seemed paralysed you feel a little sickish asked the president with some show of solicitude most gentlemen do will you take a little brandy the prince signified in the affirmative and the other immediately filled some of the spirit into a tumbler poor old malthy"
