"1" "had now been more or less abandoned in favor of some later find i don't think it lived long enough to justify its name but at that time there it still was in greek street a few doors from soho square and almost opposite to that house where in the first years of the century a little girl and with her a boy named de quincey made nightly encampment in darkness and hunger among dust and rats and old legal parchments the vingtieme was but a small whitewashed room leading out into the street at one end and into a kitchen at the other the proprietor and cook was a frenchman known to us as monsieur vingtieme the waiters were his two daughters rose and berthe and the food according to faith was good the tables were so narrow and were set so close together that there was space for twelve of them six jutting from each wall only the two nearest to the door as i went in were occupied on one side sat a tall flashy rather mephistophelian man whom i had seen from time to time in the domino room and elsewhere on the other side sat soames they made a queer contrast in that sunlit room soames sitting haggard in that hat and cape which nowhere at any season had i seen him doff and this other this keenly vital man at sight of whom i more than ever wondered whether he were a diamond merchant a conjurer or the head of a private detective agency i was sure soames didn't want my company but i asked as it would have seemed brutal not to whether i might join him and took the chair opposite to his he was smoking a cigarette with an untasted salmi of something on his plate and a half empty bottle of sauterne before him and he was quite silent i said that the preparations for the jubilee made london impossible i rather liked them really i professed a wish to go right away till the whole thing was over in vain did i attune myself to his gloom he seemed not to hear me or even to see me i felt that his behavior made me ridiculous in the eyes of the other man the gangway between the two rows of tables at the vingtieme was hardly more than two feet wide rose and berthe in their ministrations had always to edge past each other quarreling in whispers as they did so and any one at the table abreast of yours was virtually at yours i thought our neighbor was amused at my failure to interest soames and so as i could not explain to him that my insistence was merely charitable i became silent without turning my head i had him well within my range of vision i hoped i looked less vulgar than he in contrast with soames i was sure he was not an englishman but what was his nationality though his jet black hair was en brosse i did not think he was french to berthe who waited on him he spoke french fluently but with a hardly native idiom and accent i gathered that this was his first visit to the vingtieme but berthe was offhand in her manner to him he had not made a good impression his eyes were handsome but like the vingtieme's tables too narrow and set too close together his nose was predatory and the points of his mustache waxed up behind his nostrils gave a fixity to his smile decidedly he was sinister and my sense of discomfort in his presence was intensified by the scarlet waistcoat which tightly and so unseasonably in june sheathed his ample chest this waistcoat wasn't wrong merely because of the heat either it was somehow all wrong in itself it wouldn't have done on christmas morning it would have struck a jarring note at the first night of hernani i was trying to account for its wrongness when soames suddenly and strangely broke silence a hundred years hence he murmured as in a trance we shall not be here i briskly but fatuously added we shall not be here no he droned but the museum will still be just where it is and the reading room just where it is and people will be able to go and read there he inhaled sharply and a spasm as of actual pain contorted his features i wondered what train of thought poor soames had been following he did not enlighten me when he said after a long pause you think i haven't minded minded what soames neglect failure failure i said heartily failure i repeated vaguely neglect yes perhaps but that's quite another matter of course you haven't been appreciated but what then any artist who who gives what i wanted to say was any artist who gives truly new and great things to the world has always to wait long for recognition but the flattery would not out in the face of his misery a misery so genuine and so unmasked my lips would not say the words and then he said them for me i flushed that's what you were going to say isn't it he asked how did you know it's what you said to me three years ago when fungoids was published i flushed the more i need not have flushed at all it's the only important thing i ever heard you say he continued and i've never forgotten it it's a true thing it's a horrible truth but d'you remember what i answered i said i don't care a sou for recognition and you believed me you've gone on believing i'm above that sort of thing you're shallow what should you know of the feelings of a man like me you imagine that a great artist's faith in himself and in the verdict of posterity is enough to keep him happy you've never guessed at the bitterness and loneliness the his voice broke but presently he resumed speaking with a force that i had never known in him posterity what use is it to me a dead man doesn't know that people are visiting his grave visiting his birthplace putting up tablets to him unveiling statues of him a dead man can't read the books that are written about him a hundred years hence think of it if i could come back to life then just for a few hours and go to the reading room and read or better still if i could be projected now at this moment into that future into that reading room just for this one afternoon i'd sell myself body and soul to the devil for that think of the pages and pages in the catalogue soames enoch endlessly endless editions commentaries prolegomena biographies but here he was interrupted by a sudden loud crack of the chair at the next table our neighbor had half risen from his place he was leaning toward us apologetically intrusive excuse permit me he said softly i have been unable not to hear might i take a liberty in this little restaurant sans facon might i as the phrase is cut in i could but signify our acquiescence berthe had appeared at the kitchen door thinking the stranger wanted his bill he waved her away with his cigar and in another moment had seated himself beside me commanding a full view of soames though not an englishman he explained i know my london well mr soames your name and fame mr beerbohm's too very known to me your point is who am _i_ he glanced quickly over his shoulder and in a lowered voice said i am the devil i couldn't help it i laughed i tried not to i knew there was nothing to laugh at my rudeness shamed me but i laughed with increasing volume the devil's quiet dignity the surprise and disgust of his raised eyebrows did but the more dissolve me i rocked to and fro i lay back aching i behaved deplorably i am a gentleman and he said with intense emphasis i thought i was in the company of gentlemen don't i gasped faintly oh don't curious nicht wahr i heard him say to soames there is a type of person to whom the very mention of my name is oh so awfully funny in your theaters the dullest comedien needs only to say the devil and right away they give him the loud laugh what speaks the vacant mind is it not so i had now just breath enough to offer my apologies he accepted them but coldly and re addressed himself to soames i am a man of business he said and always i would put things through right now as they say in the states you are a poet les affaires you detest them so be it but with me you will deal eh what you have said just now gives me furiously to hope soames had not moved except to light a fresh cigarette he sat crouched forward with his elbows squared on the table and his head just above the level of his hands staring up at the devil go on he nodded i had no remnant of laughter in me now it will be the more pleasant our little deal the devil went on because you are i mistake not a diabolist a catholic diabolist said soames the devil accepted the reservation genially you wish he resumed to visit now this afternoon as ever is the reading room of the british museum yes but of a hundred years hence yes parfaitement time an illusion past and future they are as ever present as the present or at any rate only what you call just round the corner i switch you on to any date i project you pouf you wish to be in the reading room just as it will be on the afternoon of june 3 1997 you wish to find yourself standing in that room just past the swing doors this very minute yes and to stay there till closing time am i right soames nodded the devil looked at his watch ten past two he said closing time in summer same then as now seven o'clock that will give you almost five hours at seven o'clock pouf you find yourself again here sitting at this table i am dining to night dans le monde dans le higlif that concludes my present visit to your great city i come and fetch you here mr soames on my way home home i echoed be it never so humble said the devil lightly all right said soames soames i entreated but my friend moved not a muscle the devil had made as though to stretch forth his hand across the table but he paused in his gesture a hundred years hence as now he smiled no smoking allowed in the reading room you would better therefore soames removed the cigarette from his mouth and dropped it into his glass of sauterne soames again i cried can't you but the devil had now stretched forth his hand across the table he brought it slowly down on the table cloth soames's chair was empty his cigarette floated sodden in his wine glass there was no other trace of him for a few moments the devil let his hand rest where it lay gazing at me out of the corners of his eyes vulgarly triumphant a shudder shook me with an effort i controlled myself and rose from my chair very clever i said condescendingly but the time machine is a delightful book don't you think so entirely original you are pleased to sneer said the devil who had also risen but it is one thing to write about an impossible machine it is a quite other thing to be a supernatural power all the same i had scored berthe had come forth at the sound of our rising i explained to her that mr soames had been called away and that both he and i would be dining here it was not until i was out in the open air that i began to feel giddy i have but the haziest recollection of what i did where i wandered in the glaring sunshine of that endless afternoon i remember the sound of carpenters hammers all along piccadilly and the bare chaotic look of the half erected stands was it in the green park or in kensington gardens or where was it that i sat on a chair beneath a tree trying to read an evening paper there was a phrase in the leading article that went on repeating itself in my fagged mind little is hidden from this august lady full of the garnered wisdom of sixty years of sovereignty i remember wildly conceiving a letter to reach windsor by an express messenger told to await answer madam well knowing that your majesty is full of the garnered wisdom of sixty years of sovereignty i venture to ask your advice in the following delicate matter mr enoch soames whose poems you may or may not know was there no way of helping him saving him a bargain was a bargain and i was the last man to aid or abet any one in wriggling out of a reasonable obligation i wouldn't have lifted a little finger to save faust but poor soames doomed to pay without respite an eternal price for nothing but a fruitless search and a bitter disillusioning odd and uncanny it seemed to me that he soames in the flesh in the waterproof cape was at this moment living in the last decade of the next century poring over books not yet written and seeing and seen by men not yet born uncannier and odder still that to night and evermore he would be in hell assuredly truth was stranger than fiction endless that afternoon was almost i wished i had gone with soames not indeed to stay in the reading room but to sally forth for a brisk sight seeing walk around a new london i wandered restlessly out of the park i had sat in vainly i tried to imagine myself an ardent tourist from the eighteenth century intolerable was the strain of the slow passing and empty minutes long before seven o'clock i was back at the vingtieme i sat there just where i had sat for luncheon air came in listlessly through the open door behind me now and again rose or berthe appeared for a moment i had told them i would not order any dinner till mr soames came a hurdy gurdy began to play abruptly drowning the noise of a quarrel between some frenchmen farther up the street whenever the tune was changed i heard the quarrel still raging i had bought another evening paper on my way i unfolded it my eyes gazed ever away from it to the clock over the kitchen door five minutes now to the hour i remembered that clocks in restaurants are kept five minutes fast i concentrated my eyes on the paper i vowed i would not look away from it again i held it upright at its full width close to my face so that i had no view of anything but it rather a tremulous sheet only because of the draft i told myself my arms gradually became stiff they ached but i could not drop them now i had a suspicion i had a certainty well what then what else had i come for yet i held tight that barrier of newspaper only the sound of berthe's brisk footstep from the kitchen enabled me forced me to drop it and to utter what shall we have to eat soames il est souffrant ce pauvre monsieur soames asked berthe he's only tired i asked her to get some wine burgundy and whatever food might be ready soames sat crouched forward against the table exactly as when last i had seen him it was as though he had never moved he who had moved so unimaginably far once or twice in the afternoon it had for an instant occurred to me that perhaps his journey was not to be fruitless that perhaps we had all been wrong in our estimate of the works of enoch soames that we had been horribly right was horribly clear from the look of him but don't be discouraged i falteringly said perhaps it's only that you didn't leave enough time two three centuries hence perhaps yes his voice came i've thought of that and now now for the more immediate future where are you going to hide how would it be if you caught the paris express from charing cross almost an hour to spare don't go on to paris stop at calais live in calais he'd never think of looking for you in calais it's like my luck he said to spend my last hours on earth with an ass but i was not offended and a treacherous ass he strangely added tossing across to me a crumpled bit of paper which he had been holding in his hand i glanced at the writing on it some sort of gibberish apparently i laid it impatiently aside come soames pull yourself together this isn't a mere matter of life or death it's a question of eternal torment mind you you don't mean to say you're going to wait limply here till the devil comes to fetch you i can't do anything else i've no choice come this is trusting and encouraging with a vengeance this is diabolism run mad i filled his glass with wine surely now that you've seen the brute it's no good abusing him you must admit there's nothing miltonic about him soames i don't say he's not rather different from what i expected he's a vulgarian he's a swell mobs man he's the sort of man who hangs about the corridors of trains going to the riviera and steals ladies jewel cases imagine eternal torment presided over by him you don't suppose i look forward to it do you then why not slip quietly out of the way again and again i filled his glass and always mechanically he emptied it but the wine kindled no spark of enterprise in him he did not eat and i myself ate hardly at all i did not in my heart believe that any dash for freedom could save him the chase would be swift the capture certain but better anything than this passive meek miserable waiting i told soames that for the honor of the human race he ought to make some show of resistance he asked what the human race had ever done for him besides he said can't you understand that i'm in his power you saw him touch me didn't you there's an end of it i've no will i'm sealed i made a gesture of despair he went on repeating the word sealed i began to realize that the wine had clouded his brain no wonder foodless he had gone into futurity foodless he still was i urged him to eat at any rate some bread it was maddening to think that he who had so much to tell might tell nothing how was it all i asked yonder come tell me your adventures they'd make first rate copy wouldn't they i'm awfully sorry for you soames and i make all possible allowances but what earthly right have you to insinuate that i should make copy as you call it out of you the poor fellow pressed his hands to his forehead i don't know he said i had some reason i know i'll try to remember he sat plunged in thought that's right try to remember everything eat a little more bread what did the reading room look like much as usual he at length muttered many people there usual sort of number what did they look like soames tried to visualize them they all he presently remembered looked very like one another my mind took a fearsome leap all dressed in sanitary woolen yes i think so grayish yellowish stuff a sort of uniform he nodded with a number on it perhaps a number on a large disk of metal strapped round the left arm d k f 78,910 that sort of thing it was even so and all of them men and women alike looking very well cared for very utopian and smelling rather strongly of carbolic and all of them quite hairless i was right every time soames was only not sure whether the men and women were hairless or shorn i hadn't time to look at them very closely he explained no of course not but they stared at me i can tell you i attracted a great deal of attention at last he had done that i think i rather scared them they moved away whenever i came near they followed me about at a distance wherever i went the men at the round desk in the middle seemed to have a sort of panic whenever i went to make inquiries what did you do when you arrived well he had gone straight to the catalogue of course to the s volumes and had stood long before sn sof unable to take this volume out of the shelf because his heart was beating so at first he said he wasn't disappointed he only thought there was some new arrangement he went to the middle desk and asked where the catalogue of twentieth century books was kept he gathered that there was still only one catalogue again he looked up his name stared at the three little pasted slips he had known so well then he went and sat down for a long time and then he droned i looked up the dictionary of national biography and some encyclopedias i went back to the middle desk and asked what was the best modern book on late nineteenth century literature they told me mr t k nupton's book was considered the best i looked it up in the catalogue and filled in a form for it it was brought to me my name wasn't in the index but yes he said with a sudden change of tone that's what i'd forgotten where's that bit of paper give it me back i too had forgotten that cryptic screed i found it fallen on the floor and handed it to him he smoothed it out nodding and smiling at me disagreeably i found myself glancing through nupton's book he resumed not very easy reading some sort of phonetic spelling all the modern books i saw were phonetic then i don't want to hear any more soames please the proper names seemed all to be spelt in the old way but for that i mightn't have noticed my own name your own name really soames i'm very glad and yours no i thought i should find you waiting here to night so i took the trouble to copy out the passage read it i snatched the paper soames's handwriting was characteristically dim it and the noisome spelling and my excitement made me all the slower to grasp what t k nupton was driving at the document lies before me at this moment strange that the words i here copy out for you were copied out for me by poor soames just eighty two years hence from page 234 of inglish littracher 1890 1900 bi t k nupton publishd bi th stait 1992 fr egzarmpl a riter ov th time naimed max beerbohm hoo woz stil alive in th twentith senchri rote a stauri in wich e pautraid an

levvl an hav lernt ter doo their duti without thort ov th morro th laibrer iz werthi ov hiz hire an that iz aul thank hevvn we hav no enoch soameses amung us to dai i found that by murmuring the words aloud a device which i commend to my reader i was able to master them little by little the clearer they became the greater was my bewilderment my distress and horror the whole thing was a nightmare afar the great grisly background of what was in store for the poor dear art of letters here at the table fixing on me a gaze that made me hot all over the poor fellow whom whom evidently but no whatever down grade my character might take in coming years i should never be such a brute as to again i examined the screed immajnari but here soames was no more imaginary alas than i and labud what on earth was that to this day i have never made out that word it's all very baffling i at length stammered soames said nothing but cruelly did not cease to look at me are you sure i temporized quite sure you copied the thing out correctly quite well then it's this wretched nupton who must have made must be going to make some idiotic mistake look here soames you know me better than to suppose that i after all the name max beerbohm is not at all an uncommon one and there must be several enoch soameses running around or rather enoch soames is a name that might occur to any one writing a story and i don't write stories i'm an essayist an observer a recorder i admit that it's an extraordinary coincidence but you must see i see the whole thing said soames quietly and he added with a touch of his old manner but with more dignity than i had ever known in him parlons d'autre chose i accepted that suggestion very promptly i returned straight to the more immediate future i spent most of the long evening in renewed appeals to soames to come away and seek refuge somewhere i remember saying at last that if indeed i was destined to write about him the supposed stauri had better have at least a happy ending soames repeated those last three words in a tone of intense scorn in life and in art he said all that matters is an inevitable ending but i urged more hopefully than i felt an ending that can be avoided isn't inevitable you aren't an artist he rasped and you're so hopelessly not an artist that so far from being able to imagine a thing and make it seem true you're going to make even a true thing seem as if you'd made it up you're a miserable bungler and it's like my luck i protested that the miserable bungler was not i was not going to be i but t k nupton and we had a rather heated argument in the thick of which it suddenly seemed to me that soames saw he was in the wrong he had quite physically cowered but i wondered why and now i guessed with a cold throb just why he stared so past me the bringer of that inevitable ending filled the doorway i managed to turn in my chair and to say not without a semblance of lightness aha come in dread was indeed rather blunted in me by his looking so absurdly like a villain in a melodrama the sheen of his tilted hat and of his shirt front the repeated twists he was giving to his mustache and most of all the magnificence of his sneer gave token that he was there only to be foiled he was at our table in a stride i am sorry he sneered witheringly to break up your pleasant party but you don't you complete it i assured him mr soames and i want to have a little talk with you won't you sit mr soames got nothing frankly nothing by his journey this afternoon we don't wish to say that the whole thing was a swindle a common swindle on the contrary we believe you meant well but of course the bargain such as it was is off the devil gave no verbal answer he merely looked at soames and pointed with rigid forefinger to the door soames was wretchedly rising from his chair when with a desperate quick gesture i swept together two dinner knives that were on the table and laid their blades across each other the devil stepped sharp back against the table behind him averting his face and shuddering you are not superstitious he hissed not at all i smiled soames he said as to an underling but without turning his face put those knives straight with an inhibitive gesture to my friend mr soames i said emphatically to the devil is a catholic diabolist but my poor friend did the devil's bidding not mine and now with his master's eyes again fixed on him he arose he shuffled past me i tried to speak it was he that spoke try was the prayer he threw back at me as the devil pushed him roughly out through the door try to make them know that i did exist in another instant i too was through that door i stood staring all ways up the street across it down it there was moonlight and lamplight but there was not"
