"1" "are bad people i am quite sure and since wul takim is the king of thieves he must be by far the worst man on this island then he saw through the bars of the gate that a great cavern lay beyond in which were stacked treasures of all sorts rich cloths golden dishes and ornaments gemmed coronets and bracelets cleverly forged armor shields and battle axes also there were casks and bales of merchandise of every sort the gate appeared to have no lock so prince marvel opened it and walked in then he perceived perched on the very top of a pyramid of casks the form of a boy who sat very still and watched him with a look of astonishment upon his face what are you doing up there asked the prince nothing said the boy if i moved the least little bit this pile of casks would topple over and i should be thrown to the ground well returned the prince what of it but just then he glanced at the ground and saw why the boy did not care to tumble down for in the earth were planted many swords with their sharp blades pointing upward and to fall upon these meant serious wounds and perhaps death oh ho cried marvel i begin to understand you are a prisoner yes as you will also be shortly answered the boy and then you will understand another thing that you were very reckless ever to enter this cave why inquired the prince who really knew little of the world and was interested in everything he saw and heard because it is the stronghold of the robber king and when you opened that gate you caused a bell to ring far down on the hillside so the robbers are now warned that an enemy is in their cave and they will soon arrive to make you a prisoner even as i am ah i see said the prince with a laugh it is a rather clever contrivance but having been warned in time i should indeed be foolish to be caught in such a trap with this he half drew his sword but thinking that robbers were not worthy to be slain with its untarnished steel he pushed it back into the jeweled scabbard and looked around for another weapon a stout oaken staff lay upon the ground and this he caught up and ran with it from the cave placing himself just beside the narrow opening that led into this rock encompassed plain for he quickly saw that this was the only way any one could enter or leave the place and therefore knew the robbers were coming up the narrow gorge even as he had himself done soon they were heard stumbling along at a rapid pace crying to one another to make haste and catch the intruder the first that came through the opening received so sharp a blow upon the head from prince marvel's oak staff that he fell to the ground and lay still while the next was treated in a like manner and fell beside his comrade perhaps the thieves had not expected so sturdy an enemy for they continued to rush through the opening in the rocks and to fall beneath the steady blows of the prince's staff until every one of them lay senseless before the victor at first they had piled themselves upon one another very neatly but the pile got so high at last that the prince was obliged to assist the last thieves to leap to the top of the heap before they completely lost their senses i have no doubt our prince feeling himself yet strange in the new form he had acquired and freshly transported from the forest glades in which he had always lived was fully as much astonished at his deed of valor as were the robbers themselves and if he shuddered a little when looking upon the heap of senseless thieves you must forgive him this weakness for he straightway resolved to steel his heart to such sights and to be every bit as stern and severe as a mortal knight would have been throwing down his staff he ran to the cave again and stepping between the sword points he approached the pile of casks and held out his arms to the boy who was perched upon the top the thieves are conquered he cried jump down i won't said the boy why not inquired the prince can't you see i'm very miserable asked the boy in return don't you understand that every minute i expect to fall upon those sword points but i will catch you cried the prince i don't want you to catch me said the boy i want to be miserable it's the first chance i've ever had and i'm enjoying my misery very much this speech so astonished prince marvel that for a moment he stood motionless then he retorted angrily you're a fool if i wasn't so miserable up here i'd come down and thrash you for that said the boy with a sigh this answer so greatly annoyed prince marvel that he gave the central cask of the pyramid a sudden push and the next moment the casks were tumbling in every direction while the boy fell headlong in their midst but marvel caught him deftly in his arms and so saved him from the sword points there he said standing the boy upon his feet now you are released from your misery and i should be glad to punish you for your interference declared the boy gloomily eying his preserver had you not saved my life by catching me according to the code of honor of knighthood i can not harm one who has saved my life until i have returned the obligation therefore for the present i shall pardon your insulting speeches and actions but you have also saved my life answered prince marvel for had you not warned me of the robbers return they would surely have caught me true said the boy brightening up therefore our score is now even but take care not to affront me again for hereafter i will show you no mercy prince marvel looked at the boy with wonder he was about his own size yet strong and well formed and he would have been handsome except for the expression of discontent upon his face yet his manner and words were so absurd and unnatural that the prince was more amused than angered by his new acquaintance and presently laughed in his face if all the people in this island are like you he said i shall have lots of fun with them and you are only a boy after all i'm bigger than you declared the other glaring fiercely at the prince how much bigger asked marvel his eyes twinkling oh ever so much then fetch along that coil of rope and follow me said prince marvel fetch the rope yourself retorted the boy bluntly i'm not your servant then he put his hands in his pockets and coolly walked out of the cave to look at the pile of senseless robbers prince marvel made no reply but taking the coil of rope on his shoulder he carried it to where the thieves lay and threw it down beside them then he cut lengths from the coil with his sword and bound the limbs of each robber securely within a half hour he had laid out a row of thieves extending half way across the grassy plain and on counting their number he found he had captured fifty nine of them this task being accomplished and the robbers rendered helpless prince marvel turned to the boy who stood watching him get a suit of armor from the cave and a strong sword and then return here he said in a stern voice why should i do that asked the boy rather impudently because i am going to fight you for disobeying my orders and if you do not protect yourself i shall probably kill you that sounds pleasant said the boy but if you should prove my superior in skill i beg you will not kill me at once but let me die a lingering death why asked the prince because i shall suffer more and that will be delightful i am not anxious to kill you nor to make you suffer said marvel all that i ask is that you acknowledge me your master i won't answered the boy i acknowledge no master in all the world then you must fight declared the prince gravely if you win i will promise to serve you faithfully and if i conquer you then you must acknowledge me your master and obey my commands agreed cried the boy with sudden energy and he rushed into the cave and soon returned clad in armor and bearing a sword and shield on the shield was pictured a bolt of lightning lightning will soon strike those three girls whose champion you seem to be he said tauntingly the three girls defy your lightning returned the prince with a smile i see you are brave enough brave why should i not be answered the boy proudly i am the lord nerle the son of neggar the chief baron of heg the other bowed low i am pleased to know your station he said i am called prince marvel and this is my first adventure and likely to be your last exclaimed the boy sneeringly for i am stronger than you and i have fought many times with full grown men are you ready asked prince marvel for answer yes then the swords clashed and sparks flew from the blades but it was not for long suddenly nerle's sword went flying through the air and shattered its blade against a wall of rock he scowled at prince marvel a moment who smiled back at him then the boy rushed into the cave and returned with another sword scarcely had the weapons crossed again when with a sudden blow prince marvel snapped nerle's blade in two and followed this up with a sharp slap upon his ear with the flat of his own sword that fairly bewildered the boy and made him sit down on the grass to think what had happened to him then prince marvel's merry laugh rang far across the hills and so delighted was he at the astonished expression upon nerle's face that it was many minutes before he could control his merriment and ask his foeman if he had had enough fight i suppose i have replied the boy rubbing his ear tenderly that blow stings most deliciously but it is a hard thought that the son of baron neggar should serve prince marvel do not worry about that said the prince for i assure you my rank is so far above your own that it is no degradation for the son of neggar to serve me but come we must dispose of these thieves what is the proper fate for such men they are always hanged answered nerle getting upon his feet well there are trees handy remarked the prince although his girlish heart insisted on making him shiver in spite of his resolve to be manly and stern let us get to work and hang them as soon as possible and then we can proceed upon our journey nerle now willingly lent his assistance to his new master and soon they had placed a rope around the neck of each thief and were ready to dangle them all from the limbs of the trees but at this juncture the thieves began to regain consciousness and now wul takim the big red bearded king of the thieves sat up and asked who is our conqueror prince marvel answered nerle and what army assisted him inquired wul takim curiously gazing upon the prince he conquered you alone and single handed said nerle hearing this the big king began to weep bitterly and the tear drops ran down his face in such a stream that prince marvel ordered nerle to wipe them away with his handkerchief as the thief's hands were tied behind his back to think sobbed wul takim miserably only to think that after all my terrible deeds and untold wickedness i have been captured by a mere boy oh boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo it is a terrible disgrace you will not have to bear it long said the prince soothingly i am going to hang you in a few minutes thanks thank you very much answered the king ceasing to weep i have always expected to be hanged some day and i am glad no one but you two boys will witness me when my feet begin kicking about i shall not kick declared another of the thieves who had also regained his senses i shall sing while i am being hanged but you can not my good gunder protested the king for the rope will cut off your breath and no man can sing without breath then i shall whistle said gunder composedly the king cast at him a look of reproach and turning to prince marvel he said it will be a great task to string up so many thieves you look tired permit me to assist you to hang the others and then i will climb into a tree and hang myself from a strong branch with as little bother as possible oh i won't think of troubling you exclaimed marvel with a laugh having conquered you alone i feel it my duty to hang you without assistance save that of my esquire it's no trouble i assure you but suit your own convenience said the thief carelessly then he cast his eye toward the cave and asked what will you do with all our treasure give it to the poor said prince marvel promptly what poor oh the poorest people i can find will you permit me to advise you in this matter asked the king of thieves politely yes indeed for i am a stranger in this land returned the prince well i know a lot of people who are so poor that they have no possessions whatever neither food to eat houses to live in nor any clothing but that which covers their bodies they can call no man friend nor will any lift a hand to help them indeed good sir i verily believe they will soon perish miserably unless you come to their assistance poor creatures exclaimed prince marvel with ready sympathy tell me who they are and i will divide amongst them all your ill gotten gains they are ourselves replied the king of thieves with a sigh marvel looked at him in amazement and then burst into joyous laughter yourselves he cried greatly amused indeed yes said wul takim sadly there are no poorer people in all the world for we have ropes about our necks and are soon to be hanged to morrow we shall not have even our flesh left for the crows will pick our bones that is true remarked marvel thoughtfully but if i restore to you the treasure how will it benefit you since you are about to die must you really hang us asked the thief yes i have decreed it and you deserve your fate why because you have wickedly taken from helpless people their property and committed many other crimes besides but i have reformed we have all reformed have we not brothers we have answered the other thieves who having regained their senses were listening to this conversation with much interest and if you will return to us our treasure we will promise never to steal again but to remain honest men and enjoy our wealth in peace promised the king honest men could not enjoy treasures they have stolen said prince marvel true but this treasure is now yours having been won by you in fair battle and if you present it to us it will no longer be stolen treasure but a generous gift from a mighty prince which we may enjoy with clear consciences yet there remains the fact that i have promised to hang you suggested prince marvel with a smile for the king amused him greatly not at all not at all cried wul takim you promised to hang fifty nine thieves and there is no doubt the fifty nine thieves deserved to be hung but consider we have all reformed our ways and become honest men so it would be a sad and unkindly act to hang fifty nine honest men what think you nerle asked the prince turning to his esquire why the rogue seems to speak truth said nerle scratching his head with a puzzled air yet if he speaks truth there is little difference between a rogue and an honest man ask him my master what caused them all to reform so suddenly because we were about to die and we thought it a good way to save our lives replied the robber king that's an honest answer anyway said nerle perhaps sir they have really reformed and if so i will not have the death of fifty nine honest men on my conscience declared the prince then he turned to wul takim and added i will release you and give you the treasure as you request but you owe me allegiance from this time forth and if i ever hear of your becoming thieves again i promise to return and hang every one of you never fear answered wul takim joyfully it is hard work to steal and while we have so much treasure it is wholly unnecessary moreover having accepted from you our lives and our fortunes we shall hereafter be your devoted servants and whenever you need our services you have but to call upon us and we will support you loyally and gladly i accept your service answered the prince graciously and then he unbound the fifty nine honest men and took the ropes from their necks as nightfall was fast approaching the new servants set to work to prepare a great feast in honor of their master it was laid in the middle of the grassy clearing that all might sit around and celebrate the joyous occasion do you think you can trust these men asked nerle suspiciously why not replied the prince they have been exceedingly wicked it is true but they are now intent upon being exceedingly good let us encourage them in this if we mistrusted all who have ever done an evil act there would be fewer honest people in the world and if it were as interesting to do a good act as an evil one there is no doubt every one would choose the good 6 the troubles of nerle that night prince marvel slept within the cave surrounded by the fifty nine reformed thieves and suffered no harm at their hands in the morning accompanied by his esquire nerle who was mounted upon a spirited horse brought him by wul takim he charged the honest men to remember their promises bade them good by and set out in search of further adventure as they left the clearing by the narrow passage that led between the overhanging rocks the prince looked back and saw that the sign above the gate of the cave which had told of the thieves treasure house had been changed it now read as follows wul takim king of honest men his pleasure house walk in that is much better laughed the prince i accomplished some good by my adventure anyway nerle did not reply he seemed especially quiet and thoughtful as he rode by his master's side and after they had traveled some distance in silence prince marvel said tell me how you came to be in the cave of thieves and perched upon the casks where i found you it is a sad story returned nerle with a sigh but since you request me to tell it the tale may serve to relieve the tedium of your journey my father is a mighty baron very wealthy and with a heart so kind that he has ever taken pleasure in thrusting on me whatever gift he could think of i had not a single desire unsatisfied for before i could wish for anything it was given me my mother was much like my father she and her women were always making jams jellies candies cakes and the like for me to eat so i never knew the pleasure of hunger my clothes were the gayest satins and velvets richly made and sewn with gold and silver braid so it was impossible to wish for more in the way of apparel they let me study my lessons whenever i felt like it and go fishing or hunting as i pleased so i could not complain that i was unable to do just as i wanted to all the servants obeyed my slightest wish if i wanted to sit up late at night no one objected if i wished to lie in bed till noon they kept the house quiet so as not to disturb me this condition of affairs as you may imagine grew more and more tedious and exasperating the older i became try as i might i could find nothing to complain of i once saw the son of one of our servants receive a flogging and my heart grew light i immediately begged my father to flog me by way of variety and he who could refuse me nothing at once consented for this reason there was less satisfaction in the operation than i had expected although for the time being it was a distinct novelty now no one could expect a high spirited boy to put up with such a life as mine with nothing to desire and no chance of doing anything that would annoy my parents my days were dreary indeed he paused to wipe the tears from his eyes and the prince murmured sympathetically poor boy poor boy ah you may well say that continued nerle but one day a stranger came to my father's castle with tales of many troubles he had met with he had been lost in a forest and nearly starved to death he had been robbed and beaten and left wounded and sore by the wayside he had begged from door to door and been refused food or assistance in short his story was so delightful that it made me envy him and i yearned to suffer as he had done when i could speak with him alone i said pray tell me how i can manage to acquire the misfortunes you have undergone here i have everything that i desire and it makes me very unhappy the stranger laughed at me at first and i found some pleasure in the humiliation i then felt but it did not last long for presently he grew sober and advised me to run away from home and seek adventure once away from your father's castle said he troubles will fall upon you thick enough to satisfy even your longings that is what i am afraid of i answered i don't want to be satisfied even with troubles what i seek is unsatisfied longings nevertheless said he i advise you to travel everything will probably go wrong with you and then you will be happy i acted upon the stranger's advice and ran away from home the next day after journeying a long time i commenced to feel the pangs of hunger and was just beginning to enjoy myself when a knight rode by and gave me a supply of food at this rebuff i could not restrain my tears but while i wept my horse stumbled and threw me over his head i hoped at first i had broken my neck and was just congratulating myself upon the misfortune when a witch woman came along and rubbed some ointment upon my bruises in spite of my protests to my great grief the pain left me and i was soon well again but as a slight compensation for my disappointment my horse had run away so i began my journey anew and on foot that afternoon i stepped into a nest of wasps but the thoughtless creatures flew away without stinging me then i met a fierce tiger and my heart grew light and gay surely this will cause me suffering i cried and advanced swiftly upon the brute but the cowardly tiger turned tail and ran to hide in the bushes leaving me unhurt of course my many disappointments were some consolation but not much that night i slept on the bare ground and hoped i should catch a severe cold but no such joy was to be mine yet the next afternoon i experienced my first pleasure the thieves caught me stripped off all my fine clothes and jewels and beat me well then they carried me to their cave dressed me in rags and perched me on the top of the casks where the slightest movement on my part would send me tumbling among the sword points this was really delightful and i was quite happy until you came and released me i thought then that i might gain some pleasure by provoking you to anger and our fight was the result that blow on the ear was exquisite and by forcing me to become your servant you have made me for the first time in my life almost contented for i hope in your company to experience a great many griefs and disappointments as nerle concluded his story prince marvel turned to him and grasped his hand accept my sympathy said he i know exactly how you feel for my own life during the past few centuries has not been much different the past few centuries gasped nerle what do you mean at this the prince blushed seeing he had nearly disclosed his secret but he said quickly does it not seem centuries when one is unhappy it does indeed responded nerle earnestly but please tell me your story not now said prince marvel with a smile it will please you to desire in vain to hear a tale i will not tell yet i promise that on the day we part company i shall inform you who i am 7 the gray men the adventurers gave no heed to the path they followed after leaving the cave of the reformed thieves but their horses accidentally took the direction of the foot hills that led into the wild interior kingdom of spor therefore the travelers when they had finished their conversation and begun to look about them found themselves in a rugged mountainous country that was wholly unlike the green plains of heg they had left behind now as i have before said the most curious and fearful of the island people dwelt in this kingdom of spor they held no friendly communication with their neighbors and only left their own mountains to plunder and rob and so sullen and fierce were they on these occasions that every one took good care to keep out of their way until they had gone back home again there was much gossip about the unknown king of spor who had never yet been seen by any one except his subjects and some thought he must be one of the huge giants of spor and others claimed he was a dwarf like his tiny but ferocious dart slingers and still others imagined him one of the barbarian tribe or a fellow to the terrible gray men but of course no one knew positively and all these guesses were very wide of the mark the only certainty about this king was that his giants dwarfs barbarians and gray men meekly acknowledged his rule and obeyed his slightest wish for though they might be terrible to others their king was still more terrible to them into this kingdom of spor prince marvel and nerle had now penetrated and neither knowing nor caring where they were continued along the faintly defined paths the horses had found presently however they were startled by a peal of shrill elfish laughter and raising their eyes they beheld a horrid looking old man seated upon a high rock near by why do you laugh asked prince marvel stopping his horse have you been invited tell me have you been invited demanded the old man chuckling to himself as if much amused invited where inquired the prince to spor stupid to the kingdom of spor to the land of king terribus shrieked the old man going into violent peals of laughter we go and come as we please answered prince marvel calmly go yes go if you will but you'll never come back never never never the little old man seemed to consider this such a good joke that he bent nearly double with laughing and so lost his balance and toppled off the rock disappearing from their view but they could hear him laugh long after they had passed on and left him far behind them a strange creature exclaimed the prince thoughtfully but perhaps he speaks truth answered nerle if in fact we have been rash enough to enter the kingdom of spor even my father the bravest baron in heg has never dared venture within the borders of spor for all men fear its mysterious king in that case replied prince marvel it is time some one investigated this strange kingdom people have left king terribus and his wild subjects too much to themselves instead of stirring"
