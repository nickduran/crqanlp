"1" "there was no remedy so having smoothed my hair as well as i could and repeatedly twitched my obdurate collar i proceeded to clomp down the two flights of stairs philosophizing as i went and with some difficulty found my way into the room where mrs bloomfield awaited me she led me into the dining room where the family luncheon had been laid out some beefsteaks and half cold potatoes were set before me and while i dined upon these she sat opposite watching me as i thought and endeavouring to sustain something like a conversation consisting chiefly of a succession of commonplace remarks expressed with frigid formality but this might be more my fault than hers for i really could _not_ converse in fact my attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner not from ravenous appetite but from distress at the toughness of the beefsteaks and the numbness of my hands almost palsied by their five hours exposure to the bitter wind i would gladly have eaten the potatoes and let the meat alone but having got a large piece of the latter on to my plate i could not be so impolite as to leave it so after many awkward and unsuccessful attempts to cut it with the knife or tear it with the fork or pull it asunder between them sensible that the awful lady was a spectator to the whole transaction i at last desperately grasped the knife and fork in my fists like a child of two years old and fell to work with all the little strength i possessed but this needed some apology with a feeble attempt at a laugh i said my hands are so benumbed with the cold that i can scarcely handle my knife and fork i daresay you would find it cold replied she with a cool immutable gravity that did not serve to reassure me when the ceremony was concluded she led me into the sitting room again where she rang and sent for the children you will find them not very far advanced in their attainments said she for i have had so little time to attend to their education myself and we have thought them too young for a governess till now but i think they are clever children and very apt to learn especially the little boy he is i think the flower of the flock a generous noble spirited boy one to be led but not driven and remarkable for always speaking the truth he seems to scorn deception this was good news his sister mary ann will require watching continued she but she is a very good girl upon the whole though i wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible as she is now almost six years old and might acquire bad habits from the nurses i have ordered her crib to be placed in your room and if you will be so kind as to overlook her washing and dressing and take charge of her clothes she need have nothing further to do with the nursery maid i replied i was quite willing to do so and at that moment my young pupils entered the apartment with their two younger sisters master tom bloomfield was a well grown boy of seven with a somewhat wiry frame flaxen hair blue eyes small turned up nose and fair complexion mary ann was a tall girl too somewhat dark like her mother but with a round full face and a high colour in her cheeks the second sister was fanny a very pretty little girl mrs bloomfield assured me she was a remarkably gentle child and required encouragement she had not learned anything yet but in a few days she would be four years old and then she might take her first lesson in the alphabet and be promoted to the schoolroom the remaining one was harriet a little broad fat merry playful thing of scarcely two that i coveted more than all the rest but with her i had nothing to do i talked to my little pupils as well as i could and tried to render myself agreeable but with little success i fear for their mother's presence kept me under an unpleasant restraint they however were remarkably free from shyness they seemed bold lively children and i hoped i should soon be on friendly terms with them the little boy especially of whom i had heard such a favourable character from his mamma in mary ann there was a certain affected simper and a craving for notice that i was sorry to observe but her brother claimed all my attention to himself he stood bolt upright between me and the fire with his hands behind his back talking away like an orator occasionally interrupting his discourse with a sharp reproof to his sisters when they made too much noise oh tom what a darling you are exclaimed his mother come and kiss dear mamma and then won't you show miss grey your schoolroom and your nice new books i won't kiss _you_ mamma but i _will_ show miss grey my schoolroom and my new books and _my_ schoolroom and _my_ new books tom said mary ann they're mine too they're _mine_ replied he decisively come along miss grey i'll escort you when the room and books had been shown with some bickerings between the brother and sister that i did my utmost to appease or mitigate mary ann brought me her doll and began to be very loquacious on the subject of its fine clothes its bed its chest of drawers and other appurtenances but tom told her to hold her clamour that miss grey might see his rocking horse which with a most important bustle he dragged forth from its corner into the middle of the room loudly calling on me to attend to it then ordering his sister to hold the reins he mounted and made me stand for ten minutes watching how manfully he used his whip and spurs meantime however i admired mary ann's pretty doll and all its possessions and then told master tom he was a capital rider but i hoped he would not use his whip and spurs so much when he rode a real pony oh yes i will said he laying on with redoubled ardour i'll cut into him like smoke eeh my word but he shall sweat for it this was very shocking but i hoped in time to be able to work a reformation now you must put on your bonnet and shawl said the little hero and i'll show you my garden and _mine_ said mary ann tom lifted his fist with a menacing gesture she uttered a loud shrill scream ran to the other side of me and made a face at him surely tom you would not strike your sister i hope i shall _never_ see you do that you will sometimes i'm obliged to do it now and then to keep her in order but it is not your business to keep her in order you know that is for well now go and put on your bonnet i don't know it is so very cloudy and cold it seems likely to rain and you know i have had a long drive no matter you _must_ come i shall allow of no excuses replied the consequential little gentleman and as it was the first day of our acquaintance i thought i might as well indulge him it was too cold for mary ann to venture so she stayed with her mamma to the great relief of her brother who liked to have me all to himself the garden was a large one and tastefully laid out besides several splendid dahlias there were some other fine flowers still in bloom but my companion would not give me time to examine them i must go with him across the wet grass to a remote sequestered corner the most important place in the grounds because it contained _his_ garden there were two round beds stocked with a variety of plants in one there was a pretty little rose tree i paused to admire its lovely blossoms oh never mind that said he contemptuously that's only _mary ann's_ garden look this is mine after i had observed every flower and listened to a disquisition on every plant i was permitted to depart but first with great pomp he plucked a polyanthus and presented it to me as one conferring a prodigious favour i observed on the grass about his garden certain apparatus of sticks and corn and asked what they were traps for birds why do you catch them papa says they do harm and what do you do with them when you catch them different things sometimes i give them to the cat sometimes i cut them in pieces with my penknife but the next i mean to roast alive and why do you mean to do such a horrible thing for two reasons first to see how long it will live and then to see what it will taste like but don't you know it is extremely wicked to do such things remember the birds can feel as well as you and think how would you like it yourself oh that's nothing i'm not a bird and i can't feel what i do to them but you will have to feel it some time tom you have heard where wicked people go to when they die and if you don't leave off torturing innocent birds remember you will have to go there and suffer just what you have made them suffer oh pooh i shan't papa knows how i treat them and he never blames me for it he says it is just what _he_ used to do when _he_ was a boy last summer he gave me a nest full of young sparrows and he saw me pulling off their legs and wings and heads and never said anything except that they were nasty things and i must not let them soil my trousers and uncle robson was there too and he laughed and said i was a fine boy but what would your mamma say oh she doesn't care she says it's a pity to kill the pretty singing birds but the naughty sparrows and mice and rats i may do what i like with so now miss grey you see it is _not_ wicked i still think it is tom and perhaps your papa and mamma would think so too if they thought much about it however i internally added they may say what they please but i am determined you shall do nothing of the kind as long as i have power to prevent it he next took me across the lawn to see his mole traps and then into the stack yard to see his weasel traps one of which to his great joy contained a dead weasel and then into the stable to see not the fine carriage horses but a little rough colt which he informed me had been bred on purpose for him and he was to ride it as soon as it was properly trained i tried to amuse the little fellow and listened to all his chatter as complacently as i could for i thought if he had any affections at all i would endeavour to win them and then in time i might be able to show him the error of his ways but i looked in vain for that generous noble spirit his mother talked of though i could see he was not without a certain degree of quickness and penetration when he chose to exert it when we re entered the house it was nearly tea time master tom told me that as papa was from home he and i and mary ann were to have tea with mamma for a treat for on such occasions she always dined at luncheon time with them instead of at six o'clock soon after tea mary ann went to bed but tom favoured us with his company and conversation till eight after he was gone mrs bloomfield further enlightened me on the subject of her children's dispositions and acquirements and on what they were to learn and how they were to be managed and cautioned me to mention their defects to no one but herself my mother had warned me before to mention them as little as possible to _her_ for people did not like to be told of their children's faults and so i concluded i was to keep silence on them altogether about half past nine mrs bloomfield invited me to partake of a frugal supper of cold meat and bread i was glad when that was over and she took her bedroom candlestick and retired to rest for though i wished to be pleased with her her company was extremely irksome to me and i could not help feeling that she was cold grave and forbidding the very opposite of the kind warm hearted matron my hopes had depicted her to be chapter iii a few more lessons i rose next morning with a feeling of hopeful exhilaration in spite of the disappointments already experienced but i found the dressing of mary ann was no light matter as her abundant hair was to be smeared with pomade plaited in three long tails and tied with bows of ribbon a task my unaccustomed fingers found great difficulty in performing she told me her nurse could do it in half the time and by keeping up a constant fidget of impatience contrived to render me still longer when all was done we went into the schoolroom where i met my other pupil and chatted with the two till it was time to go down to breakfast that meal being concluded and a few civil words having been exchanged with mrs bloomfield we repaired to the schoolroom again and commenced the business of the day i found my pupils very backward indeed but tom though averse to every species of mental exertion was not without abilities mary ann could scarcely read a word and was so careless and inattentive that i could hardly get on with her at all however by dint of great labour and patience i managed to get something done in the course of the morning and then accompanied my young charge out into the garden and adjacent grounds for a little recreation before dinner there we got along tolerably together except that i found they had no notion of going with me i must go with them wherever they chose to lead me i must run walk or stand exactly as it suited their fancy this i thought was reversing the order of things and i found it doubly disagreeable as on this as well as subsequent occasions they seemed to prefer the dirtiest places and the most dismal occupations but there was no remedy either i must follow them or keep entirely apart from them and thus appear neglectful of my charge to day they manifested a particular attachment to a well at the bottom of the lawn where they persisted in dabbling with sticks and pebbles for above half an hour i was in constant fear that their mother would see them from the window and blame me for allowing them thus to draggle their clothes and wet their feet and hands instead of taking exercise but no arguments commands or entreaties could draw them away if _she_ did not see them some one else did a gentleman on horseback had entered the gate and was proceeding up the road at the distance of a few paces from us he paused and calling to the children in a waspish penetrating tone bade them keep out of that water miss grey said he i suppose it _is_ miss grey i am surprised that you should allow them to dirty their clothes in that manner don't you see how miss bloomfield has soiled her frock and that master bloomfield's socks are quite wet and both of them without gloves dear dear let me _request_ that in future you will keep them _decent_ at least so saying he turned away and continued his ride up to the house this was mr bloomfield i was surprised that he should nominate his children master and miss bloomfield and still more so that he should speak so uncivilly to me their governess and a perfect stranger to himself presently the bell rang to summon us in i dined with the children at one while he and his lady took their luncheon at the same table his conduct there did not greatly raise him in my estimation he was a man of ordinary stature rather below than above and rather thin than stout apparently between thirty and forty years of age he had a large mouth pale dingy complexion milky blue eyes and hair the colour of a hempen cord there was a roast leg of mutton before him he helped mrs bloomfield the children and me desiring me to cut up the children's meat then after twisting about the mutton in various directions and eyeing it from different points he pronounced it not fit to be eaten and called for the cold beef what is the matter with the mutton my dear asked his mate it is quite overdone don't you taste mrs bloomfield that all the goodness is roasted out of it and can't you see that all that nice red gravy is completely dried away well i think the _beef_ will suit you the beef was set before him and he began to carve but with the most rueful expressions of discontent what is the matter with the _beef_ mr bloomfield i'm sure i thought it was very nice and so it _was_ very nice a nicer joint could not be but it is _quite_ spoiled replied he dolefully how so how so why don't you see how it is cut dear dear it is quite shocking they must have cut it wrong in the kitchen then for i'm sure i carved it quite properly here yesterday no _doubt_ they cut it wrong in the kitchen the savages dear dear did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined but remember that in future when a decent dish leaves this table they shall not _touch_ it in the kitchen remember _that_ mrs bloomfield notwithstanding the ruinous state of the beef the gentleman managed to cut himself some delicate slices part of which he ate in silence when he next spoke it was in a less querulous tone to ask what there was for dinner turkey and grouse was the concise reply and what besides fish what kind of fish i don't know _you don't know_ cried he looking solemnly up from his plate and suspending his knife and fork in astonishment no i told the cook to get some fish i did not particularize what well that beats everything a lady professes to keep house and doesn't even know what fish is for dinner professes to order fish and doesn't specify what perhaps mr bloomfield you will order dinner yourself in future nothing more was said and i was very glad to get out of the room with my pupils for i never felt so ashamed and uncomfortable in my life for anything that was not my own fault in the afternoon we applied to lessons again then went out again then had tea in the schoolroom then i dressed mary ann for dessert and when she and her brother had gone down to the dining room i took the opportunity of beginning a letter to my dear friends at home but the children came up before i had half completed it at seven i had to put mary ann to bed then i played with tom till eight when he too went and i finished my letter and unpacked my clothes which i had hitherto found no opportunity for doing and finally went to bed myself but this is a very favourable specimen of a day's proceedings my task of instruction and surveillance instead of becoming easier as my charges and i got better accustomed to each other became more arduous as their characters unfolded the name of governess i soon found was a mere mockery as applied to me my pupils had no more notion of obedience than a wild unbroken colt the habitual fear of their father's peevish temper and the dread of the punishments he was wont to inflict when irritated kept them generally within bounds in his immediate presence the girls too had some fear of their mother's anger and the boy might occasionally be bribed to do as she bid him by the hope of reward but i had no rewards to offer and as for punishments i was given to understand the parents reserved that privilege to themselves and yet they expected me to keep my pupils in order other children might be guided by the fear of anger and the desire of approbation but neither the one nor the other had any effect upon these master tom not content with refusing to be ruled must needs set up as a ruler and manifested a determination to keep not only his sisters but his governess in order by violent manual and pedal applications and as he was a tall strong boy of his years this occasioned no trifling inconvenience a few sound boxes on the ear on such occasions might have settled the matter easily enough but as in that case he might make up some story to his mother which she would be sure to believe as she had such unshaken faith in his veracity though i had already discovered it to be by no means unimpeachable i determined to refrain from striking him even in self defence and in his most violent moods my only resource was to throw him on his back and hold his hands and feet till the frenzy was somewhat abated to the difficulty of preventing him from doing what he ought not was added that of forcing him to do what he ought often he would positively refuse to learn or to repeat his lessons or even to look at his book here again a good birch rod might have been serviceable but as my powers were so limited i must make the best use of what i had as there were no settled hours for study and play i resolved to give my pupils a certain task which with moderate attention they could perform in a short time and till this was done however weary i was or however perverse they might be nothing short of parental interference should induce me to suffer them to leave the schoolroom even if i should sit with my chair against the door to keep them in patience firmness and perseverance were my only weapons and these i resolved to use to the utmost i determined always strictly to fulfil the threats and promises i made and to that end i must be cautious to threaten and promise nothing that i could not perform then i would carefully refrain from all useless irritability and indulgence of my own ill temper when they behaved tolerably i would be as kind and obliging as it was in my power to be in order to make the widest possible distinction between good and bad conduct i would reason with them too in the simplest and most effective manner when i reproved them or refused to gratify their wishes after a glaring fault it should be more in sorrow than in anger their little hymns and prayers i would make plain and clear to their understanding when they said their prayers at night and asked pardon for their offences i would remind them of the sins of the past day solemnly but in perfect kindness to avoid raising a spirit of opposition penitential hymns should be said by the naughty cheerful ones by the comparatively good and every kind of instruction i would convey to them as much as possible by entertaining discourse apparently with no other object than their present amusement in view by these means i hoped in time both to benefit the children and to gain the approbation of their parents and also to convince my friends at home that i was not so wanting in skill and prudence as they supposed i knew the difficulties i had to contend with were great but i knew at least i believed unremitting patience and perseverance could overcome them and night and morning i implored divine assistance to this end but either the children were so incorrigible the parents so unreasonable or myself so mistaken in my views or so unable to carry them out that my best intentions and most strenuous efforts seemed productive of no better result than sport to the children dissatisfaction to their parents and torment to myself the task of instruction was as arduous for the body as the mind i had to run after my pupils to catch them to carry or drag them to the table and often forcibly to hold them there till the lesson was done tom i frequently put into a corner seating myself before him in a chair with a book which contained the little task that must be said or read before he was released in my hand he was not strong enough to push both me and the chair away so he would stand twisting his body and face into the most grotesque and singular contortions laughable no doubt to an unconcerned spectator but not to me and uttering loud yells and doleful outcries intended to represent weeping but wholly without the accompaniment of tears i knew this was done solely for the purpose of annoying me and therefore however i might inwardly tremble with impatience and irritation i manfully strove to suppress all visible signs of molestation and affected to sit with calm indifference waiting till it should please him to cease this pastime and prepare for a run in the garden by casting his eye on the book and reading or repeating the few words he was required to say sometimes he was determined to do his writing badly and i had to hold his hand to prevent him from purposely blotting or disfiguring the paper frequently i threatened that if he did not do better he should have another line then he would stubbornly refuse to write this line and i to save my word had finally to resort to the expedient of holding his fingers upon the pen and forcibly drawing his hand up and down till in spite of his resistance the line was in some sort completed yet tom was by no means the most unmanageable of my pupils sometimes to my great joy he would have the sense to see that his wisest policy was to finish his tasks and go out and amuse himself till i and his sisters came to join him which frequently was not at all for mary ann seldom followed his example in this particular she apparently preferred rolling on the floor to any other amusement down she would drop like a leaden weight and when i with great difficulty had succeeded in rooting her thence i had still to hold her up with one arm while with the other i held the book from which she was to read or spell her lesson as the dead weight of the big girl of six became too heavy for one arm to bear i transferred it to the other or if both were weary of the burden i carried her into a corner and told her she might come out when she should find the use of her feet and stand up but she generally preferred lying there like a log till dinner or tea time when as i could not deprive her of her meals she must be liberated and would come crawling out with a grin of triumph on her round red face often she would stubbornly refuse to pronounce some particular word in her lesson and now i regret the lost labour i have had in striving to conquer her obstinacy if i had passed it over as a matter of no consequence it would have been better for both parties than vainly striving to overcome it as i did but i thought it my absolute duty to crush this vicious tendency in the bud and so it was if i could have done it and had my powers been less limited i might have enforced obedience but as it was it was a trial of strength between her and me in which she generally came off victorious and every victory served to encourage and strengthen her for a future contest in vain i argued coaxed entreated threatened scolded in vain i kept her in from play or if obliged to take her out refused to play with her or to speak kindly or have anything to do with her in vain i tried to set before her the advantages of doing as she was bid and being loved and kindly treated in consequence and the disadvantages of persisting in her absurd perversity sometimes when she would ask me to do something for her i would answer yes i will mary ann if you will only say that word come you'd better say it at once and have no more trouble about it no then of course i can do nothing"
