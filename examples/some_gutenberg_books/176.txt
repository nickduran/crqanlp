"1" "as he had not called for some days it was likely he would come that evening rowland left alone examined the statuette at his leisure and returned more than once during the day to take another look at it he discovered its weak points but it wore well it had the stamp of genius rowland envied the happy youth who in a new england village without aid or encouragement without models or resources had found it so easy to produce a lovely work in the evening as he was smoking his cigar on the veranda a light quick step pressed the gravel of the garden path and in a moment a young man made his bow to cecilia it was rather a nod than a bow and indicated either that he was an old friend or that he was scantily versed in the usual social forms cecilia who was sitting near the steps pointed to a neighboring chair but the young man seated himself abruptly on the floor at her feet began to fan himself vigorously with his hat and broke out into a lively objurgation upon the hot weather i m dripping wet he said without ceremony you walk too fast said cecilia you do everything too fast i know it i know it he cried passing his hand through his abundant dark hair and making it stand out in a picturesque shock i can't be slow if i try there s something inside of me that drives me a restless fiend cecilia gave a light laugh and rowland leaned forward in his hammock he had placed himself in it at bessie's request and was playing that he was her baby and that she was rocking him to sleep she sat beside him swinging the hammock to and fro and singing a lullaby when he raised himself she pushed him back and said that the baby must finish its nap but i want to see the gentleman with the fiend inside of him said rowland what is a fiend bessie demanded it s only mr hudson very well i want to see him oh never mind him said bessie with the brevity of contempt you speak as if you did n't like him i don't bessie affirmed and put rowland to bed again the hammock was swung at the end of the veranda in the thickest shade of the vines and this fragment of dialogue had passed unnoticed rowland submitted a while longer to be cradled and contented himself with listening to mr hudson's voice it was a soft and not altogether masculine organ and was pitched on this occasion in a somewhat plaintive and pettish key the young man's mood seemed fretful he complained of the heat of the dust of a shoe that hurt him of having gone on an errand a mile to the other side of the town and found the person he was in search of had left northampton an hour before won't you have a cup of tea cecilia asked perhaps that will restore your equanimity aye by keeping me awake all night said hudson at the best it s hard enough to go down to the office with my nerves set on edge by a sleepless night i should perforce stay at home and be brutal to my poor mother your mother is well i hope oh she s as usual and miss garland she s as usual too every one everything is as usual nothing ever happens in this benighted town i beg your pardon things do happen sometimes said cecilia here is a dear cousin of mine arrived on purpose to congratulate you on your statuette and she called to rowland to come and be introduced to mr hudson the young man sprang up with alacrity and rowland coming forward to shake hands had a good look at him in the light projected from the parlor window something seemed to shine out of hudson's face as a warning against a compliment of the idle unpondered sort your statuette seems to me very good rowland said gravely it has given me extreme pleasure and my cousin knows what is good said cecilia he s a connoisseur hudson smiled and stared a connoisseur he cried laughing he s the first i ve ever seen let me see what they look like and he drew rowland nearer to the light have they all such good heads as that i should like to model yours pray do said cecilia it will keep him a while he is running off to europe ah to europe hudson exclaimed with a melancholy cadence as they sat down happy man but the note seemed to rowland to be struck rather at random for he perceived no echo of it in the boyish garrulity of his later talk hudson was a tall slender young fellow with a singularly mobile and intelligent face rowland was struck at first only with its responsive vivacity but in a short time he perceived it was remarkably handsome the features were admirably chiseled and finished and a frank smile played over them as gracefully as a breeze among flowers the fault of the young man's whole structure was an excessive want of breadth the forehead though it was high and rounded was narrow the jaw and the shoulders were narrow and the result was an air of insufficient physical substance but mallet afterwards learned that this fair slim youth could draw indefinitely upon a mysterious fund of nervous force which outlasted and outwearied the endurance of many a sturdier temperament and certainly there was life enough in his eye to furnish an immortality it was a generous dark gray eye in which there came and went a sort of kindling glow which would have made a ruder visage striking and which gave at times to hudson's harmonious face an altogether extraordinary beauty there was to rowland's sympathetic sense a slightly pitiful disparity between the young sculptor's delicate countenance and the shabby gentility of his costume he was dressed for a visit a visit to a pretty woman he was clad from head to foot in a white linen suit which had never been remarkable for the felicity of its cut and had now quite lost that crispness which garments of this complexion can as ill spare as the back scene of a theatre the radiance of the footlights he wore a vivid blue cravat passed through a ring altogether too splendid to be valuable he pulled and twisted as he sat a pair of yellow kid gloves he emphasized his conversation with great dashes and flourishes of a light silver tipped walking stick and he kept constantly taking off and putting on one of those slouched sombreros which are the traditional property of the virginian or carolinian of romance when this was on he was very picturesque in spite of his mock elegance and when it was off and he sat nursing it and turning it about and not knowing what to do with it he could hardly be said to be awkward he evidently had a natural relish for brilliant accessories and appropriated what came to his hand this was visible in his talk which abounded in the florid and sonorous he liked words with color in them rowland who was but a moderate talker sat by in silence while cecilia who had told him that she desired his opinion upon her friend used a good deal of characteristic finesse in leading the young man to expose himself she perfectly succeeded and hudson rattled away for an hour with a volubility in which boyish unconsciousness and manly shrewdness were singularly combined he gave his opinion on twenty topics he opened up an endless budget of local gossip he described his repulsive routine at the office of messrs striker and spooner counselors at law and he gave with great felicity and gusto an account of the annual boat race between harvard and yale which he had lately witnessed at worcester he had looked at the straining oarsmen and the swaying crowd with the eye of the sculptor rowland was a good deal amused and not a little interested whenever hudson uttered some peculiarly striking piece of youthful grandiloquence cecilia broke into a long light familiar laugh what are you laughing at the young man then demanded have i said anything so ridiculous go on go on cecilia replied you are too delicious show mr mallet how mr striker read the declaration of independence hudson like most men with a turn for the plastic arts was an excellent mimic and he represented with a great deal of humor the accent and attitude of a pompous country lawyer sustaining the burden of this customary episode of our national festival the sonorous twang the see saw gestures the odd pronunciation were vividly depicted but cecilia's manner and the young man's quick response ruffled a little poor rowland's paternal conscience he wondered whether his cousin was not sacrificing the faculty of reverence in her clever protege to her need for amusement hudson made no serious rejoinder to rowland's compliment on his statuette until he rose to go rowland wondered whether he had forgotten it and supposed that the oversight was a sign of the natural self sufficiency of genius but hudson stood a moment before he said good night twirled his sombrero and hesitated for the first time he gave rowland a clear penetrating glance and then with a wonderfully frank appealing smile you really meant he asked what you said a while ago about that thing of mine it is good essentially good i really meant it said rowland laying a kindly hand on his shoulder it is very good indeed it is as you say essentially good that is the beauty of it hudson's eyes glowed and expanded he looked at rowland for some time in silence i have a notion you really know he said at last but if you don't it does n't much matter my cousin asked me to day said cecilia whether i supposed you knew yourself how good it is hudson stared blushing a little perhaps not he cried very likely said mallet i read in a book the other day that great talent in action in fact the book said genius is a kind of somnambulism the artist performs great feats in a dream we must not wake him up lest he should lose his balance oh when he s back in bed again hudson answered with a laugh yes call it a dream it was a very happy one tell me this said rowland did you mean anything by your young water drinker does he represent an idea is he a symbol hudson raised his eyebrows and gently scratched his head why he s youth you know he s innocence he s health he s strength he s curiosity yes he s a good many things and is the cup also a symbol the cup is knowledge pleasure experience anything of that kind well he s guzzling in earnest said rowland hudson gave a vigorous nod aye poor fellow he s thirsty and on this he cried good night and bounded down the garden path well what do you make of him asked cecilia returning a short time afterwards from a visit of investigation as to the sufficiency of bessie's bedclothes i confess i like him said rowland he s very immature but there s stuff in him he s a strange being said cecilia musingly who are his people what has been his education rowland asked he has had no education beyond what he has picked up with little trouble for himself his mother is a widow of a massachusetts country family a little timid tremulous woman who is always on pins and needles about her son she had some property herself and married a virginian gentleman of good estates he turned out i believe a very licentious personage and made great havoc in their fortune everything or almost everything melted away including mr hudson himself this is literally true for he drank himself to death ten years ago his wife was left a widow with scanty means and a couple of growing boys she paid her husband's debts as best she could and came to establish herself here where by the death of a charitable relative she had inherited an old fashioned ruinous house roderick our friend was her pride and joy but stephen the elder was her comfort and support i remember him later he was an ugly sturdy practical lad very different from his brother and in his way i imagine a very fine fellow when the war broke out he found that the new england blood ran thicker in his veins than the virginian and immediately obtained a commission he fell in some western battle and left his mother inconsolable roderick however has given her plenty to think about and she has induced him by some mysterious art to abide nominally at least in a profession that he abhors and for which he is about as fit i should say as i am to drive a locomotive he grew up a la grace de dieu and was horribly spoiled three or four years ago he graduated at a small college in this neighborhood where i am afraid he had given a good deal more attention to novels and billiards than to mathematics and greek since then he has been reading law at the rate of a page a day if he is ever admitted to practice i m afraid my friendship won't avail to make me give him my business good bad or indifferent the boy is essentially an artist an artist to his fingers ends why then asked rowland does n't he deliberately take up the chisel for several reasons in the first place i don't think he more than half suspects his talent the flame is smouldering but it is never fanned by the breath of criticism he sees nothing hears nothing to help him to self knowledge he s hopelessly discontented but he does n't know where to look for help then his mother as she one day confessed to me has a holy horror of a profession which consists exclusively as she supposes in making figures of people without their clothes on sculpture to her mind is an insidious form of immorality and for a young man of a passionate disposition she considers the law a much safer investment her father was a judge she has two brothers at the bar and her elder son had made a very promising beginning in the same line she wishes the tradition to be perpetuated i m pretty sure the law won't make roderick's fortune and i m afraid it will in the long run spoil his temper what sort of a temper is it one to be trusted on the whole it is quick but it is generous i have known it to breathe flame and fury at ten o'clock in the evening and soft sweet music early on the morrow it s a very entertaining temper to observe i fortunately can do so dispassionately for i m the only person in the place he has not quarreled with has he then no society who is miss garland whom you asked about a young girl staying with his mother a sort of far away cousin a good plain girl but not a person to delight a sculptor's eye roderick has a goodly share of the old southern arrogance he has the aristocratic temperament he will have nothing to do with the small towns people he says they re ignoble he cannot endure his mother's friends the old ladies and the ministers and the tea party people they bore him to death so he comes and lounges here and rails at everything and every one this graceful young scoffer reappeared a couple of evenings later and confirmed the friendly feeling he had provoked on rowland's part he was in an easier mood than before he chattered less extravagantly and asked rowland a number of rather naif questions about the condition of the fine arts in new york and boston cecilia when he had gone said that this was the wholesome effect of rowland's praise of his statuette roderick was acutely sensitive and rowland's tranquil commendation had stilled his restless pulses he was ruminating the full flavored verdict of culture rowland felt an irresistible kindness for him a mingled sense of his personal charm and his artistic capacity he had an indefinable attraction the something divine of unspotted exuberant confident youth the next day was sunday and rowland proposed that they should take a long walk and that roderick should show him the country the young man assented gleefully and in the morning as rowland at the garden gate was giving his hostess godspeed on her way to church he came striding along the grassy margin of the road and out whistling the music of the church bells it was one of those lovely days of august when you feel the complete exuberance of summer just warned and checked by autumn remember the day and take care you rob no orchards said cecilia as they separated the young men walked away at a steady pace over hill and dale through woods and fields and at last found themselves on a grassy elevation studded with mossy rocks and red cedars just beneath them in a great shining curve flowed the goodly connecticut they flung themselves on the grass and tossed stones into the river they talked like old friends rowland lit a cigar and roderick refused one with a grimace of extravagant disgust he thought them vile things he did n't see how decent people could tolerate them rowland was amused and wondered what it was that made this ill mannered speech seem perfectly inoffensive on roderick's lips he belonged to the race of mortals to be pitied or envied according as we view the matter who are not held to a strict account for their aggressions looking at him as he lay stretched in the shade rowland vaguely likened him to some beautiful supple restless bright eyed animal whose motions should have no deeper warrant than the tremulous delicacy of its structure and be graceful even when they were most inconvenient rowland watched the shadows on mount holyoke listened to the gurgle of the river and sniffed the balsam of the pines a gentle breeze had begun to tickle their summits and brought the smell of the mown grass across from the elm dotted river meadows he sat up beside his companion and looked away at the far spreading view it seemed to him beautiful and suddenly a strange feeling of prospective regret took possession of him something seemed to tell him that later in a foreign land he would remember it lovingly and penitently it s a wretched business he said this practical quarrel of ours with our own country this everlasting impatience to get out of it is one's only safety then in flight this is an american day an american landscape an american atmosphere it certainly has its merits and some day when i am shivering with ague in classic italy i shall accuse myself of having slighted them roderick kindled with a sympathetic glow and declared that america was good enough for him and that he had always thought it the duty of an honest citizen to stand by his own country and help it along he had evidently thought nothing whatever about it and was launching his doctrine on the inspiration of the moment the doctrine expanded with the occasion and he declared that he was above all an advocate for american art he did n't see why we should n't produce the greatest works in the world we were the biggest people and we ought to have the biggest conceptions the biggest conceptions of course would bring forth in time the biggest performances we had only to be true to ourselves to pitch in and not be afraid to fling imitation overboard and fix our eyes upon our national individuality i declare he cried there s a career for a man and i ve twenty minds to decide on the spot to embrace it to be the consummate typical original national american artist it s inspiring rowland burst out laughing and told him that he liked his practice better than his theory and that a saner impulse than this had inspired his little water drinker roderick took no offense and three minutes afterwards was talking volubly of some humbler theme but half heeded by his companion who had returned to his cogitations at last rowland delivered himself of the upshot of these how would you like he suddenly demanded to go to rome hudson stared and with a hungry laugh which speedily consigned our national individuality to perdition responded that he would like it reasonably well and i should like by the same token he added to go to athens to constantinople to damascus to the holy city of benares where there is a golden statue of brahma twenty feet tall nay said rowland soberly if you were to go to rome you should settle down and work athens might help you but for the present i should n't recommend benares it will be time to arrange details when i pack my trunk said hudson if you mean to turn sculptor the sooner you pack your trunk the better oh but i m a practical man what is the smallest sum per annum on which one can keep alive the sacred fire in rome what is the largest sum at your disposal roderick stroked his light moustache gave it a twist and then announced with mock pomposity three hundred dollars the money question could be arranged said rowland there are ways of raising money i should like to know a few i never yet discovered one one consists said rowland in having a friend with a good deal more than he wants and not being too proud to accept a part of it roderick stared a moment and his face flushed do you mean do you mean he stammered he was greatly excited rowland got up blushing a little and roderick sprang to his feet in three words if you are to be a sculptor you ought to go to rome and study the antique to go to rome you need money i m fond of fine statues but unfortunately i can't make them myself i have to order them i order a dozen from you to be executed at your convenience to help you i pay you in advance roderick pushed off his hat and wiped his forehead still gazing at his companion you believe in me he cried at last allow me to explain said rowland i believe in you if you are prepared to work and to wait and to struggle and to exercise a great many virtues and then i m afraid to say it lest i should disturb you more than i should help you you must decide for yourself i simply offer you an opportunity hudson stood for some time profoundly meditative you have not seen my other things he said suddenly come and look at them now yes we ll walk home we ll settle the question he passed his hand through rowland's arm and they retraced their steps they reached the town and made their way along a broad country street dusky with the shade of magnificent elms rowland felt his companion's arm trembling in his own they stopped at a large white house flanked with melancholy hemlocks and passed through a little front garden paved with moss coated bricks and ornamented with parterres bordered with high box hedges the mansion had an air of antiquated dignity but it had seen its best days and evidently sheltered a shrunken household mrs hudson rowland was sure might be seen in the garden of a morning in a white apron and a pair of old gloves engaged in frugal horticulture roderick's studio was behind in the basement a large empty room with the paper peeling off the walls this represented in the fashion of fifty years ago a series of small fantastic landscapes of a hideous pattern and the young sculptor had presumably torn it away in great scraps in moments of aesthetic exasperation on a board in a corner was a heap of clay and on the floor against the wall stood some dozen medallions busts and figures in various stages of completion to exhibit them roderick had to place them one by one on the end of a long packing box which served as a pedestal he did so silently making no explanations and looking at them himself with a strange air of quickened curiosity most of the things were portraits and the three at which he looked longest were finished busts one was a colossal head of a negro tossed back defiant with distended nostrils one was the portrait of a young man whom rowland immediately perceived by the resemblance to be his deceased brother the last represented a gentleman with a pointed nose a long shaved upper lip and a tuft on the end of his chin this was a face peculiarly unadapted to sculpture but as a piece of modeling it was the best and it was admirable it reminded rowland in its homely veracity its artless artfulness of the works of the early italian renaissance on the pedestal was cut the name barnaby striker esq rowland remembered that this was the appellation of the legal luminary from whom his companion had undertaken to borrow a reflected ray and although in the bust there was naught flagrantly set down in malice it betrayed comically to one who could relish the secret that the features of the original had often been scanned with an irritated eye besides these there were several rough studies of the nude and two or three figures of a fanciful kind the most noticeable and it had singular beauty was a small modeled design for a sepulchral monument that evidently of stephen hudson the young soldier lay sleeping eternally with his hand on his sword like an old crusader in a gothic cathedral rowland made no haste to pronounce too much depended on his judgment upon my word cried hudson at last they seem to me very good and in truth as rowland looked he saw they were good they were youthful awkward and ignorant the effort often was more apparent than the success but the effort was signally powerful and intelligent it seemed to rowland that it needed only to let itself go to compass great things here and there too success when grasped had something masterly rowland turned to his companion who stood with his hands in his pockets and his hair very much crumpled looking at him askance the light of admiration was in rowland's eyes and it speedily kindled a wonderful illumination on hudson's handsome brow rowland said at last gravely you have only to work i think i know what that means roderick answered he turned away threw himself on a rickety chair and sat for some moments with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands work work he said at last looking up ah if i could only begin he glanced round the room a moment and his eye encountered on the mantel shelf the vivid physiognomy of mr barnaby striker his smile vanished and he stared at it with an air of concentrated enmity i want to begin he cried and i can't make a better beginning than this good by mr striker he strode across the room seized a mallet that lay at hand and before rowland could interfere in the interest of art if not of morals dealt a merciless blow upon mr striker's skull the bust cracked into a dozen pieces which toppled with a great crash upon the floor rowland relished neither the destruction of the image nor his companion's look in working it but as he was about to express his displeasure the door opened and gave passage to a young girl she came in with a rapid step and startled face as if she had been summoned by the noise seeing the heap of shattered clay and the mallet in roderick's hand she gave a cry of horror her voice died away when she perceived that rowland was a stranger but she murmured reproachfully why roderick what have you done roderick gave a joyous kick to the shapeless fragments i ve driven the money changers out of the temple he cried the traces retained shape enough to be recognized and she gave a little moan of pity she seemed not to understand the young man's allegory but yet to feel that it pointed to some great purpose which must be an evil one from being expressed in such a lawless fashion and to perceive that rowland was in some way accountable for it she looked at him with a sharp frank mistrust and turned away through the open door rowland looked after her with extraordinary interest chapter ii roderick early on the morrow rowland received a visit from his new friend roderick was in a state of extreme exhilaration tempered however by a certain amount of righteous wrath he had had a domestic struggle but he had remained master of the situation he had shaken the dust of mr striker's office from his feet i had it out last night with my mother he said i dreaded the scene for she takes things terribly hard she does n't"
