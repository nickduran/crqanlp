"1" "a manly and pathetic letter to miss pinkerton recommending the orphan child to her protection and so descended to the grave after two bailiffs had quarrelled over his corpse rebecca was seventeen when she came to chiswick and was bound over as an articled pupil her duties being to talk french as we have seen and her privileges to live cost free and with a few guineas a year to gather scraps of knowledge from the professors who attended the school she was small and slight in person pale sandy haired and with eyes habitually cast down when they looked up they were very large odd and attractive so attractive that the reverend mr crisp fresh from oxford and curate to the vicar of chiswick the reverend mr flowerdew fell in love with miss sharp being shot dead by a glance of her eyes which was fired all the way across chiswick church from the school pew to the reading desk this infatuated young man used sometimes to take tea with miss pinkerton to whom he had been presented by his mamma and actually proposed something like marriage in an intercepted note which the one eyed apple woman was charged to deliver mrs crisp was summoned from buxton and abruptly carried off her darling boy but the idea even of such an eagle in the chiswick dovecot caused a great flutter in the breast of miss pinkerton who would have sent away miss sharp but that she was bound to her under a forfeit and who never could thoroughly believe the young lady's protestations that she had never exchanged a single word with mr crisp except under her own eyes on the two occasions when she had met him at tea by the side of many tall and bouncing young ladies in the establishment rebecca sharp looked like a child but she had the dismal precocity of poverty many a dun had she talked to and turned away from her father's door many a tradesman had she coaxed and wheedled into good humour and into the granting of one meal more she sate commonly with her father who was very proud of her wit and heard the talk of many of his wild companions often but ill suited for a girl to hear but she never had been a girl she said she had been a woman since she was eight years old oh why did miss pinkerton let such a dangerous bird into her cage the fact is the old lady believed rebecca to be the meekest creature in the world so admirably on the occasions when her father brought her to chiswick used rebecca to perform the part of the ingenue and only a year before the arrangement by which rebecca had been admitted into her house and when rebecca was sixteen years old miss pinkerton majestically and with a little speech made her a present of a doll which was by the way the confiscated property of miss swindle discovered surreptitiously nursing it in school hours how the father and daughter laughed as they trudged home together after the evening party it was on the occasion of the speeches when all the professors were invited and how miss pinkerton would have raged had she seen the caricature of herself which the little mimic rebecca managed to make out of her doll becky used to go through dialogues with it it formed the delight of newman street gerrard street and the artists quarter and the young painters when they came to take their gin and water with their lazy dissolute clever jovial senior used regularly to ask rebecca if miss pinkerton was at home she was as well known to them poor soul as mr lawrence or president west once rebecca had the honour to pass a few days at chiswick after which she brought back jemima and erected another doll as miss jemmy for though that honest creature had made and given her jelly and cake enough for three children and a seven shilling piece at parting the girl's sense of ridicule was far stronger than her gratitude and she sacrificed miss jemmy quite as pitilessly as her sister the catastrophe came and she was brought to the mall as to her home the rigid formality of the place suffocated her the prayers and the meals the lessons and the walks which were arranged with a conventual regularity oppressed her almost beyond endurance and she looked back to the freedom and the beggary of the old studio in soho with so much regret that everybody herself included fancied she was consumed with grief for her father she had a little room in the garret where the maids heard her walking and sobbing at night but it was with rage and not with grief she had not been much of a dissembler until now her loneliness taught her to feign she had never mingled in the society of women her father reprobate as he was was a man of talent his conversation was a thousand times more agreeable to her than the talk of such of her own sex as she now encountered the pompous vanity of the old schoolmistress the foolish good humour of her sister the silly chat and scandal of the elder girls and the frigid correctness of the governesses equally annoyed her and she had no soft maternal heart this unlucky girl otherwise the prattle and talk of the younger children with whose care she was chiefly intrusted might have soothed and interested her but she lived among them two years and not one was sorry that she went away the gentle tender hearted amelia sedley was the only person to whom she could attach herself in the least and who could help attaching herself to amelia the happiness the superior advantages of the young women round about her gave rebecca inexpressible pangs of envy what airs that girl gives herself because she is an earl's grand daughter she said of one how they cringe and bow to that creole because of her hundred thousand pounds i am a thousand times cleverer and more charming than that creature for all her wealth i am as well bred as the earl's grand daughter for all her fine pedigree and yet every one passes me by here and yet when i was at my father's did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me she determined at any rate to get free from the prison in which she found herself and now began to act for herself and for the first time to make connected plans for the future she took advantage therefore of the means of study the place offered her and as she was already a musician and a good linguist she speedily went through the little course of study which was considered necessary for ladies in those days her music she practised incessantly and one day when the girls were out and she had remained at home she was overheard to play a piece so well that minerva thought wisely she could spare herself the expense of a master for the juniors and intimated to miss sharp that she was to instruct them in music for the future the girl refused and for the first time and to the astonishment of the majestic mistress of the school i am here to speak french with the children rebecca said abruptly not to teach them music and save money for you give me money and i will teach them minerva was obliged to yield and of course disliked her from that day for five and thirty years she said and with great justice i never have seen the individual who has dared in my own house to question my authority i have nourished a viper in my bosom a viper a fiddlestick said miss sharp to the old lady almost fainting with astonishment you took me because i was useful there is no question of gratitude between us i hate this place and want to leave it i will do nothing here but what i am obliged to do it was in vain that the old lady asked her if she was aware she was speaking to miss pinkerton rebecca laughed in her face with a horrid sarcastic demoniacal laughter that almost sent the schoolmistress into fits give me a sum of money said the girl and get rid of me or if you like better get me a good place as governess in a nobleman's family you can do so if you please and in their further disputes she always returned to this point get me a situation we hate each other and i am ready to go worthy miss pinkerton although she had a roman nose and a turban and was as tall as a grenadier and had been up to this time an irresistible princess had no will or strength like that of her little apprentice and in vain did battle against her and tried to overawe her attempting once to scold her in public rebecca hit upon the before mentioned plan of answering her in french which quite routed the old woman in order to maintain authority in her school it became necessary to remove this rebel this monster this serpent this firebrand and hearing about this time that sir pitt crawley's family was in want of a governess she actually recommended miss sharp for the situation firebrand and serpent as she was i cannot certainly she said find fault with miss sharp's conduct except to myself and must allow that her talents and accomplishments are of a high order as far as the head goes at least she does credit to the educational system pursued at my establishment and so the schoolmistress reconciled the recommendation to her conscience and the indentures were cancelled and the apprentice was free the battle here described in a few lines of course lasted for some months and as miss sedley being now in her seventeenth year was about to leave school and had a friendship for miss sharp tis the only point in amelia's behaviour said minerva which has not been satisfactory to her mistress miss sharp was invited by her friend to pass a week with her at home before she entered upon her duties as governess in a private family thus the world began for these two young ladies for amelia it was quite a new fresh brilliant world with all the bloom upon it it was not quite a new one for rebecca indeed if the truth must be told with respect to the crisp affair the tart woman hinted to somebody who took an affidavit of the fact to somebody else that there was a great deal more than was made public regarding mr crisp and miss sharp and that his letter was in answer to another letter but who can tell you the real truth of the matter at all events if rebecca was not beginning the world she was beginning it over again by the time the young ladies reached kensington turnpike amelia had not forgotten her companions but had dried her tears and had blushed very much and been delighted at a young officer of the life guards who spied her as he was riding by and said a dem fine gal egad and before the carriage arrived in russell square a great deal of conversation had taken place about the drawing room and whether or not young ladies wore powder as well as hoops when presented and whether she was to have that honour to the lord mayor's ball she knew she was to go and when at length home was reached miss amelia sedley skipped out on sambo's arm as happy and as handsome a girl as any in the whole big city of london both he and coachman agreed on this point and so did her father and mother and so did every one of the servants in the house as they stood bobbing and curtseying and smiling in the hall to welcome their young mistress you may be sure that she showed rebecca over every room of the house and everything in every one of her drawers and her books and her piano and her dresses and all her necklaces brooches laces and gimcracks she insisted upon rebecca accepting the white cornelian and the turquoise rings and a sweet sprigged muslin which was too small for her now though it would fit her friend to a nicety and she determined in her heart to ask her mother's permission to present her white cashmere shawl to her friend could she not spare it and had not her brother joseph just brought her two from india when rebecca saw the two magnificent cashmere shawls which joseph sedley had brought home to his sister she said with perfect truth that it must be delightful to have a brother and easily got the pity of the tender hearted amelia for being alone in the world an orphan without friends or kindred not alone said amelia you know rebecca i shall always be your friend and love you as a sister indeed i will ah but to have parents as you have kind rich affectionate parents who give you everything you ask for and their love which is more precious than all my poor papa could give me nothing and i had but two frocks in all the world and then to have a brother a dear brother oh how you must love him amelia laughed what don't you love him you who say you love everybody yes of course i do only only what only joseph doesn't seem to care much whether i love him or not he gave me two fingers to shake when he arrived after ten years absence he is very kind and good but he scarcely ever speaks to me i think he loves his pipe a great deal better than his but here amelia checked herself for why should she speak ill of her brother he was very kind to me as a child she added i was but five years old when he went away isn't he very rich said rebecca they say all indian nabobs are enormously rich i believe he has a very large income and is your sister in law a nice pretty woman la joseph is not married said amelia laughing again perhaps she had mentioned the fact already to rebecca but that young lady did not appear to have remembered it indeed vowed and protested that she expected to see a number of amelia's nephews and nieces she was quite disappointed that mr sedley was not married she was sure amelia had said he was and she doted so on little children i think you must have had enough of them at chiswick said amelia rather wondering at the sudden tenderness on her friend's part and indeed in later days miss sharp would never have committed herself so far as to advance opinions the untruth of which would have been so easily detected but we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet unused to the art of deceiving poor innocent creature and making her own experience in her own person the meaning of the above series of queries as translated in the heart of this ingenious young woman was simply this if mr joseph sedley is rich and unmarried why should i not marry him i have only a fortnight to be sure but there is no harm in trying and she determined within herself to make this laudable attempt she redoubled her caresses to amelia she kissed the white cornelian necklace as she put it on and vowed she would never never part with it when the dinner bell rang she went downstairs with her arm round her friend's waist as is the habit of young ladies she was so agitated at the drawing room door that she could hardly find courage to enter feel my heart how it beats dear said she to her friend no it doesn't said amelia come in don't be frightened papa won't do you any harm chapter iii rebecca is in presence of the enemy a very stout puffy man in buckskins and hessian boots with several immense neckcloths that rose almost to his nose with a red striped waistcoat and an apple green coat with steel buttons almost as large as crown pieces it was the morning costume of a dandy or blood of those days was reading the paper by the fire when the two girls entered and bounced off his arm chair and blushed excessively and hid his entire face almost in his neckcloths at this apparition it's only your sister joseph said amelia laughing and shaking the two fingers which he held out i've come home for good you know and this is my friend miss sharp whom you have heard me mention no never upon my word said the head under the neckcloth shaking very much that is yes what abominably cold weather miss and herewith he fell to poking the fire with all his might although it was in the middle of june he's very handsome whispered rebecca to amelia rather loud do you think so said the latter i'll tell him darling not for worlds said miss sharp starting back as timid as a fawn she had previously made a respectful virgin like curtsey to the gentleman and her modest eyes gazed so perseveringly on the carpet that it was a wonder how she should have found an opportunity to see him thank you for the beautiful shawls brother said amelia to the fire poker are they not beautiful rebecca o heavenly said miss sharp and her eyes went from the carpet straight to the chandelier joseph still continued a huge clattering at the poker and tongs puffing and blowing the while and turning as red as his yellow face would allow him i can't make you such handsome presents joseph continued his sister but while i was at school i have embroidered for you a very beautiful pair of braces good gad amelia cried the brother in serious alarm what do you mean and plunging with all his might at the bell rope that article of furniture came away in his hand and increased the honest fellow's confusion for heaven's sake see if my buggy's at the door i can't wait i must go d that groom of mine i must go at this minute the father of the family walked in rattling his seals like a true british merchant what's the matter emmy says he joseph wants me to see if his his buggy is at the door what is a buggy papa it is a one horse palanquin said the old gentleman who was a wag in his way joseph at this burst out into a wild fit of laughter in which encountering the eye of miss sharp he stopped all of a sudden as if he had been shot this young lady is your friend miss sharp i am very happy to see you have you and emmy been quarrelling already with joseph that he wants to be off i promised bonamy of our service sir said joseph to dine with him o fie didn't you tell your mother you would dine here but in this dress it's impossible look at him isn't he handsome enough to dine anywhere miss sharp on which of course miss sharp looked at her friend and they both set off in a fit of laughter highly agreeable to the old gentleman did you ever see a pair of buckskins like those at miss pinkerton's continued he following up his advantage gracious heavens father cried joseph there now i have hurt his feelings mrs sedley my dear i have hurt your son's feelings i have alluded to his buckskins ask miss sharp if i haven't come joseph be friends with miss sharp and let us all go to dinner there's a pillau joseph just as you like it and papa has brought home the best turbot in billingsgate come come sir walk downstairs with miss sharp and i will follow with these two young women said the father and he took an arm of wife and daughter and walked merrily off if miss rebecca sharp had determined in her heart upon making the conquest of this big beau i don't think ladies we have any right to blame her for though the task of husband hunting is generally and with becoming modesty entrusted by young persons to their mammas recollect that miss sharp had no kind parent to arrange these delicate matters for her and that if she did not get a husband for herself there was no one else in the wide world who would take the trouble off her hands what causes young people to come out but the noble ambition of matrimony what sends them trooping to watering places what keeps them dancing till five o'clock in the morning through a whole mortal season what causes them to labour at pianoforte sonatas and to learn four songs from a fashionable master at a guinea a lesson and to play the harp if they have handsome arms and neat elbows and to wear lincoln green toxophilite hats and feathers but that they may bring down some desirable young man with those killing bows and arrows of theirs what causes respectable parents to take up their carpets set their houses topsy turvy and spend a fifth of their year's income in ball suppers and iced champagne is it sheer love of their species and an unadulterated wish to see young people happy and dancing psha they want to marry their daughters and as honest mrs sedley has in the depths of her kind heart already arranged a score of little schemes for the settlement of her amelia so also had our beloved but unprotected rebecca determined to do her very best to secure the husband who was even more necessary for her than for her friend she had a vivid imagination she had besides read the arabian nights and guthrie's geography and it is a fact that while she was dressing for dinner and after she had asked amelia whether her brother was very rich she had built for herself a most magnificent castle in the air of which she was mistress with a husband somewhere in the background she had not seen him as yet and his figure would not therefore be very distinct she had arrayed herself in an infinity of shawls turbans and diamond necklaces and had mounted upon an elephant to the sound of the march in bluebeard in order to pay a visit of ceremony to the grand mogul charming alnaschar visions it is the happy privilege of youth to construct you and many a fanciful young creature besides rebecca sharp has indulged in these delightful day dreams ere now joseph sedley was twelve years older than his sister amelia he was in the east india company's civil service and his name appeared at the period of which we write in the bengal division of the east india register as collector of boggley wollah an honourable and lucrative post as everybody knows in order to know to what higher posts joseph rose in the service the reader is referred to the same periodical boggley wollah is situated in a fine lonely marshy jungly district famous for snipe shooting and where not unfrequently you may flush a tiger ramgunge where there is a magistrate is only forty miles off and there is a cavalry station about thirty miles farther so joseph wrote home to his parents when he took possession of his collectorship he had lived for about eight years of his life quite alone at this charming place scarcely seeing a christian face except twice a year when the detachment arrived to carry off the revenues which he had collected to calcutta luckily at this time he caught a liver complaint for the cure of which he returned to europe and which was the source of great comfort and amusement to him in his native country he did not live with his family while in london but had lodgings of his own like a gay young bachelor before he went to india he was too young to partake of the delightful pleasures of a man about town and plunged into them on his return with considerable assiduity he drove his horses in the park he dined at the fashionable taverns for the oriental club was not as yet invented he frequented the theatres as the mode was in those days or made his appearance at the opera laboriously attired in tights and a cocked hat on returning to india and ever after he used to talk of the pleasure of this period of his existence with great enthusiasm and give you to understand that he and brummel were the leading bucks of the day but he was as lonely here as in his jungle at boggley wollah he scarcely knew a single soul in the metropolis and were it not for his doctor and the society of his blue pill and his liver complaint he must have died of loneliness he was lazy peevish and a bon vivant the appearance of a lady frightened him beyond measure hence it was but seldom that he joined the paternal circle in russell square where there was plenty of gaiety and where the jokes of his good natured old father frightened his amour propre his bulk caused joseph much anxious thought and alarm now and then he would make a desperate attempt to get rid of his superabundant fat but his indolence and love of good living speedily got the better of these endeavours at reform and he found himself again at his three meals a day he never was well dressed but he took the hugest pains to adorn his big person and passed many hours daily in that occupation his valet made a fortune out of his wardrobe his toilet table was covered with as many pomatums and essences as ever were employed by an old beauty he had tried in order to give himself a waist every girth stay and waistband then invented like most fat men he would have his clothes made too tight and took care they should be of the most brilliant colours and youthful cut when dressed at length in the afternoon he would issue forth to take a drive with nobody in the park and then would come back in order to dress again and go and dine with nobody at the piazza coffee house he was as vain as a girl and perhaps his extreme shyness was one of the results of his extreme vanity if miss rebecca can get the better of him and at her first entrance into life she is a young person of no ordinary cleverness the first move showed considerable skill when she called sedley a very handsome man she knew that amelia would tell her mother who would probably tell joseph or who at any rate would be pleased by the compliment paid to her son all mothers are if you had told sycorax that her son caliban was as handsome as apollo she would have been pleased witch as she was perhaps too joseph sedley would overhear the compliment rebecca spoke loud enough and he did hear and thinking in his heart that he was a very fine man the praise thrilled through every fibre of his big body and made it tingle with pleasure then however came a recoil is the girl making fun of me he thought and straightway he bounced towards the bell and was for retreating as we have seen when his father's jokes and his mother's entreaties caused him to pause and stay where he was he conducted the young lady down to dinner in a dubious and agitated frame of mind does she really think i am handsome thought he or is she only making game of me we have talked of joseph sedley being as vain as a girl heaven help us the girls have only to turn the tables and say of one of their own sex she is as vain as a man and they will have perfect reason the bearded creatures are quite as eager for praise quite as finikin over their toilettes quite as proud of their personal advantages quite as conscious of their powers of fascination as any coquette in the world downstairs then they went joseph very red and blushing rebecca very modest and holding her green eyes downwards she was dressed in white with bare shoulders as white as snow the picture of youth unprotected innocence and humble virgin simplicity i must be very quiet thought rebecca and very much interested about india now we have heard how mrs sedley had prepared a fine curry for her son just as he liked it and in the course of dinner a portion of this dish was offered to rebecca what is it said she turning an appealing look to mr joseph capital said he his mouth was full of it his face quite red with the delightful exercise of gobbling mother it's as good as my own curries in india oh i must try some if it is an indian dish said miss rebecca i am sure everything must be good that comes from there give miss sharp some curry my dear said mr sedley laughing rebecca had never tasted the dish before do you find it as good as"
