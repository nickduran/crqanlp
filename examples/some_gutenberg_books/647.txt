"1" "and looked up and down as though in pain or indecision then with a lovely change of countenance and laying her gloved hand upon his arm what you already think of me she said i tremble to conceive yet i must here condemn myself still further here i must leave you and here i beseech you to wait for my return do not attempt to follow me or spy upon my actions suspend yet awhile your judgment of a girl as innocent as your own sister and do not above all desert me stranger as you are i have none else to look to you see me in sorrow and great fear you are a gentleman courteous and kind and when i beg for a few minutes patience i make sure beforehand you will not deny me challoner grudgingly promised and the young lady with a grateful eye shot vanished round the corner but the force of her appeal had been a little blunted for the young man was not only destitute of sisters but of any female relative nearer than a great aunt in wales now he was alone besides the spell that he had hitherto obeyed began to weaken he considered his behaviour with a sneer and plucking up the spirit of revolt he started in pursuit the reader if he has ever plied the fascinating trade of the noctambulist will not be unaware that in the neighbourhood of the great railway centres certain early taverns inaugurate the business of the day it was into one of these that challoner coming round the corner of the block beheld his charming companion disappear to say he was surprised were inexact for he had long since left that sentiment behind him acute disgust and disappointment seized upon his soul and with silent oaths he damned this commonplace enchantress she had scarce been gone a second ere the swing doors reopened and she appeared again in company with a young man of mean and slouching attire for some five or six exchanges they conversed together with an animated air then the fellow shouldered again into the tap and the young lady with something swifter than a walk retraced her steps towards challoner he saw her coming a miracle of grace her ankle as she hurried flashing from her dress her movements eloquent of speed and youth and though he still entertained some thoughts of flight they grew miserably fainter as the distance lessened against mere beauty he was proof it was her unmistakable gentility that now robbed him of the courage of his cowardice with a proved adventuress he had acted strictly on his right with one who in spite of all he could not quite deny to be a lady he found himself disarmed at the very corner from whence he had spied upon her interview she came upon him still transfixed and ah she cried with a bright flush of colour ah ungenerous the sharpness of the attack somewhat restored the squire of dames to the possession of himself madam he returned with a fair show of stoutness i do not think that hitherto you can complain of any lack of generosity i have suffered myself to be led over a considerable portion of the metropolis and if i now request you to discharge me of my office of protector you have friends at hand who will be glad of the succession she stood a moment dumb it is well she said go go and may god help me you have seen me me an innocent girl fleeing from a dire catastrophe and haunted by sinister men and neither pity curiosity nor honour move you to await my explanation or to help in my distress go she repeated i am lost indeed and with a passionate gesture she turned and fled along the street challoner observed her retreat and disappear an almost intolerable sense of guilt contending with the profound sense that he was being gulled she was no sooner gone than the first of these feelings took the upper hand he felt if he had done her less than justice that his conduct was a perfect model of the ungracious the cultured tone of her voice her choice of language and the elegant decorum of her movements cried out aloud against a harsh construction and between penitence and curiosity he began slowly to follow in her wake at the corner he had her once more full in view her speed was failing like a stricken bird's even as he looked she threw her arm out gropingly and fell and leaned against the wall at the spectacle challoner's fortitude gave way in a few strides he overtook her and for the first time removing his hat assured her in the most moving terms of his entire respect and firm desire to help her he spoke at first unheeded but gradually it appeared that she began to comprehend his words she moved a little and drew herself upright and finally as with a sudden movement of forgiveness turned on the young man a countenance in which reproach and gratitude were mingled ah madam he cried use me as you will and once more but now with a great air of deference he offered her the conduct of his arm she took it with a sigh that struck him to the heart and they began once more to trace the deserted streets but now her steps as though exhausted by emotion began to linger on the way she leaned the more heavily upon his arm and he like the parent bird stooped fondly above his drooping convoy her physical distress was not accompanied by any failing of her spirits and hearing her strike so soon into a playful and charming vein of talk challoner could not sufficiently admire the elasticity of his companion's nature let me forget she had said for one half hour let me forget and sure enough with the very word her sorrows appeared to be forgotten before every house she paused invented a name for the proprietor and sketched his character here lived the old general whom she was to marry on the fifth of the next month there was the mansion of the rich widow who had set her heart on challoner and though she still hung wearily on the young man's arm her laughter sounded low and pleasant in his ears ah she sighed by way of commentary in such a life as mine i must seize tight hold of any happiness that i can find when they arrived in this leisurely manner at the head of grosvenor place the gates of the park were opening and the bedraggled company of night walkers were being at last admitted into that paradise of lawns challoner and his companion followed the movement and walked for awhile in silence in that tatterdemalion crowd but as one after another weary with the night's patrolling of the city pavement sank upon the benches or wandered into separate paths the vast extent of the park had soon utterly swallowed up the last of these intruders and the pair proceeded on their way alone in the grateful quiet of the morning presently they came in sight of a bench standing very open on a mound of turf the young lady looked about her with relief here she said here at last we are secure from listeners here then you shall learn and judge my history i could not bear that we should part and that you should still suppose your kindness squandered upon one who was unworthy thereupon she sat down upon the bench and motioning challoner to take a place immediately beside her began in the following words and with the greatest appearance of enjoyment to narrate the story of her life _story of the destroying angel_ my father was a native of england son of a cadet of a great ancient but untitled family and by some event fault or misfortune he was driven to flee from the land of his birth and to lay aside the name of his ancestors he sought the states and instead of lingering in effeminate cities pushed at once into the far west with an exploring party of frontiersmen he was no ordinary traveller for he was not only brave and impetuous by character but learned in many sciences and above all in botany which he particularly loved thus it fell that before many months fremont himself the nominal leader of the troop courted and bowed to his opinion they had pushed as i have said into the still unknown regions of the west for some time they followed the track of mormon caravans guiding themselves in that vast and melancholy desert by the skeletons of men and animals then they inclined their route a little to the north and losing even these dire memorials came into a country of forbidding stillness i have often heard my father dwell upon the features of that ride rock cliff and barren moor alternated the streams were very far between and neither beast nor bird disturbed the solitude on the fortieth day they had already run so short of food that it was judged advisable to call a halt and scatter upon all sides to hunt a great fire was built that its smoke might serve to rally them and each man of the party mounted and struck off at a venture into the surrounding desert my father rode for many hours with a steep range of cliffs upon the one hand very black and horrible and upon the other an unwatered vale dotted with boulders like the site of some subverted city at length he found the slot of a great animal and from the claw marks and the hair among the brush judged that he was on the track of a cinnamon bear of most unusual size he quickened the pace of his steed and still following the quarry came at last to the division of two watersheds on the far side the country was exceeding intricate and difficult heaped with boulders and dotted here and there with a few pines which seemed to indicate the neighbourhood of water here then he picketed his horse and relying on his trusty rifle advanced alone into that wilderness presently in the great silence that reigned he was aware of the sound of running water to his right and leaning in that direction was rewarded by a scene of natural wonder and human pathos strangely intermixed the stream ran at the bottom of a narrow and winding passage whose wall like sides of rock were sometimes for miles together unscalable by man the water when the stream was swelled with rains must have filled it from side to side the sun's rays only plumbed it in the hour of noon the wind in that narrow and damp funnel blew tempestuously and yet in the bottom of this den immediately below my father's eyes as he leaned over the margin of the cliff a party of some half a hundred men women and children lay scattered uneasily among the rocks they lay some upon their backs some prone and not one stirring their upturned faces seemed all of an extraordinary paleness and emaciation and from time to time above the washing of the stream a faint sound of moaning mounted to my father's ears while he thus looked an old man got staggering to his feet unwound his blanket and laid it with great gentleness on a young girl who sat hard by propped against a rock the girl did not seem to be conscious of the act and the old man after having looked upon her with the most engaging pity returned to his former bed and lay down again uncovered on the turf but the scene had not passed without observation even in that starving camp from the very outskirts of the party a man with a white beard and seemingly of venerable years rose upon his knees and came crawling stealthily among the sleepers towards the girl and judge of my father's indignation when he beheld this cowardly miscreant strip from her both the coverings and return with them to his original position here he lay down for a while below his spoils and as my father imagined feigned to be asleep but presently he had raised himself again upon one elbow looked with sharp scrutiny at his companions and then swiftly carried his hand into his bosom and thence to his mouth by the movement of his jaws he must be eating in that camp of famine he had reserved a store of nourishment and while his companions lay in the stupor of approaching death secretly restored his powers my father was so incensed at what he saw that he raised his rifle and but for an accident he has often declared he would have shot the fellow dead upon the spot how different would then have been my history but it was not to be even as he raised the barrel his eye lighted on the bear as it crawled along a ledge some way below him and ceding to the hunters instinct it was at the brute not at the man that he discharged his piece the bear leaped and fell into a pool of the river the canyon re echoed the report and in a moment the camp was afoot with cries that were scarce human stumbling falling and throwing each other down these starving people rushed upon the quarry and before my father climbing down by the ledge had time to reach the level of the stream many were already satisfying their hunger on the raw flesh and a fire was being built by the more dainty his arrival was for some time unremarked he stood in the midst of these tottering and clay faced marionettes he was surrounded by their cries but their whole soul was fixed on the dead carcass even those who were too weak to move lay half turned over with their eyes riveted upon the bear and my father seeing himself stand as though invisible in the thick of this dreary hubbub was seized with a desire to weep a touch upon the arm restrained him turning about he found himself face to face with the old man he had so nearly killed and yet at the second glance recognised him for no old man at all but one in the full strength of his years and of a strong speaking and intellectual countenance stigmatised by weariness and famine he beckoned my father near the cliff and there in the most private whisper begged for brandy my father looked at him with scorn you remind me he said of a neglected duty here is my flask it contains enough i trust to revive the women of your party and i will begin with her whom i saw you robbing of her blankets and with that not heeding his appeals my father turned his back upon the egoist the girl still lay reclined against the rock she lay too far sunk in the first stage of death to have observed the bustle round her couch but when my father had raised her head put the flask to her lips and forced or aided her to swallow some drops of the restorative she opened her languid eyes and smiled upon him faintly never was there a smile of a more touching sweetness never were eyes more deeply violet more honestly eloquent of the soul i speak with knowledge for these were the same eyes that smiled upon me in the cradle from her who was to be his wife my father still jealously watched and followed by the man with the grey beard carried his attentions to all the women of the party and gave the last drainings of his flask to those among the men who seemed in the most need is there none left not a drop for me said the man with the beard not one drop replied my father and if you find yourself in want let me counsel you to put your hand into the pocket of your coat ah cried the other you misjudge me you think me one who clings to life for selfish and commonplace considerations but let me tell you that were all this caravan to perish the world would but be lightened of a weight these are but human insects pullulating thick as may flies in the slums of european cities whom i myself have plucked from degradation and misery from the dung heap and gin palace door and you compare their lives with mine you are then a mormon missionary asked my father oh cried the man with a strange smile a mormon missionary if you will i value not the title were i no more than that i could have died without a murmur but with my life as a physician is bound up the knowledge of great secrets and the future of man this it was when we missed the caravan tried for a short cut and wandered to this desolate ravine that ate into my soul and in five days has changed my beard from ebony to silver and you are a physician mused my father looking on his face bound by oath to succour man in his distresses sir returned the mormon my name is grierson you will hear that name again and you will then understand that my duty was not to this caravan of paupers but to mankind at large my father turned to the remainder of the party who were now sufficiently revived to hear told them that he would set off at once to bring help from his own party and he added if you be again reduced to such extremities look round you and you will see the earth strewn with assistance here for instance growing on the under side of fissures in this cliff you will perceive a yellow moss trust me it is both edible and excellent ha said doctor grierson you know botany not i alone returned my father lowering his voice for see where these have been scraped away am i right was that your secret store my father's comrades he found when he returned to the signal fire had made a good day's hunting they were thus the more easily persuaded to extend assistance to the mormon caravan and the next day beheld both parties on the march for the frontiers of utah the distance to be traversed was not great but the nature of the country and the difficulty of procuring food extended the time to nearly three weeks and my father had thus ample leisure to know and appreciate the girl whom he had succoured i will call my mother lucy her family name i am not at liberty to mention it is one you would know well by what series of undeserved calamities this innocent flower of maidenhood lovely refined by education ennobled by the finest taste was thus cast among the horrors of a mormon caravan i must not stay to tell you let it suffice that even in these untoward circumstances she found a heart worthy of her own the ardour of attachment which united my father and mother was perhaps partly due to the strange manner of their meeting it knew at least no bounds either divine or human my father for her sake determined to renounce his ambitions and abjure his faith and a week had not yet passed upon the march before he had resigned from his party accepted the mormon doctrine and received the promise of my mother's hand on the arrival of the party at salt lake the marriage took place and i was its only offspring my father prospered exceedingly in his affairs remained faithful to my mother and though you may wonder to hear it i believe there were few happier homes in any country than that in which i saw the light and grew to girlhood we were indeed and in spite of all our wealth avoided as heretics and half believers by the more precise and pious of the faithful young himself that formidable tyrant was known to look askance upon my father's riches but of this i had no guess i dwelt indeed under the mormon system with perfect innocence and faith some of our friends had many wives but such was the custom and why should it surprise me more than marriage itself from time to time one of our rich acquaintances would disappear his family be broken up his wives and houses shared among the elders of the church and his memory only recalled with bated breath and dreadful headshakings when i had been very still and my presence perhaps was forgotten some such topic would arise among my elders by the evening fire i would see them draw the closer together and look behind them with scared eyes and i might gather from their whisperings how some one rich honoured healthy and in the prime of his days some one perhaps who had taken me on his knees a week before had in one hour been spirited from home and family and vanished like an image from a mirror leaving not a print behind it was terrible indeed but so was death the universal law and even if the talk should wax still bolder full of ominous silences and nods and i should hear named in a whisper the destroying angels how was a child to understand these mysteries i heard of a destroying angel as some more happy child might hear in england of a bishop or a rural dean with vague respect and without the wish for further information life anywhere in society as in nature rests upon dread foundations i beheld safe roads a garden blooming in the desert pious people crowding to worship i was aware of my parents tenderness and all the harmless luxuries of my existence and why should i pry beneath this honest seeming surface for the mysteries on which it stood we dwelt originally in the city but at an early date we moved to a beautiful house in a green dingle musical with splashing water and surrounded on almost every side by twenty miles of poisonous and rocky desert the city was thirty miles away there was but one road which went no further than my father's door the rest were bridle tracks impassable in winter and we thus dwelt in a solitude inconceivable to the european our only neighbour was dr grierson to my young eyes after the hair oiled chin bearded elders of the city and the ill favoured and mentally stunted women of their harems there was something agreeable in the correct manner the fine bearing the thin white hair and beard and the piercing looks of the old doctor yet though he was almost our only visitor i never wholly overcame a sense of fear in his presence and this disquietude was rather fed by the awful solitude in which he lived and the obscurity that hung about his occupations his house was but a mile or two from ours but very differently placed it stood overlooking the road on the summit of a steep slope and planted close against a range of overhanging bluffs nature you would say had here desired to imitate the works of man for the slope was even like the glacis of a fort and the cliffs of a constant height like the ramparts of a city not even spring could change one feature of that desolate scene and the windows looked down across a plain snowy with alkali to ranges of cold stone sierras on the north twice or thrice i remember passing within view of this forbidding residence and seeing it always shuttered smokeless and deserted i remarked to my parents that some day it would certainly be robbed ah no said my father never robbed and i observed a strange conviction in his tone at last and not long before the blow fell on my unhappy family i chanced to see the doctor's house in a new light my father was ill my mother confined to his bedside and i was suffered to go under the charge of our driver to the lonely house some twenty miles away where our packages were left for us the horse cast a shoe night overtook us halfway home and it was well on for three in the morning when the driver and i alone in a light waggon came to that part of the road which ran below the doctor's house the moon swam clear the cliffs and mountains in this strong light lay utterly deserted but the house from its station on the top of the long slope and close under the bluff not only shone abroad from every window like a place of festival but from the great chimney at the west end poured forth a coil of smoke so thick and so voluminous that it hung for miles along the windless night air and its shadow lay far abroad in the moonlight upon the glittering alkali as we continued to draw near besides a regular and panting throb began to divide the silence first it seemed to me like the beating of a heart and next it put into my mind the thought of some giant smothered under mountains and still with incalculable effort fetching breath i had heard of the railway though i had not seen it and i turned to ask the driver if this resembled it but some look in his eye some pallor whether of fear or moonlight on his face caused the words to die upon my lips we continued therefore to advance in silence till we were close below the lighted house when suddenly without one premonitory rustle there burst forth a report of such a bigness that it shook the earth and set the echoes of the mountains thundering from cliff to cliff a pillar of amber flame leaped from the chimney top and fell in multitudes of sparks and at the same time the lights in the windows turned for one instant ruby red and then expired the driver had checked his horse instinctively and the echoes were still rumbling farther off among the mountains when there broke from the now darkened interior a series of yells whether of man or woman it was impossible to guess the door flew open and there ran forth into the moonlight at the top of the long slope a figure clad in white which began to dance and leap and throw itself down and roll as if in agony before the house i could no more restrain my cries the driver laid his lash about the horse's flank and we fled up the rough track at the peril of our lives and did not draw rein till turning the corner of the mountain we beheld my father's ranch and deep green groves and gardens sleeping in the tranquil light this was the one adventure of my life until my father had climbed to the very topmost point of material prosperity and i myself had reached the age of seventeen i was still innocent and merry like a child tended my garden or ran upon the hills in glad simplicity gave not a thought to coquetry or to material cares and if my eye rested on my own image in a mirror or some sylvan spring it was to seek and recognise the features of my parents but the fears which had long pressed on others were now to be laid on my youth i had thrown myself one sultry cloudy afternoon on a divan the windows stood open on the verandah where my mother sat with her embroidery and when my father joined her from the garden their conversation clearly audible to me was of so startling a nature that it held me enthralled where i lay the blow has come my father said after a long pause i could hear my mother start and turn but in words she made no reply yes continued my father i have received to day a list of all that i possess of all i say of what i have lent privately to men whose lips are sealed with terror of what i have buried with my own hand on the bare mountain when there was not a bird in heaven does the air then carry secrets are the hills of glass do the stones we tread upon preserve the footprint to betray us oh lucy lucy that we should have come to such a country but this returned my mother is no very new or very threatening event you are accused of some concealment you will pay more taxes in the future and be mulcted in a fine it is disquieting indeed to find our acts so spied upon and the most private known but is this new have we not long feared and suspected every blade of grass ay and our shadows cried my father but all this is nothing here is the letter that accompanied the list i heard my mother turn the pages and she was some time silent i see she said at last and then with the tone of one reading from a believer so largely blessed by providence with this world's goods she continued the church awaits in confidence some signal mark of piety there lies the sting am i not right these are the words you fear these are the words replied my father lucy you remember priestley two days before he disappeared he carried"
