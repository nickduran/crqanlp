"1" "that's all i can do the men won't stand for any more and if we don't get ye landed pretty quick they may even change their minds about giving ye that much show i'll put all yer stuff ashore with ye as well as cookin utensils an some old sails for tents an enough grub to last ye until ye can find fruit and game with yer guns for protection ye ought to be able to live here easy enough until help comes when i get safely hid away i'll see to it that the british gover'ment learns about where ye be for the life of me i couldn't tell em exactly where for i don't know myself but they'll find ye all right after he had left them they went silently below each wrapped in gloomy forebodings clayton did not believe that black michael had the slightest intention of notifying the british government of their whereabouts nor was he any too sure but that some treachery was contemplated for the following day when they should be on shore with the sailors who would have to accompany them with their belongings once out of black michael's sight any of the men might strike them down and still leave black michael's conscience clear and even should they escape that fate was it not but to be faced with far graver dangers alone he might hope to survive for years for he was a strong athletic man but what of alice and that other little life so soon to be launched amidst the hardships and grave dangers of a primeval world the man shuddered as he meditated upon the awful gravity the fearful helplessness of their situation but it was a merciful providence which prevented him from foreseeing the hideous reality which awaited them in the grim depths of that gloomy wood early next morning their numerous chests and boxes were hoisted on deck and lowered to waiting small boats for transportation to shore there was a great quantity and variety of stuff as the claytons had expected a possible five to eight years residence in their new home thus in addition to the many necessities they had brought there were also many luxuries black michael was determined that nothing belonging to the claytons should be left on board whether out of compassion for them or in furtherance of his own self interests it would be difficult to say there was no question but that the presence of property of a missing british official upon a suspicious vessel would have been a difficult thing to explain in any civilized port in the world so zealous was he in his efforts to carry out his intentions that he insisted upon the return of clayton's revolvers to him by the sailors in whose possession they were into the small boats were also loaded salt meats and biscuit with a small supply of potatoes and beans matches and cooking vessels a chest of tools and the old sails which black michael had promised them as though himself fearing the very thing which clayton had suspected black michael accompanied them to shore and was the last to leave them when the small boats having filled the ship's casks with fresh water were pushed out toward the waiting fuwalda as the boats moved slowly over the smooth waters of the bay clayton and his wife stood silently watching their departure in the breasts of both a feeling of impending disaster and utter hopelessness and behind them over the edge of a low ridge other eyes watched close set wicked eyes gleaming beneath shaggy brows as the fuwalda passed through the narrow entrance to the harbor and out of sight behind a projecting point lady alice threw her arms about clayton's neck and burst into uncontrolled sobs bravely had she faced the dangers of the mutiny with heroic fortitude she had looked into the terrible future but now that the horror of absolute solitude was upon them her overwrought nerves gave way and the reaction came he did not attempt to check her tears it were better that nature have her way in relieving these long pent emotions and it was many minutes before the girl little more than a child she was could again gain mastery of herself oh john she cried at last the horror of it what are we to do what are we to do there is but one thing to do alice and he spoke as quietly as though they were sitting in their snug living room at home and that is work work must be our salvation we must not give ourselves time to think for in that direction lies madness we must work and wait i am sure that relief will come and come quickly when once it is apparent that the fuwalda has been lost even though black michael does not keep his word to us but john if it were only you and i she sobbed we could endure it i know but yes dear he answered gently i have been thinking of that also but we must face it as we must face whatever comes bravely and with the utmost confidence in our ability to cope with circumstances whatever they may be hundreds of thousands of years ago our ancestors of the dim and distant past faced the same problems which we must face possibly in these same primeval forests that we are here today evidences their victory what they did may we not do and even better for are we not armed with ages of superior knowledge and have we not the means of protection defense and sustenance which science has given us but of which they were totally ignorant what they accomplished alice with instruments and weapons of stone and bone surely that may we accomplish also ah john i wish that i might be a man with a man's philosophy but i am but a woman seeing with my heart rather than my head and all that i can see is too horrible too unthinkable to put into words i only hope you are right john i will do my best to be a brave primeval woman a fit mate for the primeval man clayton's first thought was to arrange a sleeping shelter for the night something which might serve to protect them from prowling beasts of prey he opened the box containing his rifles and ammunition that they might both be armed against possible attack while at work and then together they sought a location for their first night's sleeping place a hundred yards from the beach was a little level spot fairly free of trees here they decided eventually to build a permanent house but for the time being they both thought it best to construct a little platform in the trees out of reach of the larger of the savage beasts in whose realm they were to this end clayton selected four trees which formed a rectangle about eight feet square and cutting long branches from other trees he constructed a framework around them about ten feet from the ground fastening the ends of the branches securely to the trees by means of rope a quantity of which black michael had furnished him from the hold of the fuwalda across this framework clayton placed other smaller branches quite close together this platform he paved with the huge fronds of elephant's ear which grew in profusion about them and over the fronds he laid a great sail folded into several thicknesses seven feet higher he constructed a similar though lighter platform to serve as roof and from the sides of this he suspended the balance of his sailcloth for walls when completed he had a rather snug little nest to which he carried their blankets and some of the lighter luggage it was now late in the afternoon and the balance of the daylight hours were devoted to the building of a rude ladder by means of which lady alice could mount to her new home all during the day the forest about them had been filled with excited birds of brilliant plumage and dancing chattering monkeys who watched these new arrivals and their wonderful nest building operations with every mark of keenest interest and fascination notwithstanding that both clayton and his wife kept a sharp lookout they saw nothing of larger animals though on two occasions they had seen their little simian neighbors come screaming and chattering from the near by ridge casting frightened glances back over their little shoulders and evincing as plainly as though by speech that they were fleeing some terrible thing which lay concealed there just before dusk clayton finished his ladder and filling a great basin with water from the near by stream the two mounted to the comparative safety of their aerial chamber as it was quite warm clayton had left the side curtains thrown back over the roof and as they sat like turks upon their blankets lady alice straining her eyes into the darkening shadows of the wood suddenly reached out and grasped clayton's arms john she whispered look what is it a man as clayton turned his eyes in the direction she indicated he saw silhouetted dimly against the shadows beyond a great figure standing upright upon the ridge for a moment it stood as though listening and then turned slowly and melted into the shadows of the jungle what is it john i do not know alice he answered gravely it is too dark to see so far and it may have been but a shadow cast by the rising moon no john if it was not a man it was some huge and grotesque mockery of man oh i am afraid he gathered her in his arms whispering words of courage and love into her ears soon after he lowered the curtain walls tying them securely to the trees so that except for a little opening toward the beach they were entirely enclosed as it was now pitch dark within their tiny aerie they lay down upon their blankets to try to gain through sleep a brief respite of forgetfulness clayton lay facing the opening at the front a rifle and a brace of revolvers at his hand scarcely had they closed their eyes than the terrifying cry of a panther rang out from the jungle behind them closer and closer it came until they could hear the great beast directly beneath them for an hour or more they heard it sniffing and clawing at the trees which supported their platform but at last it roamed away across the beach where clayton could see it clearly in the brilliant moonlight a great handsome beast the largest he had ever seen during the long hours of darkness they caught but fitful snatches of sleep for the night noises of a great jungle teeming with myriad animal life kept their overwrought nerves on edge so that a hundred times they were startled to wakefulness by piercing screams or the stealthy moving of great bodies beneath them chapter iii life and death morning found them but little if at all refreshed though it was with a feeling of intense relief that they saw the day dawn as soon as they had made their meager breakfast of salt pork coffee and biscuit clayton commenced work upon their house for he realized that they could hope for no safety and no peace of mind at night until four strong walls effectually barred the jungle life from them the task was an arduous one and required the better part of a month though he built but one small room he constructed his cabin of small logs about six inches in diameter stopping the chinks with clay which he found at the depth of a few feet beneath the surface soil at one end he built a fireplace of small stones from the beach these also he set in clay and when the house had been entirely completed he applied a coating of the clay to the entire outside surface to the thickness of four inches in the window opening he set small branches about an inch in diameter both vertically and horizontally and so woven that they formed a substantial grating that could withstand the strength of a powerful animal thus they obtained air and proper ventilation without fear of lessening the safety of their cabin the a shaped roof was thatched with small branches laid close together and over these long jungle grass and palm fronds with a final coating of clay the door he built of pieces of the packing boxes which had held their belongings nailing one piece upon another the grain of contiguous layers running transversely until he had a solid body some three inches thick and of such great strength that they were both moved to laughter as they gazed upon it here the greatest difficulty confronted clayton for he had no means whereby to hang his massive door now that he had built it after two days work however he succeeded in fashioning two massive hardwood hinges and with these he hung the door so that it opened and closed easily the stuccoing and other final touches were added after they moved into the house which they had done as soon as the roof was on piling their boxes before the door at night and thus having a comparatively safe and comfortable habitation the building of a bed chairs table and shelves was a relatively easy matter so that by the end of the second month they were well settled and but for the constant dread of attack by wild beasts and the ever growing loneliness they were not uncomfortable or unhappy at night great beasts snarled and roared about their tiny cabin but so accustomed may one become to oft repeated noises that soon they paid little attention to them sleeping soundly the whole night through thrice had they caught fleeting glimpses of great man like figures like that of the first night but never at sufficiently close range to know positively whether the half seen forms were those of man or brute the brilliant birds and the little monkeys had become accustomed to their new acquaintances and as they had evidently never seen human beings before they presently after their first fright had worn off approached closer and closer impelled by that strange curiosity which dominates the wild creatures of the forest and the jungle and the plain so that within the first month several of the birds had gone so far as even to accept morsels of food from the friendly hands of the claytons one afternoon while clayton was working upon an addition to their cabin for he contemplated building several more rooms a number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking and scolding through the trees from the direction of the ridge ever as they fled they cast fearful glances back of them and finally they stopped near clayton jabbering excitedly to him as though to warn him of approaching danger at last he saw it the thing the little monkeys so feared the man brute of which the claytons had caught occasional fleeting glimpses it was approaching through the jungle in a semi erect position now and then placing the backs of its closed fists upon the ground a great anthropoid ape and as it advanced it emitted deep guttural growls and an occasional low barking sound clayton was at some distance from the cabin having come to fell a particularly perfect tree for his building operations grown careless from months of continued safety during which time he had seen no dangerous animals during the daylight hours he had left his rifles and revolvers all within the little cabin and now that he saw the great ape crashing through the underbrush directly toward him and from a direction which practically cut him off from escape he felt a vague little shiver play up and down his spine he knew that armed only with an ax his chances with this ferocious monster were small indeed and alice o god he thought what will become of alice there was yet a slight chance of reaching the cabin he turned and ran toward it shouting an alarm to his wife to run in and close the great door in case the ape cut off his retreat lady greystoke had been sitting a little way from the cabin and when she heard his cry she looked up to see the ape springing with almost incredible swiftness for so large and awkward an animal in an effort to head off clayton with a low cry she sprang toward the cabin and as she entered gave a backward glance which filled her soul with terror for the brute had intercepted her husband who now stood at bay grasping his ax with both hands ready to swing it upon the infuriated animal when he should make his final charge close and bolt the door alice cried clayton i can finish this fellow with my ax but he knew he was facing a horrible death and so did she the ape was a great bull weighing probably three hundred pounds his nasty close set eyes gleamed hatred from beneath his shaggy brows while his great canine fangs were bared in a horrid snarl as he paused a moment before his prey over the brute's shoulder clayton could see the doorway of his cabin not twenty paces distant and a great wave of horror and fear swept over him as he saw his young wife emerge armed with one of his rifles she had always been afraid of firearms and would never touch them but now she rushed toward the ape with the fearlessness of a lioness protecting its young back alice shouted clayton for god's sake go back but she would not heed and just then the ape charged so that clayton could say no more the man swung his ax with all his mighty strength but the powerful brute seized it in those terrible hands and tearing it from clayton's grasp hurled it far to one side with an ugly snarl he closed upon his defenseless victim but ere his fangs had reached the throat they thirsted for there was a sharp report and a bullet entered the ape's back between his shoulders throwing clayton to the ground the beast turned upon his new enemy there before him stood the terrified girl vainly trying to fire another bullet into the animal's body but she did not understand the mechanism of the firearm and the hammer fell futilely upon an empty cartridge almost simultaneously clayton regained his feet and without thought of the utter hopelessness of it he rushed forward to drag the ape from his wife's prostrate form with little or no effort he succeeded and the great bulk rolled inertly upon the turf before him the ape was dead the bullet had done its work a hasty examination of his wife revealed no marks upon her and clayton decided that the huge brute had died the instant he had sprung toward alice gently he lifted his wife's still unconscious form and bore her to the little cabin but it was fully two hours before she regained consciousness her first words filled clayton with vague apprehension for some time after regaining her senses alice gazed wonderingly about the interior of the little cabin and then with a satisfied sigh said o john it is so good to be really home i have had an awful dream dear i thought we were no longer in london but in some horrible place where great beasts attacked us there there alice he said stroking her forehead try to sleep again and do not worry your head about bad dreams that night a little son was born in the tiny cabin beside the primeval forest while a leopard screamed before the door and the deep notes of a lion's roar sounded from beyond the ridge lady greystoke never recovered from the shock of the great ape's attack and though she lived for a year after her baby was born she was never again outside the cabin nor did she ever fully realize that she was not in england sometimes she would question clayton as to the strange noises of the nights the absence of servants and friends and the strange rudeness of the furnishings within her room but though he made no effort to deceive her never could she grasp the meaning of it all in other ways she was quite rational and the joy and happiness she took in the possession of her little son and the constant attentions of her husband made that year a very happy one for her the happiest of her young life that it would have been beset by worries and apprehension had she been in full command of her mental faculties clayton well knew so that while he suffered terribly to see her so there were times when he was almost glad for her sake that she could not understand long since had he given up any hope of rescue except through accident with unremitting zeal he had worked to beautify the interior of the cabin skins of lion and panther covered the floor cupboards and bookcases lined the walls odd vases made by his own hand from the clay of the region held beautiful tropical flowers curtains of grass and bamboo covered the windows and most arduous task of all with his meager assortment of tools he had fashioned lumber to neatly seal the walls and ceiling and lay a smooth floor within the cabin that he had been able to turn his hands at all to such unaccustomed labor was a source of mild wonder to him but he loved the work because it was for her and the tiny life that had come to cheer them though adding a hundredfold to his responsibilities and to the terribleness of their situation during the year that followed clayton was several times attacked by the great apes which now seemed to continually infest the vicinity of the cabin but as he never again ventured outside without both rifle and revolvers he had little fear of the huge beasts he had strengthened the window protections and fitted a unique wooden lock to the cabin door so that when he hunted for game and fruits as it was constantly necessary for him to do to insure sustenance he had no fear that any animal could break into the little home at first he shot much of the game from the cabin windows but toward the end the animals learned to fear the strange lair from whence issued the terrifying thunder of his rifle in his leisure clayton read often aloud to his wife from the store of books he had brought for their new home among these were many for little children picture books primers readers for they had known that their little child would be old enough for such before they might hope to return to england at other times clayton wrote in his diary which he had always been accustomed to keep in french and in which he recorded the details of their strange life this book he kept locked in a little metal box a year from the day her little son was born lady alice passed quietly away in the night so peaceful was her end that it was hours before clayton could awake to a realization that his wife was dead the horror of the situation came to him very slowly and it is doubtful that he ever fully realized the enormity of his sorrow and the fearful responsibility that had devolved upon him with the care of that wee thing his son still a nursing babe the last entry in his diary was made the morning following her death and there he recites the sad details in a matter of fact way that adds to the pathos of it for it breathes a tired apathy born of long sorrow and hopelessness which even this cruel blow could scarcely awake to further suffering my little son is crying for nourishment o alice alice what shall i do and as john clayton wrote the last words his hand was destined ever to pen he dropped his head wearily upon his outstretched arms where they rested upon the table he had built for her who lay still and cold in the bed beside him for a long time no sound broke the deathlike stillness of the jungle midday save the piteous wailing of the tiny man child chapter iv the apes in the forest of the table land a mile back from the ocean old kerchak the ape was on a rampage of rage among his people the younger and lighter members of his tribe scampered to the higher branches of the great trees to escape his wrath risking their lives upon branches that scarce supported their weight rather than face old kerchak in one of his fits of uncontrolled anger the other males scattered in all directions but not before the infuriated brute had felt the vertebra of one snap between his great foaming jaws a luckless young female slipped from an insecure hold upon a high branch and came crashing to the ground almost at kerchak's feet with a wild scream he was upon her tearing a great piece from her side with his mighty teeth and striking her viciously upon her head and shoulders with a broken tree limb until her skull was crushed to a jelly and then he spied kala who returning from a search for food with her young babe was ignorant of the state of the mighty male's temper until suddenly the shrill warnings of her fellows caused her to scamper madly for safety but kerchak was close upon her so close that he had almost grasped her ankle had she not made a furious leap far into space from one tree to another a perilous chance which apes seldom if ever take unless so closely pursued by danger that there is no alternative she made the leap successfully but as she grasped the limb of the further tree the sudden jar loosened the hold of the tiny babe where it clung frantically to her neck and she saw the little thing hurled turning and twisting to the ground thirty feet below with a low cry of dismay kala rushed headlong to its side thoughtless now of the danger from kerchak but when she gathered the wee mangled form to her bosom life had left it with low moans she sat cuddling the body to her nor did kerchak attempt to molest her with the death of the babe his fit of demoniacal rage passed as suddenly as it had seized him kerchak was a huge king ape weighing perhaps three hundred and fifty pounds his forehead was extremely low and receding his eyes bloodshot small and close set to his coarse flat nose his ears large and thin but smaller than most of his kind his awful temper and his mighty strength made him supreme among the little tribe into which he had been born some twenty years before now that he was in his prime there was no simian in all the mighty forest through which he roved that dared contest his right to rule nor did the other and larger animals molest him old tantor the elephant alone of all the wild savage life feared him not and he alone did kerchak fear when tantor trumpeted the great ape scurried with his fellows high among the trees of the second terrace the tribe of anthropoids over which kerchak ruled with an iron hand and bared fangs numbered some six or eight families each family consisting of an adult male with his females and their young numbering in all some sixty or seventy apes kala was the youngest mate of a male called tublat meaning broken nose and the child she had seen dashed to death was her first for she was but nine or ten years old notwithstanding her youth she was large and powerful a splendid clean limbed animal with a round high forehead which denoted more intelligence than most of her kind possessed so also she had a great capacity for mother love and mother sorrow but she was still an ape a huge fierce terrible beast of a species closely allied to the gorilla yet more intelligent which with the strength of their cousin made her kind the most fearsome of those awe inspiring progenitors of man when the tribe saw that kerchak's rage had ceased they came slowly down from their arboreal retreats and pursued again the various occupations which he had interrupted the young played and frolicked about among the trees and bushes some of the adults lay prone upon the soft mat of dead and decaying vegetation which covered the ground while others turned over pieces of fallen branches and clods of earth in search of the small bugs and reptiles which formed a part of their food others again searched the surrounding trees for fruit nuts small birds and eggs they had passed an hour or so thus when kerchak called them together and with a word of command to them to follow him set off toward the sea they traveled for the most part upon the ground where it was open following the path of the great elephants whose comings and goings break the only roads through those tangled mazes of bush vine creeper and tree when they walked it was with a rolling awkward motion placing the knuckles of their"
