half past twelve o'clock soon after his release and affirmed that he was then as red as i was the mild mr chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time if at any time he sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty and said to my aunt in his meekest manner well ma'am i am happy to congratulate you what upon said my aunt sharply mr chillip was fluttered again by the extreme severity of my aunt's manner so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile to mollify her mercy on the man what's he doing cried my aunt impatiently can't he speak be calm my dear ma'am said mr chillip in his softest accents there is no longer any occasion for uneasiness ma'am be calm it has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn't shake him and shake what he had to say out of him she only shook her own head at him but in a way that made him quail well ma'am resumed mr chillip as soon as he had courage i am happy to congratulate you all is now over ma'am and well over during the five minutes or so that mr chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration my aunt eyed him narrowly how is she said my aunt folding her arms with her bonnet still tied on one of them well ma'am she will soon be quite comfortable i hope returned mr chillip quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be under these melancholy domestic circumstances there cannot be any objection to your seeing her presently ma'am it may do her good and she how is she said my aunt sharply mr chillip laid his head a little more on one side and looked at my aunt like an amiable bird the baby said my aunt how is she ma'am returned mr chillip i apprehended you had known it's a boy my aunt said never a word but took her bonnet by the strings in the manner of a sling aimed a blow at mr chillip's head with it put it on bent walked out and never came back she vanished like a discontented fairy or like one of those supernatural beings whom it was popularly supposed i was entitled to see and never came back any more no i lay in my basket and my mother lay in her bed but betsey trotwood copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows the tremendous region whence i had so lately travelled and the light upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such travellers and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he without whom i had never been chapter 2 i observe the first objects that assume a distinct presence before me as i look far back into the blank of my infancy are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape and peggotty with no shape at all and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face and cheeks and arms so hard and red that i wondered the birds didn't peck her in preference to apples i believe i can remember these two at a little distance apart dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor and i going unsteadily from the one to the other i have an impression on my mind which i cannot distinguish from actual remembrance of the touch of peggotty's forefinger as she used to hold it out to me and of its being roughened by needlework like a pocket nutmeg grater this may be fancy though i think the memory of most of us can go farther back into such times than many of us suppose just as i believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy indeed i think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty than to have acquired it the rather as i generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness and gentleness and capacity of being pleased which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood i might have a misgiving that i am meandering in stopping to say this but that it brings me to remark that i build these conclusions in part upon my own experience of myself and if it should appear from anything i may set down in this narrative that i was a child of close observation or that as a man i have a strong memory of my childhood i undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics looking back as i was saying into the blank of my infancy the first objects i can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things are my mother and peggotty what else do i remember let me see there comes out of the cloud our house not new to me but quite familiar in its earliest remembrance on the ground floor is peggotty's kitchen opening into a back yard with a pigeon house on a pole in the centre without any pigeons in it a great dog kennel in a corner without any dog and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me walking about in a menacing and ferocious manner there is one cock who gets upon a post to crow and seems to take particular notice of me as i look at him through the kitchen window who makes me shiver he is so fierce of the geese outside the side gate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched out when i go that way i dream at night as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions here is a long passage what an enormous perspective i make of it leading from peggotty's kitchen to the front door a dark store room opens out of it and that is a place to be run past at night for i don't know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea chests when there is nobody in there with a dimly burning light letting a mouldy air come out of the door in which there is the smell of soap pickles pepper candles and coffee all at one whiff then there are the two parlours the parlour in which we sit of an evening my mother and i and peggotty for peggotty is quite our companion when her work is done and we are alone and the best parlour where we sit on a sunday grandly but not so comfortably there is something of a doleful air about that room to me for peggotty has told me i don't know when but apparently ages ago about my father's funeral and the company having their black cloaks put on one sunday night my mother reads to peggotty and me in there how lazarus was raised up from the dead and i am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window with the dead all lying in their graves at rest below the solemn moon there is nothing half so green that i know anywhere as the grass of that churchyard nothing half so shady as its trees nothing half so quiet as its tombstones the sheep are feeding there when i kneel up early in the morning in my little bed in a closet within my mother's room to look out at it and i see the red light shining on the sun dial and think within myself is the sun dial glad i wonder that it can tell the time again here is our pew in the church what a high backed pew with a window near it out of which our house can be seen and is seen many times during the morning's service by peggotty who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it's not being robbed or is not in flames but though peggotty's eye wanders she is much offended if mine does and frowns to me as i stand upon the seat that i am to look at the clergyman but i can't always look at him i know him without that white thing on and i am afraid of his wondering why i stare so and perhaps stopping the service to inquire and what am i to do it's a dreadful thing to gape but i must do something i look at my mother but she pretends not to see me i look at a boy in the aisle and he makes faces at me i look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch and there i see a stray sheep i don't mean a sinner but mutton half making up his mind to come into the church i feel that if i looked at him any longer i might be tempted to say something out loud and what would become of me then i look up at the monumental tablets on the wall and try to think of mr bodgers late of this parish and what the feelings of mrs bodgers must have been when affliction sore long time mr bodgers bore and physicians were in vain i wonder whether they called in mr chillip and he was in vain and if so how he likes to be reminded of it once a week i look from mr chillip in his sunday neckcloth to the pulpit and think what a good place it would be to play in and what a castle it would make with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head in time my eyes gradually shut up and from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat i hear nothing until i fall off the seat with a crash and am taken out more dead than alive by peggotty and now i see the outside of our house with the latticed bedroom windows standing open to let in the sweet smelling air and the ragged old rooks nests still dangling in the elm trees at the bottom of the front garden now i am in the garden at the back beyond the yard where the empty pigeon house and dog kennel are a very preserve of butterflies as i remember it with a high fence and a gate and padlock where the fruit clusters on the trees riper and richer than fruit has ever been since in any other garden and where my mother gathers some in a basket while i stand by bolting furtive gooseberries and trying to look unmoved a great wind rises and the summer is gone in a moment we are playing in the winter twilight dancing about the parlour when my mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow chair i watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers and straitening her waist and nobody knows better than i do that she likes to look so well and is proud of being so pretty that is among my very earliest impressions that and a sense that we were both a little afraid of peggotty and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction were among the first opinions if they may be so called that i ever derived from what i saw peggotty and i were sitting one night by the parlour fire alone i had been reading to peggotty about crocodiles i must have read very perspicuously or the poor soul must have been deeply interested for i remember she had a cloudy impression after i had done that they were a sort of vegetable i was tired of reading and dead sleepy but having leave as a high treat to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour's i would rather have died upon my post of course than have gone to bed i had reached that stage of sleepiness when peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large i propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work at the little bit of wax candle she kept for her thread how old it looked being so wrinkled in all directions at the little house with a thatched roof where the yard measure lived at her work box with a sliding lid with a view of st paul's cathedral with a pink dome painted on the top at the brass thimble on her finger at herself whom i thought lovely i felt so sleepy that i knew if i lost sight of anything for a moment i was gone peggotty says i suddenly were you ever married lord master davy replied peggotty what's put marriage in your head she answered with such a start that it quite awoke me and then she stopped in her work and looked at me with her needle drawn out to its thread's length but were you ever married peggotty says i you are a very handsome woman an't you i thought her in a different style from my mother certainly but of another school of beauty i considered her a perfect example there was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour on which my mother had painted a nosegay the ground work of that stool and peggotty's complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing the stool was smooth and peggotty was rough but that made no difference me handsome davy said peggotty lawk no my dear but what put marriage in your head i don't know you mustn't marry more than one person at a time may you peggotty certainly not says peggotty with the promptest decision but if you marry a person and the person dies why then you may marry another person mayn't you peggotty you may says peggotty if you choose my dear that's a matter of opinion but what is your opinion peggotty said i i asked her and looked curiously at her because she looked so curiously at me my opinion is said peggotty taking her eyes from me after a little indecision and going on with her work that i never was married myself master davy and that i don't expect to be that's all i know about the subject you an't cross i suppose peggotty are you said i after sitting quiet for a minute i really thought she was she had been so short with me but i was quite mistaken for she laid aside her work which was a stocking of her own and opening her arms wide took my curly head within them and gave it a good squeeze i know it was a good squeeze because being very plump whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off and i recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour while she was hugging me now let me hear some more about the crorkindills said peggotty who was not quite right in the name yet for i an't heard half enough i couldn't quite understand why peggotty looked so queer or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles however we returned to those monsters with fresh wakefulness on my part and we left their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch and we ran away from them and baffled them by constantly turning which they were unable to do quickly on account of their unwieldy make and we went into the water after them as natives and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats and in short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet i did at least but i had my doubts of peggotty who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms all the time we had exhausted the crocodiles and begun with the alligators when the garden bell rang we went out to the door and there was my mother looking unusually pretty i thought and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers who had walked home with us from church last sunday as my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me the gentleman said i was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarch or something like that for my later understanding comes i am sensible to my aid here what does that mean i asked him over her shoulder he patted me on the head but somehow i didn't like him or his deep voice and i was jealous that his hand should touch my mother's in touching me which it did i put it away as well as i could oh davy remonstrated my mother dear boy said the gentleman i cannot wonder at his devotion i never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother's face before she gently chid me for being rude and keeping me close to her shawl turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home she put out her hand to him as she spoke and as he met it with his own she glanced i thought at me let us say good night my fine boy said the gentleman when he had bent his head i saw him over my mother's little glove good night said i come let us be the best friends in the world said the gentleman laughing shake hands my right hand was in my mother's left so i gave him the other why that's the wrong hand davy laughed the gentleman my mother drew my right hand forward but i was resolved for my former reason not to give it him and i did not i gave him the other and he shook it heartily and said i was a brave fellow and went away at this minute i see him turn round in the garden and give us a last look with his ill omened black eyes before the door was shut peggotty who had not said a word or moved a finger secured the fastenings instantly and we all went into the parlour my mother contrary to her usual habit instead of coming to the elbow chair by the fire remained at the other end of the room and sat singing to herself hope you have had a pleasant evening ma'am said peggotty standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room with a candlestick in her hand much obliged to you peggotty returned my mother in a cheerful voice i have had a very pleasant evening a stranger or so makes an agreeable change suggested peggotty a very agreeable change indeed returned my mother peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room and my mother resuming her singing i fell asleep though i was not so sound asleep but that i could hear voices without hearing what they said when i half awoke from this uncomfortable doze i found peggotty and my mother both in tears and both talking not such a one as this mr copperfield wouldn't have liked said peggotty that i say and that i swear good heavens cried my mother you'll drive me mad was ever any poor girl so ill used by her servants as i am why do i do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl have i never been married peggotty god knows you have ma'am returned peggotty then how can you dare said my mother you know i don't mean how can you dare peggotty but how can you have the heart to make me so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me when you are well aware that i haven't out of this place a single friend to turn to the more's the reason returned peggotty for saying that it won't do no that it won't do no no price could make it do no i thought peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away she was so emphatic with it how can you be so aggravating said my mother shedding more tears than before as to talk in such an unjust manner how can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged peggotty when i tell you over and over again you cruel thing that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed you talk of admiration what am i to do if people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment is it my fault what am i to do i ask you would you wish me to shave my head and black my face or disfigure myself with a burn or a scald or something of that sort i dare say you would peggotty i dare say you'd quite enjoy it peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart i thought and my dear boy cried my mother coming to the elbow chair in which i was and caressing me my own little davy is it to be hinted to me that i am wanting in affection for my precious treasure the dearest little fellow that ever was nobody never went and hinted no such a thing said peggotty you did peggotty returned my mother you know you did what else was it possible to infer from what you said you unkind creature when you know as well as i do that on his account only last quarter i wouldn't buy myself a new parasol though that old green one is frayed the whole way up and the fringe is perfectly mangy you know it is peggotty you can't deny it then turning affectionately to me with her cheek against mine am i a naughty mama to you davy am i a nasty cruel selfish bad mama say i am my child say yes dear boy and peggotty will love you and peggotty's love is a great deal better than mine davy i don't love you at all do i at this we all fell a crying together i think i was the loudest of the party but i am sure we were all sincere about it i was quite heart broken myself and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded tenderness i called peggotty a beast that honest creature was in deep affliction i remember and must have become quite buttonless on the occasion for a little volley of those explosives went off when after having made it up with my mother she kneeled down by the elbow chair and made it up with me we went to bed greatly dejected my sobs kept waking me for a long time and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed i found my mother sitting on the coverlet and leaning over me i fell asleep in her arms after that and slept soundly whether it was the following sunday when i saw the gentleman again or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared i cannot recall i don't profess to be clear about dates but there he was in church and he walked home with us afterwards he came in too to look at a famous geranium we had in the parlour window it did not appear to me that he took much notice of it but before he went he asked my mother to give him a bit of the blossom she begged him to choose it for himself but he refused to do that i could not understand why so she plucked it for him and gave it into his hand he said he would never never part with it any more and i thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two peggotty began to be less with us of an evening than she had always been my mother deferred to her very much more than usual it occurred to me and we were all three excellent friends still we were different from what we used to be and were not so comfortable among ourselves sometimes i fancied that peggotty perhaps objected to my mother's wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour's but i couldn't to my satisfaction make out how it was gradually i became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers i liked him no better than at first and had the same uneasy jealousy of him but if i had any reason for it beyond a child's instinctive dislike and a general idea that peggotty and i could make much of my mother without any help it certainly was not the reason that i might have found if i had been older no such thing came into my mind or near it i could observe in little pieces as it were but as to making a net of a number of these pieces and catching anybody in it that was as yet beyond me one autumn morning i was with my mother in the front garden when mr murdstone i knew him by that name now came by on horseback he reined up his horse to salute my mother and said he was going to lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht and merrily proposed to take me on the saddle before him if i would like the ride the air was so clear and pleasant and the horse seemed to like the idea of the ride so much himself as he stood snorting and pawing at the garden gate that i had a great desire to go so i was sent upstairs to peggotty to be made spruce and in the meantime mr murdstone dismounted and with his horse's bridle drawn over his arm walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence while my mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company i recollect peggotty and i peeping out at them from my little window i recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between them as they strolled along and how from being in a perfectly angelic temper peggotty turned cross in a moment and brushed my hair the wrong way excessively hard mr murdstone and i were soon off and trotting along on the green turf by the side of the road he held me quite easily with one arm and i don't think i was restless usually but i could not make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes and looking up in his face he had that kind of shallow black eye i want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into which when it is abstracted seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured for a moment at a time by a cast several times when i glanced at him i observed that appearance with a sort of awe and wondered what he was thinking about so closely his hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker looked at so near than even i had given them credit for being a squareness about the lower part of his face and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day reminded me of the wax work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half a year before this his regular eyebrows and the rich white and black and brown of his complexion confound his complexion and his memory made me think him in spite of my misgivings a very handsome man i have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too we went to an hotel by the sea where two gentlemen were smoking cigars in a room by themselves each of them was lying on at least four chairs and had a large rough jacket on in a corner was a heap of coats and boat cloaks and a flag all bundled up together they both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner when we came in and said halloa murdstone we thought you were dead not yet said mr murdstone and who's this shaver said one of the gentlemen taking hold of me that's davy returned mr murdstone davy who said the gentleman jones copperfield said mr murdstone what bewitching mrs copperfield's encumbrance cried the gentleman the pretty little widow quinion said mr murdstone take care if you please somebody's sharp who is asked the gentleman laughing i looked up quickly being curious to know only brooks of sheffield said mr murdstone i was quite relieved to find that it was only brooks of sheffield for at first i really thought it was i there seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of mr brooks of sheffield for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned and mr murdstone was a"
