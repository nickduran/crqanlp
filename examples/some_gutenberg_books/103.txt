"1" "before nine p.m or else the twenty thousand pounds now deposited in my name at baring's will belong to you in fact and in right gentlemen here is a cheque for the amount a memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties during which phileas fogg preserved a stoical composure he certainly did not bet to win and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds half of his fortune because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult not to say unattainable project as for his antagonists they seemed much agitated not so much by the value of their stake as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend the clock struck seven and the party offered to suspend the game so that mr fogg might make his preparations for departure i am quite ready now was his tranquil response diamonds are trumps be so good as to play gentlemen chapter iv in which phileas fogg astounds passepartout his servant having won twenty guineas at whist and taken leave of his friends phileas fogg at twenty five minutes past seven left the reform club passepartout who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour for according to rule he was not due in saville row until precisely midnight mr fogg repaired to his bedroom and called out passepartout passepartout did not reply it could not be he who was called it was not the right hour passepartout repeated mr fogg without raising his voice passepartout made his appearance i've called you twice observed his master but it is not midnight responded the other showing his watch i know it i don't blame you we start for dover and calais in ten minutes a puzzled grin overspread passepartout's round face clearly he had not comprehended his master monsieur is going to leave home yes returned phileas fogg we are going round the world passepartout opened wide his eyes raised his eyebrows held up his hands and seemed about to collapse so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment round the world he murmured in eighty days responded mr fogg so we haven't a moment to lose but the trunks gasped passepartout unconsciously swaying his head from right to left we'll have no trunks only a carpet bag with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me and the same for you we'll buy our clothes on the way bring down my mackintosh and traveling cloak and some stout shoes though we shall do little walking make haste passepartout tried to reply but could not he went out mounted to his own room fell into a chair and muttered that's good that is and i who wanted to remain quiet he mechanically set about making the preparations for departure around the world in eighty days was his master a fool no was this a joke then they were going to dover good to calais good again after all passepartout who had been away from france five years would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again perhaps they would go as far as paris and it would do his eyes good to see paris once more but surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there no doubt but then it was none the less true that he was going away this so domestic person hitherto by eight o'clock passepartout had packed the modest carpet bag containing the wardrobes of his master and himself then still troubled in mind he carefully shut the door of his room and descended to mr fogg mr fogg was quite ready under his arm might have been observed a red bound copy of bradshaw's continental railway steam transit and general guide with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways he took the carpet bag opened it and slipped into it a goodly roll of bank of england notes which would pass wherever he might go you have forgotten nothing asked he nothing monsieur my mackintosh and cloak here they are good take this carpet bag handing it to passepartout take good care of it for there are twenty thousand pounds in it passepartout nearly dropped the bag as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold and weighed him down master and man then descended the street door was double locked and at the end of saville row they took a cab and drove rapidly to charing cross the cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master who after paying the cabman was about to enter the station when a poor beggar woman with a child in her arms her naked feet smeared with mud her head covered with a wretched bonnet from which hung a tattered feather and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl approached and mournfully asked for alms mr fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist and handed them to the beggar saying here my good woman i'm glad that i met you and passed on passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes his master's action touched his susceptible heart two first class tickets for paris having been speedily purchased mr fogg was crossing the station to the train when he perceived his five friends of the reform well gentlemen said he i'm off you see and if you will examine my passport when i get back you will be able to judge whether i have accomplished the journey agreed upon oh that would be quite unnecessary mr fogg said ralph politely we will trust your word as a gentleman of honour you do not forget when you are due in london again asked stuart in eighty days on saturday the 21st of december 1872 at a quarter before nine p.m good bye gentlemen phileas fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first class carriage at twenty minutes before nine five minutes later the whistle screamed and the train slowly glided out of the station the night was dark and a fine steady rain was falling phileas fogg snugly ensconced in his corner did not open his lips passepartout not yet recovered from his stupefaction clung mechanically to the carpet bag with its enormous treasure just as the train was whirling through sydenham passepartout suddenly uttered a cry of despair what's the matter asked mr fogg alas in my hurry i i forgot what to turn off the gas in my room very well young man returned mr fogg coolly it will burn at your expense chapter v in which a new species of funds unknown to the moneyed men appears on change phileas fogg rightly suspected that his departure from london would create a lively sensation at the west end the news of the bet spread through the reform club and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members from the club it soon got into the papers throughout england the boasted tour of the world was talked about disputed argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another alabama claim some took sides with phileas fogg but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him it was absurd impossible they declared that the tour of the world could be made except theoretically and on paper in this minimum of time and with the existing means of travelling the times standard morning post and daily news and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted mr fogg's project as madness the daily telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him people in general thought him a lunatic and blamed his reform club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question for geography is one of the pet subjects of the english and the columns devoted to phileas fogg's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers at first some rash individuals principally of the gentler sex espoused his cause which became still more popular when the illustrated london news came out with his portrait copied from a photograph in the reform club a few readers of the daily telegraph even dared to say why not after all stranger things have come to pass at last a long article appeared on the 7th of october in the bulletin of the royal geographical society which treated the question from every point of view and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise everything it said was against the travellers every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature a miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival which was impossible was absolutely necessary to his success he might perhaps reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours in europe where the distances were relatively moderate but when he calculated upon crossing india in three days and the united states in seven could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task there were accidents to machinery the liability of trains to run off the line collisions bad weather the blocking up by snow were not all these against phileas fogg would he not find himself when travelling by steamer in winter at the mercy of the winds and fogs is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time but a single delay would suffice to fatally break the chain of communication should phileas fogg once miss even by an hour a steamer he would have to wait for the next and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain this article made a great deal of noise and being copied into all the papers seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist everybody knows that england is the world of betting men who are of a higher class than mere gamblers to bet is in the english temperament not only the members of the reform but the general public made heavy wagers for or against phileas fogg who was set down in the betting books as if he were a race horse bonds were issued and made their appearance on change phileas fogg bonds were offered at par or at a premium and a great business was done in them but five days after the article in the bulletin of the geographical society appeared the demand began to subside phileas fogg declined they were offered by packages at first of five then of ten until at last nobody would take less than twenty fifty a hundred lord albemarle an elderly paralytic gentleman was now the only advocate of phileas fogg left this noble lord who was fastened to his chair would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world if it took ten years and he bet five thousand pounds on phileas fogg when the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him he contented himself with replying if the thing is feasible the first to do it ought to be an englishman the fogg party dwindled more and more everybody was going against him and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one and a week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price the commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o'clock one evening when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his hands suez to london rowan commissioner of police scotland yard i've found the bank robber phileas fogg send with out delay warrant of arrest to bombay fix detective the effect of this dispatch was instantaneous the polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber his photograph which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the reform club was minutely examined and it betrayed feature by feature the description of the robber which had been provided to the police the mysterious habits of phileas fogg were recalled his solitary ways his sudden departure and it seemed clear that in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager he had had no other end in view than to elude the detectives and throw them off his track chapter vi in which fix the detective betrays a very natural impatience the circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about phileas fogg was sent were as follows the steamer mongolia belonging to the peninsular and oriental company built of iron of two thousand eight hundred tons burden and five hundred horse power was due at eleven o'clock a.m on wednesday the 9th of october at suez the mongolia plied regularly between brindisi and bombay via the suez canal and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company always making more than ten knots an hour between brindisi and suez and nine and a half between suez and bombay two men were promenading up and down the wharves among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village now thanks to the enterprise of m lesseps a fast growing town one was the british consul at suez who despite the prophecies of the english government and the unfavourable predictions of stephenson was in the habit of seeing from his office window english ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal by which the old roundabout route from england to india by the cape of good hope was abridged by at least a half the other was a small slight built personage with a nervous intelligent face and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching he was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience nervously pacing up and down and unable to stand still for a moment this was fix one of the detectives who had been dispatched from england in search of the bank robber it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at suez and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at london the detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success and awaited with a feverish impatience easy to understand the arrival of the steamer mongolia so you say consul asked he for the twentieth time that this steamer is never behind time no mr fix replied the consul she was bespoken yesterday at port said and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft i repeat that the mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the company's regulations and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed does she come directly from brindisi directly from brindisi she takes on the indian mails there and she left there saturday at five p.m have patience mr fix she will not be late but really i don't see how from the description you have you will be able to recognise your man even if he is on board the mongolia a man rather feels the presence of these fellows consul than recognises them you must have a scent for them and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing seeing and smelling i've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time and if my thief is on board i'll answer for it he'll not slip through my fingers i hope so mr fix for it was a heavy robbery a magnificent robbery consul fifty five thousand pounds we don't often have such windfalls burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays a fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings mr fix said the consul i like your way of talking and hope you'll succeed but i fear you will find it far from easy don't you see the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man consul remarked the detective dogmatically great robbers always resemble honest folks fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take and that is to remain honest otherwise they would be arrested off hand the artistic thing is to unmask honest countenances it's no light task i admit but a real art mr fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self conceit little by little the scene on the quay became more animated sailors of various nations merchants ship brokers porters fellahs bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected the weather was clear and slightly chilly the minarets of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun a jetty pier some two thousand yards along extended into the roadstead a number of fishing smacks and coasting boats some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys were discernible on the red sea as he passed among the busy crowd fix according to habit scrutinised the passers by with a keen rapid glance it was now half past ten the steamer doesn't come he exclaimed as the port clock struck she can't be far off now returned his companion how long will she stop at suez four hours long enough to get in her coal it is thirteen hundred and ten miles from suez to aden at the other end of the red sea and she has to take in a fresh coal supply and does she go from suez directly to bombay without putting in anywhere good said fix if the robber is on board he will no doubt get off at suez so as to reach the dutch or french colonies in asia by some other route he ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in india which is english soil unless objected the consul he is exceptionally shrewd an english criminal you know is always better concealed in london than anywhere else this observation furnished the detective food for thought and meanwhile the consul went away to his office fix left alone was more impatient than ever having a presentiment that the robber was on board the mongolia if he had indeed left london intending to reach the new world he would naturally take the route via india which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the atlantic but fix's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles which announced the arrival of the mongolia the porters and fellahs rushed down the quay and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road she brought an unusual number of passengers some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town while the greater part disembarked in the boats and landed on the quay fix took up a position and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance presently one of the passengers after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the english consulate at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed fix instinctively took the passport and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer an involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from scotland yard is this your passport asked he no it's my master's and your master is he stayed on board but he must go to the consul's in person so as to establish his identity oh is that necessary quite indispensable and where is the consulate there on the corner of the square said fix pointing to a house two hundred steps off i'll go and fetch my master who won't be much pleased however to be disturbed the passenger bowed to fix and returned to the steamer chapter vii which once more demonstrates the uselessness of passports as aids to detectives the detective passed down the quay and rapidly made his way to the consul's office where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official consul said he without preamble i have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the mongolia and he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport well mr fix replied the consul i shall not be sorry to see the rascal's face but perhaps he won't come here that is if he is the person you suppose him to be a robber doesn't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him and besides he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned if he is as shrewd as i think he is consul he will come to have his passport visaed yes passports are only good for annoying honest folks and aiding in the flight of rogues i assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do but i hope you will not visa the passport why not if the passport is genuine i have no right to refuse still i must keep this man here until i can get a warrant to arrest him from london ah that's your look out but i cannot the consul did not finish his sentence for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door and two strangers entered one of whom was the servant whom fix had met on the quay the other who was his master held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it the consul took the document and carefully read it whilst fix observed or rather devoured the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room you are mr phileas fogg said the consul after reading the passport i am and this man is your servant he is a frenchman named passepartout you are from london yes and you are going to bombay very good sir you know that a visa is useless and that no passport is required i know it sir replied phileas fogg but i wish to prove by your visa that i came by suez very well sir the consul proceeded to sign and date the passport after which he added his official seal mr fogg paid the customary fee coldly bowed and went out followed by his servant well queried the detective well he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man replied the consul possibly but that is not the question do you think consul that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles feature by feature the robber whose description i have received i concede that but then you know all descriptions i'll make certain of it interrupted fix the servant seems to me less mysterious than the master besides he's a frenchman and can't help talking excuse me for a little while consul fix started off in search of passepartout meanwhile mr fogg after leaving the consulate repaired to the quay gave some orders to passepartout went off to the mongolia in a boat and descended to his cabin he took up his note book which contained the following memoranda left london wednesday october 2nd at 8.45 p.m reached paris thursday october 3rd at 7.20 a.m left paris thursday at 8.40 a.m reached turin by mont cenis friday october 4th at 6.35 a.m left turin friday at 7.20 a.m arrived at brindisi saturday october 5th at 4 p.m sailed on the mongolia saturday at 5 p.m reached suez wednesday october 9th at 11 a.m total of hours spent 158 or in days six days and a half these dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns indicating the month the day of the month and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point paris brindisi suez bombay calcutta singapore hong kong yokohama san francisco new york and london from the 2nd of october to the 21st of december and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality this methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed and mr fogg always knew whether he was behind hand or in advance of his time on this friday october 9th he noted his arrival at suez and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost he sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin never once thinking of inspecting the town being one of those englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics chapter viii in which passepartout talks rather more perhaps than is prudent fix soon rejoined passepartout who was lounging and looking about on the quay as if he did not feel that he at least was obliged not to see anything well my friend said the detective coming up with him is your passport visaed ah it's you is it monsieur responded passepartout thanks yes the passport is all right and you are looking about you yes but we travel so fast that i seem to be journeying in a dream so this is suez yes in egypt certainly in egypt and in africa in africa in africa repeated passepartout just think monsieur i had no idea that we should go farther than paris and all that i saw of paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning between the northern and the lyons stations through the windows of a car and in a driving rain how i regret not having seen once more pere la chaise and the circus in the champs elysees you are in a great hurry then i am not but my master is by the way i must buy some shoes and shirts we came away without trunks only with a carpet bag i will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want really monsieur you are very kind and they walked off together passepartout chatting volubly as they went along above all said he don't let me lose the steamer you have plenty of time it's only twelve o'clock passepartout pulled out his big watch twelve he exclaimed why it's only eight minutes before ten your watch is slow my watch a family watch monsieur which has come down from my great grandfather it doesn't vary five minutes in the year it's a perfect chronometer look you i see how it is said fix you have kept london time which is two hours behind that of suez you ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country i regulate my watch never well then it will not agree with the sun so much the worse for the sun monsieur the sun will be wrong then and the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture after a few minutes silence fix resumed you left london hastily then i rather think so last friday at eight o'clock in the evening monsieur fogg came home from his club and three quarters of an hour afterwards we were off but where is your master going always straight ahead he is going round the world round the world cried fix yes and in eighty days he says it is on a wager but between us i don't believe a word of it that wouldn't be common sense there's something else in the wind ah mr fogg is a character is he i should say he was is he rich no doubt for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him and he doesn't spare the money on the way either he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the mongolia if he gets us to bombay well in advance of time and you have known your master a long time why no i entered his service the very day we left london the effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined the hasty departure from london soon after the robbery the large sum carried by mr fogg his eagerness to reach distant countries the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet all confirmed fix in his theory he continued to pump poor passepartout and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master who lived a solitary existence in london was said to be rich though no one knew whence came his riches and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits fix felt sure that phileas fogg would not land at suez but was really going on to bombay is bombay far from here asked passepartout pretty far it is a ten days voyage by sea and in what country is bombay india in asia certainly the deuce i was going to tell you there's one thing that worries me my burner what burner my gas burner which i forgot to turn off and which is at this moment burning at my expense i have calculated monsieur that i lose two shillings every four and twenty hours exactly sixpence more than i earn and you will understand that the longer our journey did fix pay any attention to passepartout's trouble about the gas it is not probable he was not listening but was cogitating a project passepartout and he had now reached"
