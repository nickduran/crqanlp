"1" "the seventeen young princes and princesses were used to it for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs but the baby was not used to it yet and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye the way the poor little darling came to tumble was that he was out of the princess alicia’s lap just as she was sitting in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her in front of the kitchen fire beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner and the way she came to be doing that was that the king’s cook had run away that morning with her own true love who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier then the seventeen young princes and princesses who cried at everything that happened cried and roared but the princess alicia who couldn’t help crying a little herself quietly called to them to be still on account of not throwing back the queen up stairs who was fast getting well and said hold your tongues you wicked little monkeys every one of you while i examine baby then she examined baby and found that he hadn’t broken anything and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye and smoothed his poor dear face and he presently fell asleep in her arms then she said to the seventeen princes and princesses i am afraid to let him down yet lest he should wake and feel pain be good and you shall all be cooks they jumped for joy when they heard that and began making themselves cooks caps out of old newspapers so to one she gave the salt box and to one she gave the barley and to one she gave the herbs and to one she gave the turnips and to one she gave the carrots and to one she gave the onions and to one she gave the spice box till they were all cooks and all running about at work she sitting in the middle smothered in the great coarse apron nursing baby by and by the broth was done and the baby woke up smiling like an angel and was trusted to the sedatest princess to hold while the other princes and princesses were squeezed into a far off corner to look at the princess alicia turning out the saucepanful of broth for fear as they were always getting into trouble they should get splashed and scalded when the broth came tumbling out steaming beautifully and smelling like a nosegay good to eat they clapped their hands that made the baby clap his hands and that and his looking as if he had a comic toothache made all the princes and princesses laugh so the princess alicia said laugh and be good and after dinner we will make him a nest on the floor in a corner and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks that delighted the young princes and princesses and they ate up all the broth and washed up all the plates and dishes and cleared away and pushed the table into a corner and then they in their cooks caps and the princess alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby who forgot his swelled face and his black eye and crowed with joy and so then once more the princess alicia saw king watkins the first her father standing in the doorway looking on and he said what have you been doing alicia cooking and contriving papa what else have you been doing alicia keeping the children light hearted papa where is the magic fish bone alicia in my pocket papa i thought you had lost it o no papa or forgotten it no indeed papa the king then sighed so heavily and seemed so low spirited and sat down so miserably leaning his head upon his hand and his elbow upon the kitchen table pushed away in the corner that the seventeen princes and princesses crept softly out of the kitchen and left him alone with the princess alicia and the angelic baby what is the matter papa i am dreadfully poor my child have you no money at all papa none my child is there no way of getting any papa no way said the king i have tried very hard and i have tried all ways when she heard those last words the princess alicia began to put her hand into the pocket where she kept the magic fish bone papa said she when we have tried very hard and tried all ways we must have done our very very best no doubt alicia when we have done our very very best papa and that is not enough then i think the right time must have come for asking help of others this was the very secret connected with the magic fish bone which she had found out for herself from the good fairy grandmarina’s words and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the duchess so she took out of her pocket the magic fish bone that had been dried and rubbed and polished till it shone like mother of pearl and she gave it one little kiss and wished it was quarter day and immediately it _was_ quarter day and the king’s quarter’s salary came rattling down the chimney and bounced into the middle of the floor but this was not half of what happened no not a quarter for immediately afterwards the good fairy grandmarina came riding in in a carriage and four peacocks with mr pickles’s boy up behind dressed in silver and gold with a cocked hat powdered hair pink silk stockings a jewelled cane and a nosegay down jumped mr pickles’s boy with his cocked hat in his hand and wonderfully polite being entirely changed by enchantment and handed grandmarina out and there she stood in her rich shot silk smelling of dried lavender fanning herself with a sparkling fan alicia my dear said this charming old fairy how do you do i hope i see you pretty well give me a kiss the princess alicia embraced her and then grandmarina turned to the king and said rather sharply are you good the king said he hoped so i suppose you know the reason _now_ why my god daughter here kissing the princess again did not apply to the fish bone sooner said the fairy the king made a shy bow ah but you didn’t _then_ said the fairy the king made a shyer bow any more reasons to ask for said the fairy the king said no and he was very sorry be good then said the fairy and live happy ever afterwards then grandmarina waved her fan and the queen came in most splendidly dressed and the seventeen young princes and princesses no longer grown out of their clothes came in newly fitted out from top to toe with tucks in everything to admit of its being let out after that the fairy tapped the princess alicia with her fan and the smothering coarse apron flew away and she appeared exquisitely dressed like a little bride with a wreath of orange flowers and a silver veil after that the kitchen dresser changed of itself into a wardrobe made of beautiful woods and gold and looking glass which was full of dresses of all sorts all for her and all exactly fitting her after that the angelic baby came in running alone with his face and eye not a bit the worse but much the better then grandmarina begged to be introduced to the duchess and when the duchess was brought down many compliments passed between them a little whispering took place between the fairy and the duchess and then the fairy said out loud yes i thought she would have told you grandmarina then turned to the king and queen and said we are going in search of prince certainpersonio the pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely so she and the princess alicia got into the carriage and mr pickles’s boy handed in the duchess who sat by herself on the opposite seat and then mr pickles’s boy put up the steps and got up behind and the peacocks flew away with their tails behind prince certainpersonio was sitting by himself eating barley sugar and waiting to be ninety when he saw the peacocks followed by the carriage coming in at the window it immediately occurred to him that something uncommon was going to happen prince said grandmarina i bring you your bride the moment the fairy said those words prince certainpersonio’s face left off being sticky and his jacket and corduroys changed to peach bloom velvet and his hair curled and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and settled on his head he got into the carriage by the fairy’s invitation and there he renewed his acquaintance with the duchess whom he had seen before in the church were the prince’s relations and friends and the princess alicia’s relations and friends and the seventeen princes and princesses and the baby and a crowd of the neighbours the marriage was beautiful beyond expression the duchess was bridesmaid and beheld the ceremony from the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk grandmarina gave a magnificent wedding feast afterwards in which there was everything and more to eat and everything and more to drink the wedding cake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons frosted silver and white lilies and was forty two yards round when grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple and prince certainpersonio had made a speech and everybody had cried hip hip hip hurrah grandmarina announced to the king and queen that in future there would be eight quarter days in every year except in leap year when there would be ten she then turned to certainpersonio and alicia and said my dears you will have thirty five children and they will all be good and beautiful seventeen of your children will be boys and eighteen will be girls the hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally they will never have the measles and will have recovered from the whooping cough before being born on hearing such good news everybody cried out hip hip hip hurrah again it only remains said grandmarina in conclusion to make an end of the fish bone so she took it from the hand of the princess alicia and it instantly flew down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug dog next door and choked him and he expired in convulsions part iii romance from the pen of lieut col robin redforth 266 the subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted himself to the pirate profession at a comparatively early age we find him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns loaded to the muzzle ere yet he had had a party in honour of his tenth birthday it seems that our hero considering himself spited by a latin grammar master demanded the satisfaction due from one man of honour to another not getting it he privately withdrew his haughty spirit from such low company bought a second hand pocket pistol folded up some sandwiches in a paper bag made a bottle of spanish liquorice water and entered on a career of valour it were tedious to follow boldheart for such was his name through the commencing stages of his story suffice it that we find him bearing the rank of capt boldheart reclining in full uniform on a crimson hearth rug spread out upon the quarter deck of his schooner the beauty in the china seas it was a lovely evening and as his crew lay grouped about him he favoured them with the following melody o landsmen are folly o pirates are jolly o diddleum dolly di _chorus_ heave yo the soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich tones of boldheart may be more easily conceived than described it was under these circumstances that the look out at the masthead gave the word whales all was now activity where away cried capt boldheart starting up on the larboard bow sir replied the fellow at the masthead touching his hat for such was the height of discipline on board of the beauty that even at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot through the head this adventure belongs to me said boldheart boy my harpoon let no man follow and leaping alone into his boat the captain rowed with admirable dexterity in the direction of the monster all was now excitement he nears him said an elderly seaman following the captain through his spy glass he strikes him said another seaman a mere stripling but also with a spy glass he tows him towards us said another seaman a man in the full vigour of life but also with a spy glass in fact the captain was seen approaching with the huge bulk following we will not dwell on the deafening cries of boldheart boldheart with which he was received when carelessly leaping on the quarter deck he presented his prize to his men they afterwards made two thousand four hundred and seventeen pound ten and sixpence by it ordering the sail to be braced up the captain now stood w.n.w the beauty flew rather than floated over the dark blue waters nothing particular occurred for a fortnight except taking with considerable slaughter four spanish galleons and a snow from south america all richly laden inaction began to tell upon the spirits of the men capt boldheart called all hands aft and said my lads i hear there are discontented ones among ye let any such stand forth after some murmuring in which the expressions ay ay sir union jack avast starboard port bowsprit and similar indications of a mutinous undercurrent though subdued were audible bill boozey captain of the foretop came out from the rest his form was that of a giant but he quailed under the captain’s eye what are your wrongs said the captain why d’ye see capt boldheart replied the towering manner i’ve sailed man and boy for many a year but i never yet know’d the milk served out for the ship’s company’s teas to be so sour as tis aboard this craft at this moment the thrilling cry man overboard announced to the astonished crew that boozey in stepping back as the captain in mere thoughtfulness laid his hand upon the faithful pocket pistol which he wore in his belt had lost his balance and was struggling with the foaming tide all was now stupefaction but with capt boldheart to throw off his uniform coat regardless of the various rich orders with which it was decorated and to plunge into the sea after the drowning giant was the work of a moment maddening was the excitement when boats were lowered intense the joy when the captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth deafening the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of the beauty and from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones capt boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as william boozey boldheart now pointed to the horizon and called the attention of his crew to the taper spars of a ship lying snug in harbour under the guns of a fort she shall be ours at sunrise said he serve out a double allowance of grog and prepare for action all was now preparation when morning dawned after a sleepless night it was seen that the stranger was crowding on all sail to come out of the harbour and offer battle as the two ships came nearer to each other the stranger fired a gun and hoisted roman colours boldheart then perceived her to be the latin grammar master’s bark such indeed she was and had been tacking about the world in unavailing pursuit from the time of his first taking to a roving life boldheart now addressed his men promising to blow them up if he should feel convinced that their reputation required it and giving orders that the latin grammar master should be taken alive he then dismissed them to their quarters and the fight began with a broadside from the beauty she then veered around and poured in another the scorpion so was the bark of the latin grammar master appropriately called was not slow to return her fire and a terrific cannonading ensued in which the guns of the beauty did tremendous execution the latin grammar master was seen upon the poop in the midst of the smoke and fire encouraging his men to do him justice he was no craven though his white hat his short gray trousers and his long snuff coloured surtout reaching to his heels the self same coat in which he had spited boldheart contrasted most unfavourably with the brilliant uniform of the latter at this moment boldheart seizing a pike and putting himself at the head of his men gave the word to board a desperate conflict ensued in the hammock nettings or somewhere in about that direction until the latin grammar master having all his masts gone his hull and rigging shot through and seeing boldheart slashing a path towards him hauled down his flag himself gave up his sword to boldheart and asked for quarter scarce had he been put into the captain’s boat ere the scorpion went down with all on board on capt boldheart’s now assembling his men a circumstance occurred he found it necessary with one blow of his cutlass to kill the cook who having lost his brother in the late action was making at the latin grammar master in an infuriated state intent on his destruction with a carving knife capt boldheart then turned to the latin grammar master severely reproaching him with his perfidy and put it to his crew what they considered that a master who spited a boy deserved they answered with one voice death it may be so said the captain but it shall never be said that boldheart stained his hour of triumph with the blood of his enemy prepare the cutter the cutter was immediately prepared without taking your life said the captain i must yet for ever deprive you of the power of spiting other boys i shall turn you adrift in this boat you will find in her two oars a compass a bottle of rum a small cask of water a piece of pork a bag of biscuit and my latin grammar go and spite the natives if you can find any deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm the unhappy wretch was put into the cutter and was soon left far behind he made no effort to row but was seen lying on his back with his legs up when last made out by the ship’s telescopes a stiff breeze now beginning to blow capt boldheart gave orders to keep her s.s.w easing her a little during the night by falling off a point or two w by w or even by w.s if she complained much he then retired for the night having in truth much need of repose in addition to the fatigues he had undergone this brave officer had received sixteen wounds in the engagement but had not mentioned it in the morning a white squall came on and was succeeded by other squalls of various colours it thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks hurricanes then set in for two months waterspouts and tornadoes followed the oldest sailor on board and he was a very old one had never seen such weather the beauty lost all idea where she was and the carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold everybody fell senseless at the pumps every day provisions now ran very low our hero put the crew on short allowance and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship but his spirit kept him fat in this extremity the gratitude of boozey the captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember was truly affecting the loving though lowly william repeatedly requested to be killed and preserved for the captain’s table we now approach a change of affairs one day during a gleam of sunshine and when the weather had moderated the man at the masthead too weak now to touch his hat besides its having been blown away called out savages all was now expectation presently fifteen hundred canoes each paddled by twenty savages were seen advancing in excellent order they were of a light green colour the savages were and sang with great energy the following strain choo a choo a choo tooth muntch muntch nycey choo a choo a choo tooth muntch muntch nycey as the shades of night were by this time closing in these expressions were supposed to embody this simple people’s views of the evening hymn but it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of for what we are going to receive c the chief imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours and having the majestic appearance of a fighting parrot no sooner understood he understood english perfectly that the ship was the beauty capt boldheart than he fell upon his face on the deck and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up and told him he wouldn’t hurt him all the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror and had also to be lifted up one by one thus the fame of the great boldheart had gone before him even among these children of nature turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal after dinner the chief told capt boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there apprehensive of treachery boldheart ordered his boat’s crew to attend him completely armed and well were it for other commanders if their precautions but let us not anticipate when the canoes arrived at the beach the darkness of the night was illumined by the light of an immense fire ordering his boat’s crew with the intrepid though illiterate william at their head to keep close and be upon their guard boldheart bravely went on arm in arm with the chief but how to depict the captain’s surprise when he found a ring of savages singing in chorus that barbarous translation of for what we are going to receive c which has been given above and dancing hand in hand round the latin grammar master in a hamper with his head shaved while two savages floured him before putting him to the fire to be cooked boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to be adopted in the mean time the miserable captive never ceased begging pardon and imploring to be delivered on the generous boldheart’s proposal it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked but should be allowed to remain raw on two conditions namely 1 that he should never under any circumstances presume to teach any boy anything any more 2 that if taken back to england he should pass his life in travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done and should do their exercises for those boys for nothing and never say a word about it drawing the sword from its sheath boldheart swore him to these conditions on its shining blade the prisoner wept bitterly and appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career the captain then ordered his boat’s crew to make ready for a volley and after firing to re load quickly and expect a score or two on ye to go head over heels murmured william boozey for i’m a looking at ye with those words the derisive though deadly william took a good aim fire the ringing voice of boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and the screeching of the savages volley after volley awakened the numerous echoes hundreds of savages were killed hundreds wounded and thousands ran howling into the woods the latin grammar master had a spare night cap lent him and a long tail coat which he wore hind side before he presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance and serve him right we now find capt boldheart with this rescued wretch on board standing off for other islands at one of these not a cannibal island but a pork and vegetable one he married only in fun on his part the king’s daughter here he rested some time receiving from the natives great quantities of precious stones gold dust elephants teeth and sandal wood and getting very rich this too though he almost every day made presents of enormous value to his men the ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of valuable things boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor and turn the beauty’s head towards england these orders were obeyed with three cheers and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile william we next find capt boldheart about three leagues off madeira surveying through his spy glass a stranger of suspicious appearance making sail towards him on his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to she ran up a flag which he instantly recognised as the flag from the mast in the back garden at home inferring from this that his father had put to sea to seek his long lost son the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger to inquire if this was so and if so whether his father’s intentions were strictly honourable the boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat and reported that the stranger was the family of twelve hundred tons and had not only the captain’s father on board but also his mother with the majority of his aunts and uncles and all his cousins it was further reported to boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board the beauty and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day it was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the latin grammar master that thankless traitor was found out as the two ships lay near each other communicating with the family by signals and offering to give up boldheart he was hanged at the yard arm the first thing in the morning after having it impressively pointed out to him by boldheart that this was what spiters came to the meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears his uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too but he wasn’t going to stand that his cousins were very much astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men and were greatly overcome by the splendour of his uniform he kindly conducted them round the vessel and pointed out everything worthy of notice he also fired his hundred guns and found it amusing to witness their alarm the entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship and lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning only one disagreeable incident occurred capt boldheart found himself obliged to put his cousin tom in irons for being disrespectful on the boy’s promising amendment however he was humanely released after a few hours close confinement boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin and asked after the young lady with whom it was well known to the world he was in love his mother replied that the object of his affections was then at school at margate for the benefit of sea bathing it was the month of september but that she feared the young lady’s friends were still opposed to the union boldheart at once resolved if necessary to bombard the town taking the command of his ship with this intention and putting all but fighting men on board the family with orders to that vessel to keep in company boldheart soon anchored in margate roads here he went ashore well armed and attended by his boat’s crew at their head the faithful though ferocious william and demanded to see the mayor who came out of his office dost know the name of yon ship mayor asked boldheart fiercely no said the mayor rubbing his eyes which he could scarce believe when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor she is named the beauty said the captain hah exclaimed the mayor with a start and you then are capt boldheart the same a pause ensued the mayor trembled now mayor said the captain choose help me to my bride or be bombarded the mayor begged for two hours grace in which to make inquiries respecting the young lady boldheart accorded him but one and"
