"1" "for a moment he seemed impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene or rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass of the sights and sounds of man human shapes interferences troubles and joys were all as if they were not and there seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient being save himself he could fancy them all gone round to the sunny side occupied thus with eyes stretched afar oak gradually perceived that what he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no such thing it was an artificial light almost close at hand to find themselves utterly alone at night where company is desirable and expected makes some people fearful but a case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some mysterious companionship when intuition sensation memory analogy testimony probability induction every kind of evidence in the logician's list have united to persuade consciousness that it is quite in isolation farmer oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower boughs to the windy side a dim mass under the slope reminded him that a shed occupied a place here the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill so that at its back part the roof was almost level with the ground in front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with tar as a preservative through crevices in the roof and side spread streaks and dots of light a combination of which made the radiance that had attracted him oak stepped up behind where leaning down upon the roof and putting his eye close to a hole he could see into the interior clearly the place contained two women and two cows by the side of the latter a steaming bran mash stood in a bucket one of the women was past middle age her companion was apparently young and graceful he could form no decided opinion upon her looks her position being almost beneath his eye so that he saw her in a bird's eye view as milton's satan first saw paradise she wore no bonnet or hat but had enveloped herself in a large cloak which was carelessly flung over her head as a covering there now we'll go home said the elder of the two resting her knuckles upon her hips and looking at their goings on as a whole i do hope daisy will fetch round again now i have never been more frightened in my life but i don't mind breaking my rest if she recovers the young woman whose eyelids were apparently inclined to fall together on the smallest provocation of silence yawned without parting her lips to any inconvenient extent whereupon gabriel caught the infection and slightly yawned in sympathy i wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these things she said as we are not we must do them ourselves said the other for you must help me if you stay well my hat is gone however continued the younger it went over the hedge i think the idea of such a slight wind catching it the cow standing erect was of the devon breed and was encased in a tight warm hide of rich indian red as absolutely uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour her long back being mathematically level the other was spotted grey and white beside her oak now noticed a little calf about a day old looking idiotically at the two women which showed that it had not long been accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight and often turning to the lantern which it apparently mistook for the moon inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience between the sheep and the cows lucina had been busy on norcombe hill lately i think we had better send for some oatmeal said the elder woman there's no more bran yes aunt and i'll ride over for it as soon as it is light but there's no side saddle i can ride on the other trust me oak upon hearing these remarks became more curious to observe her features but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of the cloak and by his aerial position he felt himself drawing upon his fancy for their details in making even horizontal and clear inspections we colour and mould according to the wants within us whatever our eyes bring in had gabriel been able from the first to get a distinct view of her countenance his estimate of it as very handsome or slightly so would have been as his soul required a divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one having for some time known the want of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing void within him his position moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy he painted her a beauty by one of those whimsical coincidences in which nature like a busy mother seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn and make her children smile the girl now dropped the cloak and forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon myrtles and looking glass prosily as the woman who owed him twopence they placed the calf beside its mother again took up the lantern and went out the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a nebula gabriel oak returned to his flock chapter iii a girl on horseback conversation the sluggish day began to break even its position terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest and for no particular reason save that the incident of the night had occurred there oak went again into the plantation lingering and musing here he heard the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill and soon there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on its back ascending by the path leading past the cattle shed she was the young woman of the night before gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the wind possibly she had come to look for it he hastily scanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it found the hat among the leaves gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his hut here he ensconced himself and peeped through the loophole in the direction of the rider's approach she came up and looked around then on the other side of the hedge gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an unexpected performance induced him to suspend the action for the present the path after passing the cowshed bisected the plantation it was not a bridle path merely a pedestrian's track and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them the girl who wore no riding habit looked around for a moment as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony's back her head over its tail her feet against its shoulders and her eyes to the sky the rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a kingfisher its noiselessness that of a hawk gabriel's eyes had scarcely been able to follow her the tall lank pony seemed used to such doings and ambled along unconcerned thus she passed under the level boughs the performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse's head and its tail and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the passage of the plantation she began to adopt another even more obviously convenient than the first she had no side saddle and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was unattainable sideways springing to her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling and satisfying herself that nobody was in sight she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle though hardly expected of the woman and trotted off in the direction of tewnell mill oak was amused perhaps a little astonished and hanging up the hat in his hut went again among his ewes an hour passed the girl returned properly seated now with a bag of bran in front of her on nearing the cattle shed she was met by a boy bringing a milking pail who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off the boy led away the horse leaving the pail with the young woman soon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came in regular succession from within the shed the obvious sounds of a person milking a cow gabriel took the lost hat in his hand and waited beside the path she would follow in leaving the hill she came the pail in one hand hanging against her knee the left arm was extended as a balance enough of it being shown bare to make oak wish that the event had happened in the summer when the whole would have been revealed there was a bright air and manner about her now by which she seemed to imply that the desirability of her existence could not be questioned and this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive because a beholder felt it to be upon the whole true like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius that which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to recognised power it was with some surprise that she saw gabriel's face rising like the moon behind the hedge the adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her charms to the portrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution than a difference the starting point selected by the judgment was her height she seemed tall but the pail was a small one and the hedge diminutive hence making allowance for error by comparison with these she could have been not above the height to be chosen by women as best all features of consequence were severe and regular it may have been observed by persons who go about the shires with eyes for beauty that in englishwoman a classically formed face is seldom found to be united with a figure of the same pattern the highly finished features being generally too large for the remainder of the frame that a graceful and proportionate figure of eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves without throwing a nymphean tissue over a milkmaid let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out of place and looked at her proportions with a long consciousness of pleasure from the contours of her figure in its upper part she must have had a beautiful neck and shoulders but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them had she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her head into a bush yet she was not a shy girl by any means it was merely her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen higher than they do it in towns that the girl's thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as she caught oak's eyes conning the same page was natural and almost certain the self consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little more pronounced dignity if a little less rays of male vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural districts she brushed hers with her hand as if gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual touch and the free air of her previous movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of itself yet it was the man who blushed the maid not at all i found a hat said oak it is mine said she and from a sense of proportion kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh distinctly it flew away last night one o'clock this morning well it was she was surprised how did you know she said i was here you are farmer oak are you not that or thereabouts i'm lately come to this place a large farm she inquired casting her eyes round and swinging back her hair which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass but it being now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent curves with a colour of their own no not large about a hundred in speaking of farms the word acres is omitted by the natives by analogy to such old expressions as a stag of ten i wanted my hat this morning she went on i had to ride to tewnell mill yes you had how do you know i saw you where she inquired a misgiving bringing every muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill here going through the plantation and all down the hill said farmer oak with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some matter in his mind as he gazed at a remote point in the direction named and then turned back to meet his colloquist's eyes a perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a theft recollection of the strange antics she had indulged in when passing through the trees was succeeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation and that by a hot face it was a time to see a woman redden who was not given to reddening as a rule not a point in the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose colour from the maiden's blush through all varieties of the provence down to the crimson tuscany the countenance of oak's acquaintance quickly graduated whereupon he in considerateness turned away his head the sympathetic man still looked the other way and wondered when she would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again he heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze and looked she had gone away with an air between that of tragedy and comedy gabriel returned to his work five mornings and evenings passed the young woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one but never allowed her vision to stray in the direction of oak's person his want of tact had deeply offended her not by seeing what he could not help but by letting her know that he had seen it for as without law there is no sin without eyes there is no indecorum and she appeared to feel that gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman without her own connivance it was food for great regret with him it was also a _contretemps_ which touched into life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction the acquaintanceship might however have ended in a slow forgetting but for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week one afternoon it began to freeze and the frost increased with evening which drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds it was a time when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets when round the drawing room fire of a thick walled mansion the sitters backs are cold even whilst their faces are all aglow many a small bird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs as the milking hour drew near oak kept his usual watch upon the cowshed at last he felt cold and shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon the stove the wind came in at the bottom of the door and to prevent it oak laid a sack there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the south then the wind spouted in at a ventilating hole of which there was one on each side of the hut gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept open that chosen being always on the side away from the wind closing the slide to windward he turned to open the other on second thoughts the farmer considered that he would first sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two till the temperature of the hut was a little raised he sat down his head began to ache in an unwonted manner and fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights oak decided to get up open the slide and then allow himself to fall asleep he fell asleep however without having performed the necessary preliminary how long he remained unconscious gabriel never knew during the first stages of his return to perception peculiar deeds seemed to be in course of enactment his dog was howling his head was aching fearfully somebody was pulling him about hands were loosening his neckerchief on opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness the young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white teeth was beside him more than this astonishingly more his head was upon her lap his face and neck were disagreeably wet and her fingers were unbuttoning his collar whatever is the matter said oak vacantly she seemed to experience mirth but of too insignificant a kind to start enjoyment nothing now she answered since you are not dead it is a wonder you were not suffocated in this hut of yours ah the hut murmured gabriel i gave ten pounds for that hut but i'll sell it and sit under thatched hurdles as they did in old times and curl up to sleep in a lock of straw it played me nearly the same trick the other day gabriel by way of emphasis brought down his fist upon the floor it was not exactly the fault of the hut she observed in a tone which showed her to be that novelty among women one who finished a thought before beginning the sentence which was to convey it you should i think have considered and not have been so foolish as to leave the slides closed yes i suppose i should said oak absently he was endeavouring to catch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her his head upon her dress before the event passed on into the heap of bygone things he wished she knew his impressions but he would as soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of attempting to convey the intangibilities of his feeling in the coarse meshes of language so he remained silent she made him sit up and then oak began wiping his face and shaking himself like a samson how can i thank ee he said at last gratefully some of the natural rusty red having returned to his face oh never mind that said the girl smiling and allowing her smile to hold good for gabriel's next remark whatever that might prove to be how did you find me i heard your dog howling and scratching at the door of the hut when i came to the milking it was so lucky daisy's milking is almost over for the season and i shall not come here after this week or the next the dog saw me and jumped over to me and laid hold of my skirt i came across and looked round the hut the very first thing to see if the slides were closed my uncle has a hut like this one and i have heard him tell his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide open i opened the door and there you were like dead i threw the milk over you as there was no water forgetting it was warm and no use i wonder if i should have died gabriel said in a low voice which was rather meant to travel back to himself than to her oh no the girl replied she seemed to prefer a less tragic probability to have saved a man from death involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of such a deed and she shunned it i believe you saved my life miss i don't know your name i know your aunt's but not yours i would just as soon not tell it rather not there is no reason either why i should as you probably will never have much to do with me still i should like to know you can inquire at my aunt's she will tell you my name is gabriel oak and mine isn't you seem fond of yours in speaking it so decisively gabriel oak you see it is the only one i shall ever have and i must make the most of it i always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable i should think you might soon get a new one mercy how many opinions you keep about you concerning other people gabriel oak well miss excuse the words i thought you would like them but i can't match you i know in mapping out my mind upon my tongue i never was very clever in my inside but i thank you come give me your hand she hesitated somewhat disconcerted at oak's old fashioned earnest conclusion to a dialogue lightly carried on very well she said and gave him her hand compressing her lips to a demure impassivity he held it but an instant and in his fear of being too demonstrative swerved to the opposite extreme touching her fingers with the lightness of a small hearted person i am sorry he said the instant after what for letting your hand go so quick you may have it again if you like there it is she gave him her hand again oak held it longer this time indeed curiously long how soft it is being winter time too not chapped or rough or anything he said there that's long enough said she though without pulling it away but i suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it you may if you want to i wasn't thinking of any such thing said gabriel simply but i will that you won't she snatched back her hand gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact now find out my name she said teasingly and withdrew chapter iv gabriel's resolve the visit the mistake the only superiority in women that is tolerable to the rival sex is as a rule that of the unconscious kind but a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the subordinated man this well favoured and comely girl soon made appreciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young farmer oak love being an extremely exacting usurer a sense of exorbitant profit spiritually by an exchange of hearts being at the bottom of pure passions as that of exorbitant profit bodily or materially is at the bottom of those of lower atmosphere every morning oak's feelings were as sensitive as the money market in calculations upon his chances his dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in which oak waited for the girl's presence that the farmer was quite struck with the resemblance felt it lowering and would not look at the dog however he continued to watch through the hedge for her regular coming and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened without any corresponding effect being produced upon herself oak had nothing finished and ready to say as yet and not being able to frame love phrases which end where they begin passionate tales full of sound and fury signifying nothing he said no word at all by making inquiries he found that the girl's name was bathsheba everdene and that the cow would go dry in about seven days he dreaded the eighth day at last the eighth day came the cow had ceased to give milk for that year and bathsheba everdene came up the hill no more gabriel had reached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a short time before he liked saying bathsheba as a private enjoyment instead of whistling turned over his taste to black hair though he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy isolated himself till the space he filled in the public eye was contemptibly small love is a possible strength in an actual weakness marriage transforms a distraction into a support the power of which should be and happily often is in direct proportion to the degree of imbecility it supplants oak began now to see light in this direction and said to himself i'll make her my wife or upon my soul i shall be good for nothing all this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage of bathsheba's aunt he found his opportunity in the death of a ewe mother of a living lamb on a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution a fine january morning when there was just enough blue sky visible to make cheerfully disposed people wish for more and an occasional gleam of silvery sunshine oak put the lamb into a respectable sunday basket and stalked across the fields to the house of mrs hurst the aunt george the dog walking behind with a countenance of great concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking gabriel had watched the blue wood smoke curling from the chimney with strange meditation at evening he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the spot of its origin seen the hearth and bathsheba beside it beside it in her out door dress for the clothes she had worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included in the compass of his affection they seemed at this early time of his love a necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called bathsheba everdene he had made a toilet of a nicely adjusted kind of a nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly ornate of a degree between fine market day and wet sunday selection he thoroughly cleaned his silver watch chain with whiting put new lacing straps to his boots looked to the brass eyelet holes went to the inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking stick and trimmed it vigorously on his way back took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes box put on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects of either and used all the hair oil he possessed upon his usually dry sandy and inextricably curly hair till he had deepened it to a splendidly novel colour between that of guano and roman cement making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg or wet seaweed round a boulder after the ebb nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves one might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of those under them it seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one for as the rather untoward commencement of oak's overtures just as he arrived by the garden gate he saw a cat inside going into various arched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog george the dog took no notice for he had arrived at an age at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath in fact he never barked even at the sheep except to order when it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance as a sort of commination service which though offensive had to be gone through once now and then to frighten the flock for their own good a voice came from behind some laurel bushes into which the cat had run poor dear did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it did he poor dear i beg your pardon said oak to the voice but george was walking on behind me with a temper as mild as milk almost before he had ceased speaking oak was seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient of his answer nobody appeared and he heard the person retreat among the bushes gabriel meditated and so deeply that he brought small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of reverie where the issue of an interview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better any initial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of failure oak went up to the door a little abashed his mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of opening bathsheba's aunt was indoors will you tell miss everdene that somebody would be glad to speak to her said mr oak calling one's self merely somebody without giving a name is not to be taken as an example of the ill breeding of the rural world it springs from a refined modesty of which townspeople with their cards and announcements have no notion whatever bathsheba was out the voice had evidently been hers will you come in mr oak oh thank ee said gabriel following her to the fireplace i've brought a lamb for"
