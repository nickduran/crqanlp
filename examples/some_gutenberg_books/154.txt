"1" "from brandon the brandon's a good paint said lapham conscientiously like to show you round up at our place some odd time if you get off thanks i should like it first rate works there yes works there well sir just about the time i got started the war broke out and it knocked my paint higher than a kite the thing dropped perfectly dead i presume that if i'd had any sort of influence i might have got it into government hands for gun carriages and army wagons and may be on board government vessels but i hadn't and we had to face the music i was about broken hearted but m'wife she looked at it another way i guess it's a providence says she silas i guess you've got a country that's worth fighting for any rate you better go out and give it a chance well sir i went i knew she meant business it might kill her to have me go but it would kill her sure if i stayed she was one of that kind i went her last words was i'll look after the paint si we hadn't but just one little girl then boy'd died and mis lapham's mother was livin with us and i knew if times did anyways come up again m'wife'd know just what to do so i went i got through and you can call me colonel if you want to feel there lapham took bartley's thumb and forefinger and put them on a bunch in his leg just above the knee anything hard ball lapham nodded gettysburg that's my thermometer if it wa'n't for that i shouldn't know enough to come in when it rains bartley laughed at a joke which betrayed some evidences of wear and when you came back you took hold of the paint and rushed it i took hold of the paint and rushed it all i could said lapham with less satisfaction than he had hitherto shown in his autobiography but i found that i had got back to another world the day of small things was past and i don't suppose it will ever come again in this country my wife was at me all the time to take a partner somebody with capital but i couldn't seem to bear the idea that paint was like my own blood to me to have anybody else concerned in it was like well i don't know what i saw it was the thing to do but i tried to fight it off and i tried to joke it off i used to say why didn't you take a partner yourself persis while i was away and she'd say well if you hadn't come back i should si always did like a joke about as well as any woman i ever saw well i had to come to it i took a partner lapham dropped the bold blue eyes with which he had been till now staring into bartley's face and the reporter knew that here was a place for asterisks in his interview if interviews were faithful he had money enough continued lapham with a suppressed sigh but he didn't know anything about paint we hung on together for a year or two and then we quit and he had the experience suggested bartley with companionable ease i had some of the experience too said lapham with a scowl and bartley divined through the freemasonry of all who have sore places in their memories that this was a point which he must not touch again and since that i suppose you've played it alone i've played it alone you must ship some of this paint of yours to foreign countries colonel suggested bartley putting on a professional air we ship it to all parts of the world it goes to south america lots of it it goes to australia and it goes to india and it goes to china and it goes to the cape of good hope it'll stand any climate of course we don't export these fancy brands much they're for home use but we're introducing them elsewhere here lapham pulled open a drawer and showed bartley a lot of labels in different languages spanish french german and italian we expect to do a good business in all those countries we've got our agencies in cadiz now and in paris and in hamburg and in leghorn it's a thing that's bound to make its way yes sir wherever a man has got a ship or a bridge or a lock or a house or a car or a fence or a pig pen anywhere in god's universe to paint that's the paint for him and he's bound to find it out sooner or later you pass a ton of that paint dry through a blast furnace and you'll get a quarter of a ton of pig iron i believe in my paint i believe it's a blessing to the world when folks come in and kind of smell round and ask me what i mix it with i always say well in the first place i mix it with faith and after that i grind it up with the best quality of boiled linseed oil that money will buy lapham took out his watch and looked at it and bartley perceived that his audience was drawing to a close f you ever want to run down and take a look at our works pass you over the road he called it rud and it sha'n't cost you a cent well may be i shall sometime said bartley good afternoon colonel good afternoon or hold on my horse down there yet william he called to the young man in the counting room who had taken his letter at the beginning of the interview oh all right he added in response to something the young man said can't i set you down somewhere mr hubbard i've got my horse at the door and i can drop you on my way home i'm going to take mis lapham to look at a house i'm driving piles for down on the new land don't care if i do said bartley lapham put on a straw hat gathered up some papers lying on his desk pulled down its rolling cover turned the key in it and gave the papers to an extremely handsome young woman at one of the desks in the outer office she was stylishly dressed as bartley saw and her smooth yellow hair was sculpturesquely waved over a low white forehead here said lapham with the same prompt gruff kindness that he had used in addressing the young man i want you should put these in shape and give me a type writer copy to morrow what an uncommonly pretty girl said bartley as they descended the rough stairway and found their way out to the street past the dangling rope of a block and tackle wandering up into the cavernous darkness overhead she does her work said lapham shortly bartley mounted to the left side of the open buggy standing at the curb stone and lapham gathering up the hitching weight slid it under the buggy seat and mounted beside him no chance to speed a horse here of course said lapham while the horse with a spirited gentleness picked her way with a high long action over the pavement of the street the streets were all narrow and most of them crooked in that quarter of the town but at the end of one the spars of a vessel pencilled themselves delicately against the cool blue of the afternoon sky the air was full of a smell pleasantly compounded of oakum of leather and of oil it was not the busy season and they met only two or three trucks heavily straggling toward the wharf with their long string teams but the cobble stones of the pavement were worn with the dint of ponderous wheels and discoloured with iron rust from them here and there in wandering streaks over its surface was the grey stain of the salt water with which the street had been sprinkled after an interval of some minutes which both men spent in looking round the dash board from opposite sides to watch the stride of the horse bartley said with a light sigh i had a colt once down in maine that stepped just like that mare well said lapham sympathetically recognising the bond that this fact created between them well now i tell you what you do you let me come for you most any afternoon now and take you out over the milldam and speed this mare a little i'd like to show you what this mare can do yes i would all right answered bartley i'll let you know my first day off good cried lapham kentucky queried bartley no sir i don't ride behind anything but vermont never did touch of morgan of course but you can't have much morgan in a horse if you want speed hambletonian mostly where'd you say you wanted to get out i guess you may put me down at the events office just round the corner here i've got to write up this interview while it's fresh all right said lapham impersonally assenting to bartley's use of him as material he had not much to complain of in bartley's treatment unless it was the strain of extravagant compliment which it involved but the flattery was mainly for the paint whose virtues lapham did not believe could be overstated and himself and his history had been treated with as much respect as bartley was capable of showing any one he made a very picturesque thing of the discovery of the paint mine deep in the heart of the virgin forests of vermont far up toward the line of the canadian snows on a desolate mountain side where an autumnal storm had done its wild work and the great trees strewn hither and thither bore witness to its violence nehemiah lapham discovered just forty years ago the mineral which the alchemy of his son's enterprise and energy has transmuted into solid ingots of the most precious of metals the colossal fortune of colonel silas lapham lay at the bottom of a hole which an uprooted tree had dug for him and which for many years remained a paint mine of no more appreciable value than a soap mine here bartley had not been able to forego another grin but he compensated for it by the high reverence with which he spoke of colonel lapham's record during the war of the rebellion and of the motives which impelled him to turn aside from an enterprise in which his whole heart was engaged and take part in the struggle the colonel bears embedded in the muscle of his right leg a little memento of the period in the shape of a minie ball which he jocularly referred to as his thermometer and which relieves him from the necessity of reading the probabilities in his morning paper this saves him just so much time and for a man who as he said has not a moment of waste time on him anywhere five minutes a day are something in the course of a year simple clear bold and straightforward in mind and action colonel silas lapham with a prompt comprehensiveness and a never failing business sagacity is in the best sense of that much abused term one of nature's noblemen to the last inch of his five eleven and a half his life affords an example of single minded application and unwavering perseverance which our young business men would do well to emulate there is nothing showy or meretricious about the man he believes in mineral paint and he puts his heart and soul into it he makes it a religion though we would not imply that it is his religion colonel lapham is a regular attendant at the rev dr langworthy's church he subscribes liberally to the associated charities and no good object or worthy public enterprise fails to receive his support he is not now actively in politics and his paint is not partisan but it is an open secret that he is and always has been a staunch republican without violating the sanctities of private life we cannot speak fully of various details which came out in the free and unembarrassed interview which colonel lapham accorded our representative but we may say that the success of which he is justly proud he is also proud to attribute in great measure to the sympathy and energy of his wife one of those women who in whatever walk of life seem born to honour the name of american woman and to redeem it from the national reproach of daisy millerism of colonel lapham's family we will simply add that it consists of two young lady daughters the subject of this very inadequate sketch is building a house on the water side of beacon street after designs by one of our leading architectural firms which when complete will be one of the finest ornaments of that exclusive avenue it will we believe be ready for the occupancy of the family sometime in the spring when bartley had finished his article which he did with a good deal of inward derision he went home to marcia still smiling over the thought of lapham whose burly simplicity had peculiarly amused him he regularly turned himself inside out to me he said as he sat describing his interview to marcia then i know you could make something nice out of it said his wife and that will please mr witherby oh yes i've done pretty well but i couldn't let myself loose on him the way i wanted to confound the limitations of decency anyway i should like to have told just what colonel lapham thought of landscape advertising in colonel lapham's own words i'll tell you one thing marsh he had a girl there at one of the desks that you wouldn't let me have within gunshot of my office pretty it ain't any name for it marcia's eyes began to blaze and bartley broke out into a laugh in which he arrested himself at sight of a formidable parcel in the corner of the room hello what's that why i don't know what it is replied marcia tremulously a man brought it just before you came in and i didn't like to open it think it was some kind of infernal machine asked bartley getting down on his knees to examine the package mrs b hubbard heigh he cut the heavy hemp string with his penknife we must look into this thing i should like to know who's sending packages to mrs hubbard in my absence he unfolded the wrappings of paper growing softer and finer inward and presently pulled out a handsome square glass jar through which a crimson mass showed richly the persis brand he yelled i knew it oh what is it bartley quavered marcia then courageously drawing a little nearer is it some kind of jam she implored jam no roared bartley it's paint it's mineral paint lapham's paint paint echoed marcia as she stood over him while he stripped their wrappings from the jars which showed the dark blue dark green light brown dark brown and black with the dark crimson forming the gamut of colour of the lapham paint don't tell me it's paint that i can use bartley well i shouldn't advise you to use much of it all at once replied her husband but it's paint that you can use in moderation marcia cast her arms round his neck and kissed him o bartley i think i'm the happiest girl in the world i was just wondering what i should do there are places in that clover street house that need touching up so dreadfully i shall be very careful you needn't be afraid i shall overdo but this just saves my life did you buy it bartley you know we couldn't afford it and you oughtn't to have done it and what does the persis brand mean buy it cried bartley no the old fool's sent it to you as a present you'd better wait for the facts before you pitch into me for extravagance marcia persis is the name of his wife and he named it after her because it's his finest brand you'll see it in my interview put it on the market her last birthday for a surprise to her what old fool faltered marcia why lapham the mineral paint man oh what a good man sighed marcia from the bottom of her soul bartley you won't make fun of him as you do of some of those people will you nothing that he'll ever find out said bartley getting up and brushing off the carpet lint from his knees ii after dropping bartley hubbard at the events building lapham drove on down washington street to nankeen square at the south end where he had lived ever since the mistaken movement of society in that direction ceased he had not built but had bought very cheap of a terrified gentleman of good extraction who discovered too late that the south end was not the thing and who in the eagerness of his flight to the back bay threw in his carpets and shades for almost nothing mrs lapham was even better satisfied with their bargain than the colonel himself and they had lived in nankeen square for twelve years they had seen the saplings planted in the pretty oval round which the houses were built flourish up into sturdy young trees and their two little girls in the same period had grown into young ladies the colonel's tough frame had expanded into the bulk which bartley's interview indicated and mrs lapham while keeping a more youthful outline showed the sharp print of the crow's foot at the corners of her motherly eyes and certain slight creases in her wholesome cheeks the fact that they lived in an unfashionable neighbourhood was something that they had never been made to feel to their personal disadvantage and they had hardly known it till the summer before this story opens when mrs lapham and her daughter irene had met some other bostonians far from boston who made it memorable they were people whom chance had brought for the time under a singular obligation to the lapham ladies and they were gratefully recognisant of it they had ventured a mother and two daughters as far as a rather wild little canadian watering place on the st lawrence below quebec and had arrived some days before their son and brother was expected to join them two of their trunks had gone astray and on the night of their arrival the mother was taken violently ill mrs lapham came to their help with her skill as nurse and with the abundance of her own and her daughter's wardrobe and a profuse single hearted kindness when a doctor could be got at he said that but for mrs lapham's timely care the lady would hardly have lived he was a very effusive little frenchman and fancied he was saying something very pleasant to everybody a certain intimacy inevitably followed and when the son came he was even more grateful than the others mrs lapham could not quite understand why he should be as attentive to her as to irene but she compared him with other young men about the place and thought him nicer than any of them she had not the means of a wider comparison for in boston with all her husband's prosperity they had not had a social life their first years there were given to careful getting on lapham's part and careful saving on his wife's suddenly the money began to come so abundantly that she need not save and then they did not know what to do with it a certain amount could be spent on horses and lapham spent it his wife spent on rich and rather ugly clothes and a luxury of household appointments lapham had not yet reached the picture buying stage of the rich man's development but they decorated their house with the costliest and most abominable frescoes they went upon journeys and lavished upon cars and hotels they gave with both hands to their church and to all the charities it brought them acquainted with but they did not know how to spend on society up to a certain period mrs lapham had the ladies of her neighbourhood in to tea as her mother had done in the country in her younger days lapham's idea of hospitality was still to bring a heavy buying customer home to pot luck neither of them imagined dinners their two girls had gone to the public schools where they had not got on as fast as some of the other girls so that they were a year behind in graduating from the grammar school where lapham thought that they had got education enough his wife was of a different mind she would have liked them to go to some private school for their finishing but irene did not care for study she preferred house keeping and both the sisters were afraid of being snubbed by the other girls who were of a different sort from the girls of the grammar school these were mostly from the parks and squares like themselves it ended in their going part of a year but the elder had an odd taste of her own for reading and she took some private lessons and read books out of the circulating library the whole family were amazed at the number she read and rather proud of it they were not girls who embroidered or abandoned themselves to needle work irene spent her abundant leisure in shopping for herself and her mother of whom both daughters made a kind of idol buying her caps and laces out of their pin money and getting her dresses far beyond her capacity to wear irene dressed herself very stylishly and spent hours on her toilet every day her sister had a simpler taste and if she had done altogether as she liked might even have slighted dress they all three took long naps every day and sat hours together minutely discussing what they saw out of the window in her self guided search for self improvement the elder sister went to many church lectures on a vast variety of secular subjects and usually came home with a comic account of them and that made more matter of talk for the whole family she could make fun of nearly everything irene complained that she scared away the young men whom they got acquainted with at the dancing school sociables they were perhaps not the wisest young men the girls had learned to dance at papanti's but they had not belonged to the private classes they did not even know of them and a great gulf divided them from those who did their father did not like company except such as came informally in their way and their mother had remained too rustic to know how to attract it in the sophisticated city fashion none of them had grasped the idea of european travel but they had gone about to mountain and sea side resorts the mother and the two girls where they witnessed the spectacle which such resorts present throughout new england of multitudes of girls lovely accomplished exquisitely dressed humbly glad of the presence of any sort of young man but the laphams had no skill or courage to make themselves noticed far less courted by the solitary invalid or clergyman or artist they lurked helplessly about in the hotel parlours looking on and not knowing how to put themselves forward perhaps they did not care a great deal to do so they had not a conceit of themselves but a sort of content in their own ways that one may notice in certain families the very strength of their mutual affection was a barrier to worldly knowledge they dressed for one another they equipped their house for their own satisfaction they lived richly to themselves not because they were selfish but because they did not know how to do otherwise the elder daughter did not care for society apparently the younger who was but three years younger was not yet quite old enough to be ambitious of it with all her wonderful beauty she had an innocence almost vegetable when her beauty which in its immaturity was crude and harsh suddenly ripened she bloomed and glowed with the unconsciousness of a flower she not merely did not feel herself admired but hardly knew herself discovered if she dressed well perhaps too well it was because she had the instinct of dress but till she met this young man who was so nice to her at baie st paul she had scarcely lived a detached individual life so wholly had she depended on her mother and her sister for her opinions almost her sensations she took account of everything he did and said pondering it and trying to make out exactly what he meant to the inflection of a syllable the slightest movement or gesture in this way she began for the first time to form ideas which she had not derived from her family and they were none the less her own because they were often mistaken some of the things that he partly said partly looked she reported to her mother and they talked them over as they did everything relating to these new acquaintances and wrought them into the novel point of view which they were acquiring when mrs lapham returned home she submitted all the accumulated facts of the case and all her own conjectures to her husband and canvassed them anew at first he was disposed to regard the whole affair as of small importance and she had to insist a little beyond her own convictions in order to counteract his indifference well i can tell you she said that if you think they were not the nicest people you ever saw you're mightily mistaken they had about the best manners and they had been everywhere and knew everything i declare it made me feel as if we had always lived in the backwoods i don't know but the mother and the daughters would have let you feel so a little if they'd showed out all they thought but they never did and the son well i can't express it silas but that young man had about perfect ways seem struck up on irene asked the colonel how can i tell he seemed just about as much struck up on me anyway he paid me as much attention as he did her perhaps it's more the way now to notice the mother than it used to be lapham ventured no conjecture but asked as he had asked already who the people were mrs lapham repeated their name lapham nodded his head do you know them what business is he in i guess he ain't in anything said lapham they were very nice said mrs lapham impartially well they'd ought to be returned the colonel never done anything else they didn't seem stuck up urged his wife they'd no need to with you i could buy him and sell him twice over this answer satisfied mrs lapham rather with the fact than with her husband well i guess i wouldn't brag silas she said in the winter the ladies of this family who returned to town very late came to call on mrs lapham they were again very polite but the mother let drop in apology for their calling almost at nightfall that the coachman had not known the way exactly nearly all our friends are on the new land or on the hill there was a barb in this that rankled after the ladies had gone and on comparing notes with her daughter mrs lapham found that a barb had been left to rankle in her mind also they said they had never been in this part of the town before upon a strict search of her memory irene could not report that the fact had been stated with anything like insinuation but it was that which gave it a more penetrating effect oh well of course said lapham to whom these facts were referred those sort of people haven't got much business up our way and they don't come it's a fair thing all round we don't trouble the hill or the new land much we know where they are suggested his wife thoughtfully yes assented the colonel i know where they are i've got a lot of land over on the back bay you have eagerly demanded his wife want me to build on it he asked in reply with a quizzical smile i guess we can get along here for a while this was at night in the morning mrs lapham said i suppose we ought to do the best we can for the children in every way i supposed we always had replied her husband yes we have according to our light have you got some new light i don't know as it's light but if the girls are going to keep on living in boston and marry here i presume we ought to try to get them into society some way or ought to do something well who's ever done more for their children than we have demanded lapham with a pang at the thought that he could possibly have been out done don't"
