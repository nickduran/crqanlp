"1" "is not after all a comanche savage she is a young lady said mrs costello who has an intimacy with her mamma's courier an intimacy with the courier the young man demanded oh the mother is just as bad they treat the courier like a familiar friend like a gentleman i shouldn't wonder if he dines with them very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners such fine clothes so like a gentleman he probably corresponds to the young lady's idea of a count he sits with them in the garden in the evening i think he smokes winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures they helped him to make up his mind about miss daisy evidently she was rather wild well he said i am not a courier and yet she was very charming to me you had better have said at first said mrs costello with dignity that you had made her acquaintance we simply met in the garden and we talked a bit tout bonnement and pray what did you say i said i should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt i am much obliged to you it was to guarantee my respectability said winterbourne and pray who is to guarantee hers ah you are cruel said the young man she's a very nice young girl you don't say that as if you believed it mrs costello observed she is completely uncultivated winterbourne went on but she is wonderfully pretty and in short she is very nice to prove that i believe it i am going to take her to the chateau de chillon you two are going off there together i should say it proved just the contrary how long had you known her may i ask when this interesting project was formed you haven't been twenty four hours in the house i have known her half an hour said winterbourne smiling dear me cried mrs costello what a dreadful girl her nephew was silent for some moments you really think then he began earnestly and with a desire for trustworthy information you really think that but he paused again think what sir said his aunt that she is the sort of young lady who expects a man sooner or later to carry her off i haven't the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do but i really think that you had better not meddle with little american girls that are uncultivated as you call them you have lived too long out of the country you will be sure to make some great mistake you are too innocent my dear aunt i am not so innocent said winterbourne smiling and curling his mustache you are guilty too then winterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively you won't let the poor girl know you then he asked at last is it literally true that she is going to the chateau de chillon with you i think that she fully intends it then my dear frederick said mrs costello i must decline the honor of her acquaintance i am an old woman but i am not too old thank heaven to be shocked but don't they all do these things the young girls in america winterbourne inquired mrs costello stared a moment i should like to see my granddaughters do them she declared grimly this seemed to throw some light upon the matter for winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in new york were tremendous flirts if therefore miss daisy miller exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies it was probable that anything might be expected of her winterbourne was impatient to see her again and he was vexed with himself that by instinct he should not appreciate her justly though he was impatient to see her he hardly knew what he should say to her about his aunt's refusal to become acquainted with her but he discovered promptly enough that with miss daisy miller there was no great need of walking on tiptoe he found her that evening in the garden wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph and swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld it was ten o'clock he had dined with his aunt had been sitting with her since dinner and had just taken leave of her till the morrow miss daisy miller seemed very glad to see him she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed have you been all alone he asked i have been walking round with mother but mother gets tired walking round she answered has she gone to bed no she doesn't like to go to bed said the young girl she doesn't sleep not three hours she says she doesn't know how she lives she's dreadfully nervous i guess she sleeps more than she thinks she's gone somewhere after randolph she wants to try to get him to go to bed he doesn't like to go to bed let us hope she will persuade him observed winterbourne she will talk to him all she can but he doesn't like her to talk to him said miss daisy opening her fan she's going to try to get eugenio to talk to him but he isn't afraid of eugenio eugenio's a splendid courier but he can't make much impression on randolph i don't believe he'll go to bed before eleven it appeared that randolph's vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged for winterbourne strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother i have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to his companion resumed she's your aunt then on winterbourne's admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it she said she had heard all about mrs costello from the chambermaid she was very quiet and very comme il faut she wore white puffs she spoke to no one and she never dined at the table d'hote every two days she had a headache i think that's a lovely description headache and all said miss daisy chattering along in her thin gay voice i want to know her ever so much i know just what your aunt would be i know i should like her she would be very exclusive i like a lady to be exclusive i'm dying to be exclusive myself well we are exclusive mother and i we don't speak to everyone or they don't speak to us i suppose it's about the same thing anyway i shall be ever so glad to know your aunt winterbourne was embarrassed she would be most happy he said but i am afraid those headaches will interfere the young girl looked at him through the dusk but i suppose she doesn't have a headache every day she said sympathetically winterbourne was silent a moment she tells me she does he answered at last not knowing what to say miss daisy miller stopped and stood looking at him her prettiness was still visible in the darkness she was opening and closing her enormous fan she doesn't want to know me she said suddenly why don't you say so you needn't be afraid i'm not afraid and she gave a little laugh winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice he was touched shocked mortified by it my dear young lady he protested she knows no one it's her wretched health the young girl walked on a few steps laughing still you needn't be afraid she repeated why should she want to know me then she paused again she was close to the parapet of the garden and in front of her was the starlit lake there was a vague sheen upon its surface and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms daisy miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh gracious she is exclusive she said winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her he had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes he felt then for the instant quite ready to sacrifice his aunt conversationally to admit that she was a proud rude woman and to declare that they needn't mind her but before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety the young lady resuming her walk gave an exclamation in quite another tone well here's mother i guess she hasn't got randolph to go to bed the figure of a lady appeared at a distance very indistinct in the darkness and advancing with a slow and wavering movement suddenly it seemed to pause are you sure it is your mother can you distinguish her in this thick dusk winterbourne asked well cried miss daisy miller with a laugh i guess i know my own mother and when she has got on my shawl too she is always wearing my things the lady in question ceasing to advance hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps i am afraid your mother doesn't see you said winterbourne or perhaps he added thinking with miss miller the joke permissible perhaps she feels guilty about your shawl oh it's a fearful old thing the young girl replied serenely i told her she could wear it she won't come here because she sees you ah then said winterbourne i had better leave you oh no come on urged miss daisy miller i'm afraid your mother doesn't approve of my walking with you miss miller gave him a serious glance it isn't for me it's for you that is it's for her well i don't know who it's for but mother doesn't like any of my gentlemen friends she's right down timid she always makes a fuss if i introduce a gentleman but i do introduce them almost always if i didn't introduce my gentlemen friends to mother the young girl added in her little soft flat monotone i shouldn't think i was natural to introduce me said winterbourne you must know my name and he proceeded to pronounce it oh dear i can't say all that said his companion with a laugh but by this time they had come up to mrs miller who as they drew near walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them mother said the young girl in a tone of decision upon this the elder lady turned round mr winterbourne said miss daisy miller introducing the young man very frankly and prettily common she was as mrs costello had pronounced her yet it was a wonder to winterbourne that with her commonness she had a singularly delicate grace her mother was a small spare light person with a wandering eye a very exiguous nose and a large forehead decorated with a certain amount of thin much frizzled hair like her daughter mrs miller was dressed with extreme elegance she had enormous diamonds in her ears so far as winterbourne could observe she gave him no greeting she certainly was not looking at him daisy was near her pulling her shawl straight what are you doing poking round here this young lady inquired but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply i don't know said her mother turning toward the lake again i shouldn't think you'd want that shawl daisy exclaimed well i do her mother answered with a little laugh did you get randolph to go to bed asked the young girl no i couldn't induce him said mrs miller very gently he wants to talk to the waiter he likes to talk to that waiter i was telling mr winterbourne the young girl went on and to the young man's ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life oh yes said winterbourne i have the pleasure of knowing your son randolph's mamma was silent she turned her attention to the lake but at last she spoke well i don't see how he lives anyhow it isn't so bad as it was at dover said daisy miller and what occurred at dover winterbourne asked he wouldn't go to bed at all i guess he sat up all night in the public parlor he wasn't in bed at twelve o'clock i know that it was half past twelve declared mrs miller with mild emphasis does he sleep much during the day winterbourne demanded i guess he doesn't sleep much daisy rejoined i wish he would said her mother it seems as if he couldn't i think he's real tiresome daisy pursued then for some moments there was silence well daisy miller said the elder lady presently i shouldn't think you'd want to talk against your own brother well he is tiresome mother said daisy quite without the asperity of a retort he's only nine urged mrs miller well he wouldn't go to that castle said the young girl i'm going there with mr winterbourne to this announcement very placidly made daisy's mamma offered no response winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion but he said to himself that she was a simple easily managed person and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure yes he began your daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide mrs miller's wandering eyes attached themselves with a sort of appealing air to daisy who however strolled a few steps farther gently humming to herself i presume you will go in the cars said her mother yes or in the boat said winterbourne well of course i don't know mrs miller rejoined i have never been to that castle it is a pity you shouldn't go said winterbourne beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition and yet he was quite prepared to find that as a matter of course she meant to accompany her daughter we've been thinking ever so much about going she pursued but it seems as if we couldn't of course daisy she wants to go round but there's a lady here i don't know her name she says she shouldn't think we'd want to go to see castles here she should think we'd want to wait till we got to italy it seems as if there would be so many there continued mrs miller with an air of increasing confidence of course we only want to see the principal ones we visited several in england she presently added ah yes in england there are beautiful castles said winterbourne but chillon here is very well worth seeing well if daisy feels up to it said mrs miller in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise it seems as if there was nothing she wouldn't undertake oh i think she'll enjoy it winterbourne declared and he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a tete a tete with the young lady who was still strolling along in front of them softly vocalizing you are not disposed madam he inquired to undertake it yourself daisy's mother looked at him an instant askance and then walked forward in silence then i guess she had better go alone she said simply winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake but his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by mrs miller's unprotected daughter mr winterbourne murmured daisy mademoiselle said the young man don't you want to take me out in a boat at present he asked of course said daisy well annie miller exclaimed her mother i beg you madam to let her go said winterbourne ardently for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl i shouldn't think she'd want to said her mother i should think she'd rather go indoors i'm sure mr winterbourne wants to take me daisy declared he's so awfully devoted i will row you over to chillon in the starlight i don't believe it said daisy well ejaculated the elder lady again you haven't spoken to me for half an hour her daughter went on i have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother said winterbourne well i want you to take me out in a boat daisy repeated they had all stopped and she had turned round and was looking at winterbourne her face wore a charming smile her pretty eyes were gleaming she was swinging her great fan about no it's impossible to be prettier than that thought winterbourne there are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place he said pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake if you will do me the honor to accept my arm we will go and select one of them daisy stood there smiling she threw back her head and gave a little light laugh i like a gentleman to be formal she declared i assure you it's a formal offer i was bound i would make you say something daisy went on you see it's not very difficult said winterbourne but i am afraid you are chaffing me i think not sir remarked mrs miller very gently do then let me give you a row he said to the young girl it's quite lovely the way you say that cried daisy it will be still more lovely to do it yes it would be lovely said daisy but she made no movement to accompany him she only stood there laughing i should think you had better find out what time it is interposed her mother it is eleven o'clock madam said a voice with a foreign accent out of the neighboring darkness and winterbourne turning perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies he had apparently just approached oh eugenio said daisy i am going out in a boat eugenio bowed at eleven o'clock mademoiselle i am going with mr winterbourne this very minute do tell her she can't said mrs miller to the courier i think you had better not go out in a boat mademoiselle eugenio declared winterbourne wished to heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier but he said nothing i suppose you don't think it's proper daisy exclaimed eugenio doesn't think anything's proper i am at your service said winterbourne does mademoiselle propose to go alone asked eugenio of mrs miller oh no with this gentleman answered daisy's mamma the courier looked for a moment at winterbourne the latter thought he was smiling and then solemnly with a bow as mademoiselle pleases he said oh i hoped you would make a fuss said daisy i don't care to go now i myself shall make a fuss if you don't go said winterbourne that's all i want a little fuss and the young girl began to laugh again mr randolph has gone to bed the courier announced frigidly oh daisy now we can go said mrs miller daisy turned away from winterbourne looking at him smiling and fanning herself good night she said i hope you are disappointed or disgusted or something he looked at her taking the hand she offered him i am puzzled he answered well i hope it won't keep you awake she said very smartly and under the escort of the privileged eugenio the two ladies passed toward the house winterbourne stood looking after them he was indeed puzzled he lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour turning over the mystery of the young girl's sudden familiarities and caprices but the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly going off with her somewhere two days afterward he went off with her to the castle of chillon he waited for her in the large hall of the hotel where the couriers the servants the foreign tourists were lounging about and staring it was not the place he should have chosen but she had appointed it she came tripping downstairs buttoning her long gloves squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume winterbourne was a man of imagination and as our ancestors used to say sensibility as he looked at her dress and on the great staircase her little rapid confiding step he felt as if there were something romantic going forward he could have believed he was going to elope with her he passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there they were all looking at her very hard she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him winterbourne's preference had been that they should be conveyed to chillon in a carriage but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer she declared that she had a passion for steamboats there was always such a lovely breeze upon the water and you saw such lots of people the sail was not long but winterbourne's companion found time to say a great many things to the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapade an adventure that even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way but it must be confessed that in this particular he was disappointed daisy miller was extremely animated she was in charming spirits but she was apparently not at all excited she was not fluttered she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her people continued to look at her a great deal and winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty companion's distinguished air he had been a little afraid that she would talk loud laugh overmuch and even perhaps desire to move about the boat a good deal but he quite forgot his fears he sat smiling with his eyes upon her face while without moving from her place she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections it was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard he had assented to the idea that she was common but was she so after all or was he simply getting used to her commonness her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast but every now and then it took a subjective turn what on earth are you so grave about she suddenly demanded fixing her agreeable eyes upon winterbourne's am i grave he asked i had an idea i was grinning from ear to ear you look as if you were taking me to a funeral if that's a grin your ears are very near together should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck pray do and i'll carry round your hat it will pay the expenses of our journey i never was better pleased in my life murmured winterbourne she looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh i like to make you say those things you're a queer mixture in the castle after they had landed the subjective element decidedly prevailed daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes and turned a singularly well shaped ear to everything that winterbourne told her about the place but he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of chillon made but a slight impression upon her they had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian and winterbourne arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried that they should linger and pause wherever they chose the custodian interpreted the bargain generously winterbourne on his side had been generous and ended by leaving them quite to themselves miss miller's observations were not remarkable for logical consistency for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext she found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of chillon for asking winterbourne sudden questions about himself his family his previous history his tastes his habits his intentions and for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality of her own tastes habits and intentions miss miller was prepared to give the most definite and indeed the most favorable account well i hope you know enough she said to her companion after he had told her the history of the unhappy bonivard i never saw a man that knew so much the history of bonivard had evidently as they say gone into one ear and out of the other but daisy went on to say that she wished winterbourne would travel with them and go round with them they might know something in that case don't you want to come and teach randolph she asked winterbourne said that nothing could possibly please him so much but that he had unfortunately other occupations other occupations i don't believe it said miss daisy what do you mean you are not in business the young man admitted that he was not in business but he had engagements which even within a day or two would force him to go back to geneva oh bother she said i don't believe it and she began to talk about something else but a few moments later when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace she broke out irrelevantly you don't mean to say you are going back to geneva it is a melancholy fact that i shall have to return to geneva tomorrow well mr winterbourne said daisy i think you're horrid oh don't say such dreadful things said winterbourne just at the last the last cried the young girl i call it the first i have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone and for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid poor winterbourne was fairly bewildered no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements his companion after this ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of chillon or the beauties of the lake she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see how did miss daisy miller know that there was a charmer in geneva winterbourne who denied the existence of such a person was quite unable to discover and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage she seemed to him in all this an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity does she never allow you more than three days at a time asked daisy ironically doesn't she give you a vacation in summer there's no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season i suppose if you stay another day she'll come after you in the boat do wait over till friday and i will go down to the landing to see her arrive winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked if he had missed the personal accent the personal accent was now making its appearance it sounded very distinctly at last in her telling him she would stop teasing him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to rome in the winter that's not a difficult promise to make said winterbourne my aunt has taken an apartment in rome for the winter and has already asked me to come and see her i don't want you to come for your aunt said daisy i want you to come for me and this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman he declared that at any rate he would certainly come after this daisy stopped teasing winterbourne took a carriage and they drove back to vevey in the dusk the young girl was very quiet in the evening winterbourne mentioned to mrs costello that he had spent the afternoon at chillon with miss daisy miller the americans of the courier asked this lady ah happily said winterbourne the courier stayed at home she went with you all alone all alone mrs costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle and that she exclaimed is the young person whom you wanted me to know part ii winterbourne who had returned to geneva the day after his excursion to chillon went to rome toward the end of january his aunt had been established there for several weeks and he had received a couple of letters from her those people you were so devoted to last summer at vevey have turned up here courier and all she wrote they seem to have"
