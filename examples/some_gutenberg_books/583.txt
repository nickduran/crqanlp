"1" "my sister reminded me that this gentleman had expressly placed his services at my disposal during the present season in case i wished to leave town my mother seriously appealed to me not to let an idle caprice stand in the way of my own interests and my own health and pesca piteously entreated that i would not wound him to the heart by rejecting the first grateful offer of service that he had been able to make to the friend who had saved his life the evident sincerity and affection which inspired these remonstrances would have influenced any man with an atom of good feeling in his composition though i could not conquer my own unaccountable perversity i had at least virtue enough to be heartily ashamed of it and to end the discussion pleasantly by giving way and promising to do all that was wanted of me the rest of the evening passed merrily enough in humorous anticipations of my coming life with the two young ladies in cumberland pesca inspired by our national grog which appeared to get into his head in the most marvellous manner five minutes after it had gone down his throat asserted his claims to be considered a complete englishman by making a series of speeches in rapid succession proposing my mother's health my sister's health my health and the healths in mass of mr fairlie and the two young misses pathetically returning thanks himself immediately afterwards for the whole party a secret walter said my little friend confidentially as we walked home together i am flushed by the recollection of my own eloquence my soul bursts itself with ambition one of these days i go into your noble parliament it is the dream of my whole life to be honourable pesca m.p the next morning i sent my testimonials to the professor's employer in portland place three days passed and i concluded with secret satisfaction that my papers had not been found sufficiently explicit on the fourth day however an answer came it announced that mr fairlie accepted my services and requested me to start for cumberland immediately all the necessary instructions for my journey were carefully and clearly added in a postscript i made my arrangements unwillingly enough for leaving london early the next day towards evening pesca looked in on his way to a dinner party to bid me good bye i shall dry my tears in your absence said the professor gaily with this glorious thought it is my auspicious hand that has given the first push to your fortune in the world go my friend when your sun shines in cumberland english proverb in the name of heaven make your hay marry one of the two young misses become honourable hartright m.p and when you are on the top of the ladder remember that pesca at the bottom has done it all i tried to laugh with my little friend over his parting jest but my spirits were not to be commanded something jarred in me almost painfully while he was speaking his light farewell words when i was left alone again nothing remained to be done but to walk to the hampstead cottage and bid my mother and sarah good bye iv the heat had been painfully oppressive all day and it was now a close and sultry night my mother and sister had spoken so many last words and had begged me to wait another five minutes so many times that it was nearly midnight when the servant locked the garden gate behind me i walked forward a few paces on the shortest way back to london then stopped and hesitated the moon was full and broad in the dark blue starless sky and the broken ground of the heath looked wild enough in the mysterious light to be hundreds of miles away from the great city that lay beneath it the idea of descending any sooner than i could help into the heat and gloom of london repelled me the prospect of going to bed in my airless chambers and the prospect of gradual suffocation seemed in my present restless frame of mind and body to be one and the same thing i determined to stroll home in the purer air by the most roundabout way i could take to follow the white winding paths across the lonely heath and to approach london through its most open suburb by striking into the finchley road and so getting back in the cool of the new morning by the western side of the regent's park i wound my way down slowly over the heath enjoying the divine stillness of the scene and admiring the soft alternations of light and shade as they followed each other over the broken ground on every side of me so long as i was proceeding through this first and prettiest part of my night walk my mind remained passively open to the impressions produced by the view and i thought but little on any subject indeed so far as my own sensations were concerned i can hardly say that i thought at all but when i had left the heath and had turned into the by road where there was less to see the ideas naturally engendered by the approaching change in my habits and occupations gradually drew more and more of my attention exclusively to themselves by the time i had arrived at the end of the road i had become completely absorbed in my own fanciful visions of limmeridge house of mr fairlie and of the two ladies whose practice in the art of water colour painting i was so soon to superintend i had now arrived at that particular point of my walk where four roads met the road to hampstead along which i had returned the road to finchley the road to west end and the road back to london i had mechanically turned in this latter direction and was strolling along the lonely high road idly wondering i remember what the cumberland young ladies would look like when in one moment every drop of blood in my body was brought to a stop by the touch of a hand laid lightly and suddenly on my shoulder from behind me i turned on the instant with my fingers tightening round the handle of my stick there in the middle of the broad bright high road there as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven stood the figure of a solitary woman dressed from head to foot in white garments her face bent in grave inquiry on mine her hand pointing to the dark cloud over london as i faced her i was far too seriously startled by the suddenness with which this extraordinary apparition stood before me in the dead of night and in that lonely place to ask what she wanted the strange woman spoke first is that the road to london she said i looked attentively at her as she put that singular question to me it was then nearly one o'clock all i could discern distinctly by the moonlight was a colourless youthful face meagre and sharp to look at about the cheeks and chin large grave wistfully attentive eyes nervous uncertain lips and light hair of a pale brownish yellow hue there was nothing wild nothing immodest in her manner it was quiet and self controlled a little melancholy and a little touched by suspicion not exactly the manner of a lady and at the same time not the manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life the voice little as i had yet heard of it had something curiously still and mechanical in its tones and the utterance was remarkably rapid she held a small bag in her hand and her dress bonnet shawl and gown all of white was so far as i could guess certainly not composed of very delicate or very expensive materials her figure was slight and rather above the average height her gait and actions free from the slightest approach to extravagance this was all that i could observe of her in the dim light and under the perplexingly strange circumstances of our meeting what sort of a woman she was and how she came to be out alone in the high road an hour after midnight i altogether failed to guess the one thing of which i felt certain was that the grossest of mankind could not have misconstrued her motive in speaking even at that suspiciously late hour and in that suspiciously lonely place did you hear me she said still quietly and rapidly and without the least fretfulness or impatience i asked if that was the way to london yes i replied that is the way it leads to st john's wood and the regent's park you must excuse my not answering you before i was rather startled by your sudden appearance in the road and i am even now quite unable to account for it you don't suspect me of doing anything wrong do you i have done nothing wrong i have met with an accident i am very unfortunate in being here alone so late why do you suspect me of doing wrong she spoke with unnecessary earnestness and agitation and shrank back from me several paces i did my best to reassure her pray don't suppose that i have any idea of suspecting you i said or any other wish than to be of assistance to you if i can i only wondered at your appearance in the road because it seemed to me to be empty the instant before i saw you she turned and pointed back to a place at the junction of the road to london and the road to hampstead where there was a gap in the hedge i heard you coming she said and hid there to see what sort of man you were before i risked speaking i doubted and feared about it till you passed and then i was obliged to steal after you and touch you steal after me and touch me why not call to me strange to say the least of it may i trust you she asked you don't think the worse of me because i have met with an accident she stopped in confusion shifted her bag from one hand to the other and sighed bitterly the loneliness and helplessness of the woman touched me the natural impulse to assist her and to spare her got the better of the judgment the caution the worldly tact which an older wiser and colder man might have summoned to help him in this strange emergency you may trust me for any harmless purpose i said if it troubles you to explain your strange situation to me don't think of returning to the subject again i have no right to ask you for any explanations tell me how i can help you and if i can i will you are very kind and i am very very thankful to have met you the first touch of womanly tenderness that i had heard from her trembled in her voice as she said the words but no tears glistened in those large wistfully attentive eyes of hers which were still fixed on me i have only been in london once before she went on more and more rapidly and i know nothing about that side of it yonder can i get a fly or a carriage of any kind is it too late i don't know if you could show me where to get a fly and if you will only promise not to interfere with me and to let me leave you when and how i please i have a friend in london who will be glad to receive me i want nothing else will you promise she looked anxiously up and down the road shifted her bag again from one hand to the other repeated the words will you promise and looked hard in my face with a pleading fear and confusion that it troubled me to see what could i do here was a stranger utterly and helplessly at my mercy and that stranger a forlorn woman no house was near no one was passing whom i could consult and no earthly right existed on my part to give me a power of control over her even if i had known how to exercise it i trace these lines self distrustfully with the shadows of after events darkening the very paper i write on and still i say what could i do what i did do was to try and gain time by questioning her are you sure that your friend in london will receive you at such a late hour as this i said quite sure only say you will let me leave you when and how i please only say you won't interfere with me will you promise as she repeated the words for the third time she came close to me and laid her hand with a sudden gentle stealthiness on my bosom a thin hand a cold hand when i removed it with mine even on that sultry night remember that i was young remember that the hand which touched me was a woman's will you promise yes one word the little familiar word that is on everybody's lips every hour in the day oh me and i tremble now when i write it we set our faces towards london and walked on together in the first still hour of the new day i and this woman whose name whose character whose story whose objects in life whose very presence by my side at that moment were fathomless mysteries to me it was like a dream was i walter hartright was this the well known uneventful road where holiday people strolled on sundays had i really left little more than an hour since the quiet decent conventionally domestic atmosphere of my mother's cottage i was too bewildered too conscious also of a vague sense of something like self reproach to speak to my strange companion for some minutes it was her voice again that first broke the silence between us i want to ask you something she said suddenly do you know many people in london yes a great many many men of rank and title there was an unmistakable tone of suspicion in the strange question i hesitated about answering it some i said after a moment's silence many she came to a full stop and looked me searchingly in the face many men of the rank of baronet too much astonished to reply i questioned her in my turn why do you ask because i hope for my own sake there is one baronet that you don't know will you tell me his name i can't i daren't i forget myself when i mention it she spoke loudly and almost fiercely raised her clenched hand in the air and shook it passionately then on a sudden controlled herself again and added in tones lowered to a whisper tell me which of them you know i could hardly refuse to humour her in such a trifle and i mentioned three names two the names of fathers of families whose daughters i taught one the name of a bachelor who had once taken me a cruise in his yacht to make sketches for him ah you don't know him she said with a sigh of relief are you a man of rank and title yourself far from it i am only a drawing master as the reply passed my lips a little bitterly perhaps she took my arm with the abruptness which characterised all her actions not a man of rank and title she repeated to herself thank god i may trust him i had hitherto contrived to master my curiosity out of consideration for my companion but it got the better of me now i am afraid you have serious reason to complain of some man of rank and title i said i am afraid the baronet whose name you are unwilling to mention to me has done you some grievous wrong is he the cause of your being out here at this strange time of night don't ask me don't make me talk of it she answered i'm not fit now i have been cruelly used and cruelly wronged you will be kinder than ever if you will walk on fast and not speak to me i sadly want to quiet myself if i can we moved forward again at a quick pace and for half an hour at least not a word passed on either side from time to time being forbidden to make any more inquiries i stole a look at her face it was always the same the lips close shut the brow frowning the eyes looking straight forward eagerly and yet absently we had reached the first houses and were close on the new wesleyan college before her set features relaxed and she spoke once more do you live in london she said yes as i answered it struck me that she might have formed some intention of appealing to me for assistance or advice and that i ought to spare her a possible disappointment by warning her of my approaching absence from home so i added but to morrow i shall be away from london for some time i am going into the country where she asked north or south north to cumberland cumberland she repeated the word tenderly ah wish i was going there too i was once happy in cumberland i tried again to lift the veil that hung between this woman and me perhaps you were born i said in the beautiful lake country no she answered i was born in hampshire but i once went to school for a little while in cumberland lakes i don't remember any lakes it's limmeridge village and limmeridge house i should like to see again it was my turn now to stop suddenly in the excited state of my curiosity at that moment the chance reference to mr fairlie's place of residence on the lips of my strange companion staggered me with astonishment did you hear anybody calling after us she asked looking up and down the road affrightedly the instant i stopped no no i was only struck by the name of limmeridge house i heard it mentioned by some cumberland people a few days since ah not my people mrs fairlie is dead and her husband is dead and their little girl may be married and gone away by this time i can't say who lives at limmeridge now if any more are left there of that name i only know i love them for mrs fairlie's sake she seemed about to say more but while she was speaking we came within view of the turnpike at the top of the avenue road her hand tightened round my arm and she looked anxiously at the gate before us is the turnpike man looking out she asked he was not looking out no one else was near the place when we passed through the gate the sight of the gas lamps and houses seemed to agitate her and to make her impatient this is london she said do you see any carriage i can get i am tired and frightened i want to shut myself in and be driven away i explained to her that we must walk a little further to get to a cab stand unless we were fortunate enough to meet with an empty vehicle and then tried to resume the subject of cumberland it was useless that idea of shutting herself in and being driven away had now got full possession of her mind she could think and talk of nothing else we had hardly proceeded a third of the way down the avenue road when i saw a cab draw up at a house a few doors below us on the opposite side of the way a gentleman got out and let himself in at the garden door i hailed the cab as the driver mounted the box again when we crossed the road my companion's impatience increased to such an extent that she almost forced me to run it's so late she said i am only in a hurry because it's so late i can't take you sir if you're not going towards tottenham court road said the driver civilly when i opened the cab door my horse is dead beat and i can't get him no further than the stable yes yes that will do for me i'm going that way i'm going that way she spoke with breathless eagerness and pressed by me into the cab i had assured myself that the man was sober as well as civil before i let her enter the vehicle and now when she was seated inside i entreated her to let me see her set down safely at her destination no no no she said vehemently i'm quite safe and quite happy now if you are a gentleman remember your promise let him drive on till i stop him thank you oh thank you thank you my hand was on the cab door she caught it in hers kissed it and pushed it away the cab drove off at the same moment i started into the road with some vague idea of stopping it again i hardly knew why hesitated from dread of frightening and distressing her called at last but not loudly enough to attract the driver's attention the sound of the wheels grew fainter in the distance the cab melted into the black shadows on the road the woman in white was gone ten minutes or more had passed i was still on the same side of the way now mechanically walking forward a few paces now stopping again absently at one moment i found myself doubting the reality of my own adventure at another i was perplexed and distressed by an uneasy sense of having done wrong which yet left me confusedly ignorant of how i could have done right i hardly knew where i was going or what i meant to do next i was conscious of nothing but the confusion of my own thoughts when i was abruptly recalled to myself awakened i might almost say by the sound of rapidly approaching wheels close behind me i was on the dark side of the road in the thick shadow of some garden trees when i stopped to look round on the opposite and lighter side of the way a short distance below me a policeman was strolling along in the direction of the regent's park the carriage passed me an open chaise driven by two men stop cried one there's a policeman let's ask him the horse was instantly pulled up a few yards beyond the dark place where i stood policeman cried the first speaker have you seen a woman pass this way what sort of woman sir a woman in a lavender coloured gown no no interposed the second man the clothes we gave her were found on her bed she must have gone away in the clothes she wore when she came to us in white policeman a woman in white i haven't seen her sir if you or any of your men meet with the woman stop her and send her in careful keeping to that address i'll pay all expenses and a fair reward into the bargain the policeman looked at the card that was handed down to him why are we to stop her sir what has she done done she has escaped from my asylum don't forget a woman in white drive on v she has escaped from my asylum i cannot say with truth that the terrible inference which those words suggested flashed upon me like a new revelation some of the strange questions put to me by the woman in white after my ill considered promise to leave her free to act as she pleased had suggested the conclusion either that she was naturally flighty and unsettled or that some recent shock of terror had disturbed the balance of her faculties but the idea of absolute insanity which we all associate with the very name of an asylum had i can honestly declare never occurred to me in connection with her i had seen nothing in her language or her actions to justify it at the time and even with the new light thrown on her by the words which the stranger had addressed to the policeman i could see nothing to justify it now what had i done assisted the victim of the most horrible of all false imprisonments to escape or cast loose on the wide world of london an unfortunate creature whose actions it was my duty and every man's duty mercifully to control i turned sick at heart when the question occurred to me and when i felt self reproachfully that it was asked too late in the disturbed state of my mind it was useless to think of going to bed when i at last got back to my chambers in clement's inn before many hours elapsed it would be necessary to start on my journey to cumberland i sat down and tried first to sketch then to read but the woman in white got between me and my pencil between me and my book had the forlorn creature come to any harm that was my first thought though i shrank selfishly from confronting it other thoughts followed on which it was less harrowing to dwell where had she stopped the cab what had become of her now had she been traced and captured by the men in the chaise or was she still capable of controlling her own actions and were we two following our widely parted roads towards one point in the mysterious future at which we were to meet once more it was a relief when the hour came to lock my door to bid farewell to london pursuits london pupils and london friends and to be in movement again towards new interests and a new life even the bustle and confusion at the railway terminus so wearisome and bewildering at other times roused me and did me good my travelling instructions directed me to go to carlisle and then to diverge by a branch railway which ran in the direction of the coast as a misfortune to begin with our engine broke down between lancaster and carlisle the delay occasioned by this accident caused me to be too late for the branch train by which i was to have gone on immediately i had to wait some hours and when a later train finally deposited me at the nearest station to limmeridge house it was past ten and the night was so dark that i could hardly see my way to the pony chaise which mr fairlie had ordered to be in waiting for me the driver was evidently discomposed by the lateness of my arrival he was in that state of highly respectful sulkiness which is peculiar to english servants we drove away slowly through the darkness in perfect silence the roads were bad and the dense obscurity of the night increased the difficulty of getting over the ground quickly it was by my watch nearly an hour and a half from the time of our leaving the station before i heard the sound of the sea in the distance and the crunch of our wheels on a smooth gravel drive we had passed one gate before entering the drive and we passed another before we drew up at the house i was received by a solemn man servant out of livery was informed that the family had retired for the night and was then led into a large and lofty room where my supper was awaiting me in a forlorn manner at one extremity of a lonesome mahogany wilderness of dining table i was too tired and out of spirits to eat or drink much especially with the solemn servant waiting on me as elaborately as if a small dinner party had arrived at the house instead of a solitary man in a quarter of an hour i was ready to be taken up to my bedchamber the solemn servant conducted me into a prettily furnished room said breakfast at nine o'clock sir looked all round him to see that everything was in its proper place and noiselessly withdrew what shall i see in my dreams to night i thought to myself as i put out the candle the woman in white or the unknown inhabitants of this cumberland mansion it was a strange sensation to be sleeping in the house like a friend of the family and yet not to know one of the inmates even by sight vi when i rose the next morning and drew up my blind the sea opened before me joyously under the broad august sunlight and the distant coast of scotland fringed the horizon with its lines of melting blue the view was such a surprise and such a change to me after my weary london experience of brick and mortar landscape that i seemed to burst into a new life and a new set of thoughts the moment i looked at it a confused sensation of having suddenly lost my familiarity with the past without acquiring any additional clearness of idea in reference to the present or the future took possession of my"
