"1" "don't perplex yourself she whispered anxiously noting my bewilderment there's plenty of time and it makes no difference not a particle really i put my hand to my head i can't think i can't think there's one girl has nervous prostration and her name's got mixed with mine and i can't hush hush never mind you shall come and lie down in my room you'll stay with us to night anyway and we'll have a doctor in bishop that's right assented the bishop i'll go get him myself you you're not going i cried in dismay it was real i hated to see him go nonsense phone it was edward who went himself to telephone for the doctor and i saw my time getting short but the bishop had to go anyway he looked out at his horses shivering in front of the house and the sight hurried him my child he said taking my hand just let mrs ramsay take care of you to night don't bother about anything but just rest i'll see you in the morning he went on noticing that i kind of clung to him well i did can't you remember what i said to you in the carriage that i wished you were my daughter i wish you were indeed i do and that i could take you home with me and keep you child then to night if when you pray will you pray for me as if i was your own daughter tom dorgan you think no prayers but a priest's are any good you bigoted snickering catholic i tell you if some day i cut loose from you and start in over again it'll be the bishop's prayers that'll do it the dowager and i passed edward in the ball he gave me a look behind her back and i gave him one to match it just practice you know tom a girl can never know when she'll want to be expert in these things she made me lie down on a couch while she turned the lamp low and then left me alone in a big palace of a bedroom filled with things and i wanted everything i saw if i could i'd have lifted everything in sight but every minute brought that doctor nearer soon as i could be really sure she was gone i got up and hurrying to the long french windows that opened on the great stone piazza i unfastened them quietly and inch by inch i pushed them open there within ten feet of me stood edward no escape that way he saw me and was tiptoeing heavily toward me when i heard the door click behind me and in walked the dowager back again i flew to her i thought i heard some one out there i said it frightened me so that i got up to look nobody could be out there could they she walked to the window and put her head out her lips tightened grimly no nobody could be out there she said breathing hard but you might get nervous just thinking there might be we'll go to a room upstairs and go we did in spite of all i could plead about feeling well enough now to go alone and all the rest of it how was i to get out of a second or third story window i began to think about the correction again as i followed her upstairs and after she'd left me i just sat waiting for the doctor to come and send me there i didn't much care till i remembered the bishop i could almost see his face as it would look when he'd be called to testify against me and i'd be standing in that railed in prisoner's pen in the middle of the court room where dan christensen stood when they tried him no i couldn't bear that not without a fight anyway it was for the bishop i'd got into this part of the scrape i'd get out of it so's he shouldn't know how bad a thing a girl can be while i lay thinking it over the same maid that had brought me the tea came in she was an ugly thin little thing if she's a sample of the maids in that house the lot of them would take the kink out of your pretty hair thomas j dorgan esquire late of the house of refuge and soon of moyamensing don't throw things people in my set mine and the dowager's don't she had been sent to help me undress she said and make me comfortable the doctor lived just around the corner and would be in in a minute phew she wasn't very promising but she was my only chance i took her i really don't need any help thank you nora i said chipper as a sparrow and remembering the name the dowager had called her by aunt henrietta is too fussy don't you think oh of course you won't say a word against her she told me the other day that she'd never had a maid so sensible and quick witted too as her nora do you know i've a mind to play a joke on the doctor when he comes you'll help me won't you oh i know you will suddenly i remembered the bishop's bill i took it out of my pocket yep tom that's where it went i had to choose between giving that skinny maid the biggest tip she ever got in her life or nance olden to the correction you needn't swear tom dorgan i fancy if i'd got there you'd got worse no you bully you know i wouldn't tell but the police sort of know how to pair our kind in her cap and apron i let the doctor in and myself out and i don't regret a thing up there in the square except that lovely red coat with the high collar and the hat with the fur on it i'd give tom get me a coat like that and i'll marry you for life no there's one thing i could do better if it was to be done over again i could make that dear little old bishop wish harder i'd been his daughter what am i mooning about oh nothing there's the watch edward's watch take it ii yes empty handed tom dorgan and i can't honestly say i didn't have the chance but if my hands are empty my head is full listen there's a girl i know with short brown hair a turned up nose and gray eyes rather far apart you know her too well she can't help that but this girl oh she makes such a pretty boy and the ladies at the hotel over in brooklyn they just dote on her when she's not only a boy but a bell boy her name may be nancy when she's in petticoats but in trousers she's nathaniel in short nat now nat in blue and buttons with his nails kept better than most boys with his curly hair parted in the middle and with a gentle tang to his voice that makes him almost girlish who would suspect nat of having a stolen pass key in his pocket and a pretty fair knowledge of the contents of almost every top bureau drawer in the hotel not mrs sarah kingdon a widow just arrived from philadelphia and desperately gone on young mr george moriway also fresh from philadelphia and desperately gone on mrs kingdon's money the tips that lady gave the bad boy nat i knew i couldn't make you believe it any other way that's why i passed em on to you tommy boy the hotel woman you know girls is a hotel woman because she isn't fit to be anything else she's lazy and selfish and little and she's shifted all her legitimate cares on to the proprietor's shoulders she actually you can understand and share my indignation can't you tom as you've shared other things she even gives over her black tin box full of valuables to the hotel clerk to put in the safe the coward but her vanity ah there's where we get her such speculators as you and myself she's got to outshine the woman who sits at the next table and so she borrows her diamonds from the clerk wears em like the peacock she is and trembles till they're back in the safe again in the meantime she locks them up in the tin box which she puts in her top bureau drawer hides the key forgets where she hid it and o tom after searching for it for hours and making herself sick with anxiety she ties up her head in a wet handkerchief with vinegar on it and rings the bell for the bell boy he comes as i said he's a prompt gentle little bell boy slight looks rather young for his job but that very youth and innocence of his make him such a fellow to trust nat says mrs kingdon tearfully pressing half a dollar into the nice lad's hand i i've lost something and i want you to to help me find it yes'm says nat he's the soul of politeness it must be here it must be in this room says the lady getting wild with the terror of losing i'm sure positive that i went straight to the shoe bag and slipped it in there and now i can't find it and i must have it before i go out this afternoon for for a very special reason my daughter evelyn will be home to morrow and why don't you look for it what is it ma'am i told you once my key a little flat key that locks a box i've got she finishes distrustfully have you looked in the shoe bag ma'am why of course i have you little stupid i want you to hunt other places where i can't easily get there are other places i might have put it but i'm positive it was in the shoe bag well i looked for that key where where not i looked under the rubbish in the waste paper basket mrs kingdon often fooled thieves by dropping it there i pulled up the corner of the carpet and looked there it was loose it had often been used for a hiding place i looked in miss evelyn's boot and in her ribbon box i emptied mrs kingdon's full powder box i climbed ladders and felt along cornices i looked through the pockets of mrs kingdon's gowns a clever bell boy it takes to find a woman's pocket but even the real masculine ones among em are half feminine they've had so much to do with women i rummaged through her writing desk and in searching a gold cornered pad found a note from moriway hidden under the corner i hid it again carefully in my coat pocket a love letter from moriway to a woman twenty years older than himself tain't a bad lay tom dorgan but you needn't try it at first she watched every move i made but later as her headache grew worse she got desperate so then i put my hand down into the shoe bag and found the key where it had slipped under a fold of cloth do you suppose that woman was grateful she snatched it from me i knew it was there i told you it was there if you'd had any sense you'd have looked there first the boys in this hotel are so stupid that's all ma'am she nodded she was fitting the key into the black box she'd taken from the top drawer nat had got to the outside door when he heard her come shrieking after him nat nat come back my diamonds they're not here i know i put them back last night i'm positive i could swear to it i can see myself putting them in the chamois bag and o my god where can they be this time they're gone nat could have told her but what's the use he felt she'd only lose em again if she had em so he let them lie snug in his trousers pocket where he had put the chamois bag when his eyes lit on it under the corner of the carpet he might have passed it over to her then but you see tom she hadn't told him to look for a bag it was a key she wanted bell boys are so stupid this time she followed his every step he could not put his hand on the smallest thing without rousing her suspicion if he hesitated she scolded if he hurried she fumed most unjust i call it because he had no thought of stealing just then come she said at last we'll go down and report it at the desk hadn't i better wait here ma'am and look again she looked sharply at him no you'd better do just as i tell you so down we went and we met mr moriway there she'd telephoned him the chambermaid was called the housekeeper the electrical engineer who'd been fixing bells that morning and as i said a bell boy named nat who told how he'd just come on duty when mrs kingdon's bell rang found her key and returned it to her and was out of the room when she unlocked the box that was all he knew is he telling the truth moriway asked mrs kingdon ye es i guess he is but where are the diamonds we must have them you know to day george she whispered and then she turned and went upstairs leaving moriway to do the rest there's only one thing to do major he said to the proprietor search em all and then search me it's an outrage cried the housekeeper search me if ye loike growled mccarthy resentfully oi wasn't there but a minute the lady herself can tell ye that katie the chambermaid flushed painfully and there were indignant tears in her eyes which i'll tell you in confidence made a girl named nancy uncomfortable but the boy nat knowing that bell boys have no rights said nothing but he thought he thought tom dorgan a lot of things and a long way ahead the peppery old major marched us all off to his private office not much girls it hadn't come for suddenly the annunciator rang out out of the corner of his eye nat looked at the bell boy's bench it was empty there was to be a ball that night and the bells were going it over all the place number twenty one shouted the clerk at the desk but number twenty one didn't budge his heart was beating like a hammer and the ting ng ng of that bell calling him rang in his head like a song number twenty one yelled the clerk oh he's got a devil of a temper has that clerk some day tom when you love me very much go up to the hotel and break his face for me you boy confound you can't you hear he shouted that time he caught the major's ear the one that wasn't deaf he looked from powers black face to the bench and then to me and all the time the bell kept ringing like mad git he said to the boy and come back in a hurry number twenty one got but leisurely it wouldn't do for a bell boy to hurry particularly when he had such good cause oh girls those stone stairs the servants stairs at the st james they're fierce i tell you mag scrubbing the floors at the cruelty ain't so bad but this time i was jolly glad bell boys weren't allowed in the elevator for there were those diamonds in my pants pocket and i must get rid of em before i got down to the office again so i climbed those stairs and every step i took my eye was searching for a hiding place i could have pitched the little bag out of a window but nancy olden wasn't throwing diamonds to the birds any more than mag here is likely to cut off the braids of red hair we used to play horse with when we drove her about the cruelty yard one flight no chance another everything bare as stone and soap could keep it the third flight my knees began to tremble and not with climbing the call came from this floor but i ran up a fourth just on the chance and there in a corner was a fire hatchet strapped to the wall behind that hatchet mrs kingdon's diamonds might lie snug till evening i put the ends of my fingers first in the little crack to make sure the little bag wouldn't drop to the floor and then dived into my pocket and and there behind me stealthily coming up the last turn of the stairs was mr george moriway don't you hate a soft walking man mag that cute fellow was cuter than the old major himself and had followed me every inch of the way there's something loose with this hatchet sir i said innocently looking down at him oh there is what an observing little fellow you are never mind the hatchet just tell me what number you were sent to answer number i repeated as though i couldn't see why he wanted to know why 431 not much my boy 331 scuse me sir ain't you mistaken he looked at me for full a minute i stared him straight in the eye a nasty eye he's got black and bloodshot and cold and full of suspicion but it wavered a bit at the end i may be he said slowly but not about the number just you turn around and get down to 331 all right sir thank you very much it might have got me in trouble the ladies are so particular about having the bells answered quick i guess you'll get in trouble all right he said and stood watching from where he stood he could watch me every inch of the way till i got to 331 at the end of the hall mrs kingdon's door and the goods still on me tom mind that my but mrs kingdon was wrathy when she saw me why did they send you she cried why did you keep me waiting so long i want a chambermaid i've rung a dozen times the whole place is crazy about that old ball to night and no one can get decent attention can't i do what you want ma'am i just yearned to get inside that door no she snapped i don't want a boy to fasten my dress in the back we often do ma'am i said softly you do well yes'm i breathed again well it's indecent go down and send me a maid she was just closing the door in my face and moriway waiting for me to watch me down again mrs kingdon well what do you want i want to tell you that when i get down to the office they'll search me she looked at me amazed and and there's something in my pocket i you wouldn't like them to find what in the world my diamonds you did take them you little wretch she caught hold of my coat but lordy i didn't want to get away a little bit i let her pull me in and then i backed up against the door and shut it diamonds oh no ma'am i hope i'm not a thief but but it was something you dropped this i fished moriway's letter out of my pocket and handed it to her the poor old lady being a bell boy you know just how old ladies really are this one at evening after her face had been massaged for an hour and the manicure girl and the hair dresser had gone wasn't so bad but to day with the marks of the morning's tears on her agitated face with the blood pounding up to her temples where the hair was thin and gray tom dorgan if i'm a vain old fool like that when i'm three times as old as i am just tie a stone around my neck and take me down and drop me into the nearest water won't you you abominable little wretch she sobbed i suppose you've told everybody in the office how could i ma'am how could you she looked up the tears on her flabby flushed cheek i didn't know myself i can't read writing it was thin but she wanted to believe it she could have taken me in her arms she was so happy there there she patted my shoulder and gave me a dollar bill i was a bit hasty nat it's only a a little business matter that mr moriway's attending to for me we we'll finish it up this afternoon i shouldn't like miss kingdon to know of it because because i never like to worry her about business you know so don't mention it when she comes to morrow no'm shall i fasten your dress i simply had to stay in that room till i could get rid of those diamonds with a faded old blush the nicest thing about her i'd ever seen she turned her back it's dark to day ma'am i coaxed would you mind coming nearer the window no she wouldn't mind she backed up to the corner like a gentle little lamb while i hooked with one hand i dropped the little bag where the carpet was still turned up and with the toe of my shoe spread it flat again you're real handy for a boy she said pleased thank you ma'am i answered pleased myself moriway was still watching me of course when i came out but i ran downstairs he following close and when the major got hold of me i pulled my pockets inside out like a little man moriway was there at the time i knew he wasn't convinced but he couldn't watch a bell boy all day long and the moment i was sure his eyes were off me i was ready to get those diamonds back again but not a call came all that afternoon from the west side of the house except the call of those pretty precious things snug under the carpet calling calling to me to come and get them and drop bell boying for good at last i couldn't stand it any longer there's only one thing to do when your chance won't come to you that is to go to it at about four o'clock i lit out climbed to the second story and there mag i always was the luckiest girl at the cruelty wasn't i well there was suite 231 all torn up plumbers and painters in there and nothing in the world to prevent a boy's skinning through when no one was watching out of the window and up the fire escape just outside of mrs kingdon's window i lay still a minute i had seen her and moriway go out together she all gay with finery he carrying her bag the lace curtains in 331 were blowing in the breeze cautiously i parted them and looked in everything was lovely from where i lay i reached down and turned back the flap of the carpet it was too easy those darling diamonds seemed just to leap up into my hand in a moment i had them tucked away in my pants pocket then down the fire escape and out through 231 where i told the painter i'd been to get a toy the boy in 441 had dropped out of the window but he paid no attention to me no one did though i felt those diamonds shining like an x ray through my very body i got downstairs and was actually outside the door almost in the street and off to you when a girl called me here boy carry this case she said do you know who it was oh yes you do a dear old friend of mine from philadelphia a young lady whose taste well all right i'll tell you it was the girl with the red coat and the hat with the chinchilla fur how did they look oh fairly well on a blonde but to my taste the last girl i'd seen in the coat and hat was handsomer well i carried her suit case and followed her back into the hotel i didn't want to a bit though that coat still wonder how she got it back she sailed up the hall and into the elevator and i had to follow we got of at the third story and she brought me right to the door of 331 and then i knew this must be evelyn mrs kingdon's out miss she didn't expect you till to morrow did she tell you that too bad she isn't at home she said she'd be kept busy all day to day with a business matter and that i'd better not get here till to morrow but i wanted to get here in time for the wedding i suggested softly you should have seen her jump wedding not mrs kingdon and mr moriway she turned white has that man followed her here quick tell me has she actually married him no not yet it's for five o'clock at the church on the corner how do you know she turned on me suddenly suspicious well i do know and i'm the only person in the house that does i don't believe you she took out her key and opened the door and i followed her in with the suit case but before i could get it set down on the floor she had swooped on a letter that was lying in the middle of the table had torn it open and then with a cry had come whirling toward me where is this church come help me to get to it before five and i'll oh you shall have anything in the world you want she flew out into the hall i after her and first thing you know we were down in the street around the corner and there in front of the church was a carriage with moriway just helping mrs kingdon out mother at that cry the old lady's knees seemed to crumble under her her poor old painted face looked out ghastly and ashamed from her wedding finery but evelyn in her red coat flew to her and took her in her arms as though she was a child and like a child mrs kingdon sobbed and made excuses and begged to be forgiven i looked at moriway it was all the pay i wanted particularly as i had those little diamonds you're just in time miss kingdon he said uneasily to make your mother happy by your presence at her wedding i'm just in time mr moriway to see that my mother's not made unhappy by your presence evelyn mrs kingdon remonstrated come sarah moriway offered his arm the bride shook her head to morrow she said feebly moriway breathed a swear miss kingdon laughed i've come to take care of you you silly little mother dear it won't be to morrow mr moriway no not to morrow next week sighed mrs kingdon in fact mother's changed her mind mr moriway she thinks it ungenerous to accept such a sacrifice from a man who might be her son don't you mother well perhaps george she looked up from her daughter's shoulder she was crying all over that precious red coat of mine and her eyes lit on me oh you wicked boy you told a lie she gasped you did read my letter i laughed laughed out loud it was such a bully thing to watch moriway's face but that was an unlucky laugh of mine it turned his wrath on me he made a dive toward me i ducked and ran oh how i ran but if he hadn't slipped on the curb he'd have had me as he fell though he let out a yell stop thief stop thief thief thief thief may you never hear it mag behind you when you've somebody else's diamonds in your pocket it sounds it sounds the way the bay of the hounds must sound to the hare it seems to fly along with the air at the same time to be behind you at your side even in front of you i heard it bellowed in a dozen different voices and every now and then i could hear moriway as i pelted on that brassy cruel bellow of his that made my heart sick and then all at once i heard a policeman's whistle that whistle was like a signal i saw the gates of the correction open before me i saw your nance tom in a neat striped dress and she was behind bars bars bars there were bars everywhere before me in fact i felt them against my very hands for in my mad race i had shot up a blind alley a street that ended in a garden behind an iron fence i grabbed the diamonds to throw them from me but i couldn't i just couldn't i jumped the fence where the gate was low and with that whistle flying shrill and shriller after me i ran to the house i might have"
