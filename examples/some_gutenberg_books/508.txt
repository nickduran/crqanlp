"1" "ear there is a foolish fancy that i cannot get rid of i am expecting my bridegroom to come into the church with my first two husbands for groomsmen look look screamed the bridemaid what is here the funeral as she spoke a dark procession paced into the church first came an old man and women like chief mourners at a funeral attired from head to foot in the deepest black all but their pale features and hoary hair he leaning on a staff and supporting her decrepit form with his nerveless arm behind appeared another and another pair as aged as black and mournful as the first as they drew near the widow recognized in every face some trait of former friends long forgotten but now returning as if from their old graves to warn her to prepare a shroud or with purpose almost as unwelcome to exhibit their wrinkles and infirmity and claim her as their companion by the tokens of her own decay many a merry night had she danced with them in youth and now in joyless age she felt that some withered partner should request her hand and all unite in a dance of death to the music of the funeral bell while these aged mourners were passing up the aisle it was observed that from pew to pew the spectators shuddered with irrepressible awe as some object hitherto concealed by the intervening figures came full in sight many turned away their faces others kept a fixed and rigid stare and a young girl giggled hysterically and fainted with the laughter on her lips when the spectral procession approached the altar each couple separated and slowly diverged till in the centre appeared a form that had been worthily ushered in with all this gloomy pomp the death knell and the funeral it was the bridegroom in his shroud no garb but that of the grave could have befitted such a deathlike aspect the eyes indeed had the wild gleam of a sepulchral lamp all else was fixed in the stern calmness which old men wear in the coffin the corpse stood motionless but addressed the widow in accents that seemed to melt into the clang of the bell which fell heavily on the air while he spoke come my bride said those pale lips the hearse is ready the sexton stands waiting for us at the door of the tomb let us be married and then to our coffins how shall the widow's horror be represented it gave her the ghastliness of a dead man's bride her youthful friends stood apart shuddering at the mourners the shrouded bridegroom and herself the whole scene expressed by the strongest imagery the vain struggle of the gilded vanities of this world when opposed to age infirmity sorrow and death the awe struck silence was first broken by the clergyman mr ellenwood said he soothingly yet with somewhat of authority you are not well your mind has been agitated by the unusual circumstances in which you are placed the ceremony must be deferred as an old friend let me entreat you to return home home yes but not without my bride answered he in the same hollow accents you deem this mockery perhaps madness had i bedizened my aged and broken frame with scarlet and embroidery had i forced my withered lips to smile at my dead heart that might have been mockery or madness but now let young and old declare which of us has come hither without a wedding garment the bridegroom or the bride he stepped forward at a ghostly pace and stood beside the widow contrasting the awful simplicity of his shroud with the glare and glitter in which she had arrayed herself for this unhappy scene none that beheld them could deny the terrible strength of the moral which his disordered intellect had contrived to draw cruel cruel groaned the heart stricken bride cruel repeated he then losing his deathlike composure in a wild bitterness heaven judge which of us has been cruel to the other in youth you deprived me of my happiness my hopes my aims you took away all the substance of my life and made it a dream without reality enough even to grieve at with only a pervading gloom through which i walked wearily and cared not whither but after forty years when i have built my tomb and would not give up the thought of resting there nor not for such a life as we once pictured you call me to the altar at your summons i am here but other husbands have enjoyed your youth your beauty your warmth of heart and all that could be termed your life what is there for me but your decay and death and therefore i have bidden these funeral friends and bespoken the sexton's deepest knell and am come in my shroud to wed you as with a burial service that we may join our hands at the door of the sepulchre and enter it together it was not frenzy it was not merely the drunkenness of strong emotion in a heart unused to it that now wrought upon the bride the stern lesson of the day had done its work her worldliness was gone she seized the bridegroom's hand yes cried she let us wed even at the door of the sepulchre my life is gone in vanity and emptiness but at its close there is one true feeling it has made me what i was in youth it makes me worthy of you time is no more for both of us let us wed for eternity with a long and deep regard the bridegroom looked into her eyes while a tear was gathering in his own how strange that gush of human feeling from the frozen bosom of a corpse he wiped away the tears even with his shroud beloved of my youth said he i have been wild the despair of my whole lifetime had returned at once and maddened me forgive and be forgiven yes it is evening with us now and we have realized none of our morning dreams of happiness but let us join our hands before the altar as lovers whom adverse circumstances have separated through life yet who meet again as they are leaving it and find their earthly affection changed into something holy as religion and what is time to the married of eternity amid the tears of many and a swell of exalted sentiment in those who felt aright was solemnized the union of two immortal souls the train of withered mourners the hoary bridegroom in his shroud the pale features of the aged bride and the death bell tolling through the whole till its deep voice overpowered the marriage words all marked the funeral of earthly hopes but as the ceremony proceeded the organ as if stirred by the sympathies of this impressive scene poured forth an anthem first mingling with the dismal knell then rising to a loftier strain till the soul looked down upon its woe and when the awful rite was finished and with cold hand in cold hand the married of eternity withdrew the organ's peal of solemn triumph drowned the wedding knell the minister's black veil a parable 1 1 another clergyman in new england mr joseph moody of york maine who died about eighty years since made himself remarkable by the same eccentricity that is here related of the reverend mr hooper in his case however the symbol had a different import in early life he had accidentally killed a beloved friend and from that day till the hour of his own death he hid his face from men the sexton stood in the porch of milford meeting house pulling busily at the bell rope the old people of the village came stooping along the street children with bright faces tripped merrily beside their parents or mimicked a graver gait in the conscious dignity of their sunday clothes spruce bachelors looked sidelong at the pretty maidens and fancied that the sabbath sunshine made them prettier than on week days when the throng had mostly streamed into the porch the sexton began to toll the bell keeping his eye on the reverend mr hooper's door the first glimpse of the clergyman's figure was the signal for the bell to cease its summons but what has good parson hooper got upon his face cried the sexton in astonishment all within hearing immediately turned about and beheld the semblance of mr hooper pacing slowly his meditative way towards the meetinghouse with one accord they started expressing more wonder than if some strange minister were coming to dust the cushions of mr hooper's pulpit are you sure it is our parson inquired goodman gray of the sexton of a certainty it is good mr hooper replied the sexton he was to have exchanged pulpits with parson shute of westbury but parson shute sent to excuse himself yesterday being to preach a funeral sermon the cause of so much amazement may appear sufficiently slight mr hooper a gentlemanly person of about thirty though still a bachelor was dressed with due clerical neatness as if a careful wife had starched his band and brushed the weekly dust from his sunday's garb there was but one thing remarkable in his appearance swathed about his forehead and hanging down over his face so low as to be shaken by his breath mr hooper had on a black veil on a nearer view it seemed to consist of two folds of crape which entirely concealed his features except the mouth and chin but probably did not intercept his sight further than to give a darkened aspect to all living and inanimate things with this gloomy shade before him good mr hooper walked onward at a slow and quiet pace stooping somewhat and looking on the ground as is customary with abstracted men yet nodding kindly to those of his parishioners who still waited on the meeting house steps but so wonder struck were they that his greeting hardly met with a return i can't really feel as if good mr hooper's face was behind that piece of crape said the sexton i don't like it muttered an old woman as she hobbled into the meeting house he has changed himself into something awful only by hiding his face our parson has gone mad cried goodman gray following him across the threshold a rumor of some unaccountable phenomenon had preceded mr hooper into the meeting house and set all the congregation astir few could refrain from twisting their heads towards the door many stood upright and turned directly about while several little boys clambered upon the seats and came down again with a terrible racket there was a general bustle a rustling of the women's gowns and shuffling of the men's feet greatly at variance with that hushed repose which should attend the entrance of the minister but mr hooper appeared not to notice the perturbation of his people he entered with an almost noiseless step bent his head mildly to the pews on each side and bowed as he passed his oldest parishioner a white haired great grandsire who occupied an arm chair in the centre of the aisle it was strange to observe how slowly this venerable man became conscious of something singular in the appearance of his pastor he seemed not fully to partake of the prevailing wonder till mr hooper had ascended the stairs and showed himself in the pulpit face to face with his congregation except for the black veil that mysterious emblem was never once withdrawn it shook with his measured breath as he gave out the psalm it threw its obscurity between him and the holy page as he read the scriptures and while he prayed the veil lay heavily on his uplifted countenance did he seek to hide it from the dread being whom he was addressing such was the effect of this simple piece of crape that more than one woman of delicate nerves was forced to leave the meeting house yet perhaps the pale faced congregation was almost as fearful a sight to the minister as his black veil to them mr hooper had the reputation of a good preacher but not an energetic one he strove to win his people heavenward by mild persuasive influences rather than to drive them thither by the thunders of the word the sermon which he now delivered was marked by the same characteristics of style and manner as the general series of his pulpit oratory but there was something either in the sentiment of the discourse itself or in the imagination of the auditors which made it greatly the most powerful effort that they had ever heard from their pastor's lips it was tinged rather more darkly than usual with the gentle gloom of mr hooper's temperament the subject had reference to secret sin and those sad mysteries which we hide from our nearest and dearest and would fain conceal from our own consciousness even forgetting that the omniscient can detect them a subtle power was breathed into his words each member of the congregation the most innocent girl and the man of hardened breast felt as if the preacher had crept upon them behind his awful veil and discovered their hoarded iniquity of deed or thought many spread their clasped hands on their bosoms there was nothing terrible in what mr hooper said at least no violence and yet with every tremor of his melancholy voice the hearers quaked an unsought pathos came hand in hand with awe so sensible were the audience of some unwonted attribute in their minister that they longed for a breath of wind to blow aside the veil almost believing that a stranger's visage would be discovered though the form gesture and voice were those of mr hooper at the close of the services the people hurried out with indecorous confusion eager to communicate their pent up amazement and conscious of lighter spirits the moment they lost sight of the black veil some gathered in little circles huddled closely together with their mouths all whispering in the centre some went homeward alone wrapt in silent meditation some talked loudly and profaned the sabbath day with ostentatious laughter a few shook their sagacious heads intimating that they could penetrate the mystery while one or two affirmed that there was no mystery at all but only that mr hooper's eyes were so weakened by the midnight lamp as to require a shade after a brief interval forth came good mr hooper also in the rear of his flock turning his veiled face from one group to another he paid due reverence to the hoary heads saluted the middle aged with kind dignity as their friend and spiritual guide greeted the young with mingled authority and love and laid his hands on the little children's heads to bless them such was always his custom on the sabbath day strange and bewildered looks repaid him for his courtesy none as on former occasions aspired to the honor of walking by their pastor's side old squire saunders doubtless by an accidental lapse of memory neglected to invite mr hooper to his table where the good clergyman had been wont to bless the food almost every sunday since his settlement he returned therefore to the parsonage and at the moment of closing the door was observed to look back upon the people all of whom had their eyes fixed upon the minister a sad smile gleamed faintly from beneath the black veil and flickered about his mouth glimmering as he disappeared how strange said a lady that a simple black veil such as any woman might wear on her bonnet should become such a terrible thing on mr hooper's face something must surely be amiss with mr hooper's intellects observed her husband the physician of the village but the strangest part of the affair is the effect of this vagary even on a sober minded man like myself the black veil though it covers only our pastor's face throws its influence over his whole person and makes him ghostlike from head to foot do you not feel it so truly do i replied the lady and i would not be alone with him for the world i wonder he is not afraid to be alone with himself men sometimes are so said her husband the afternoon service was attended with similar circumstances at its conclusion the bell tolled for the funeral of a young lady the relatives and friends were assembled in the house and the more distant acquaintances stood about the door speaking of the good qualities of the deceased when their talk was interrupted by the appearance of mr hooper still covered with his black veil it was now an appropriate emblem the clergyman stepped into the room where the corpse was laid and bent over the coffin to take a last farewell of his deceased parishioner as he stooped the veil hung straight down from his forehead so that if her eyelids had not been closed forever the dead maiden might have seen his face could mr hooper be fearful of her glance that he so hastily caught back the black veil a person who watched the interview between the dead and living scrupled not to affirm that at the instant when the clergyman's features were disclosed the corpse had slightly shuddered rustling the shroud and muslin cap though the countenance retained the composure of death a superstitious old woman was the only witness of this prodigy from the coffin mr hooper passed into the chamber of the mourners and thence to the head of the staircase to make the funeral prayer it was a tender and heart dissolving prayer full of sorrow yet so imbued with celestial hopes that the music of a heavenly harp swept by the fingers of the dead seemed faintly to be heard among the saddest accents of the minister the people trembled though they but darkly understood him when he prayed that they and himself and all of mortal race might be ready as he trusted this young maiden had been for the dreadful hour that should snatch the veil from their faces the bearers went heavily forth and the mourners followed saddening all the street with the dead before them and mr hooper in his black veil behind why do you look back said one in the procession to his partner i had a fancy replied she that the minister and the maiden's spirit were walking hand in hand and so had i at the same moment said the other that night the handsomest couple in milford village were to be joined in wedlock though reckoned a melancholy man mr hooper had a placid cheerfulness for such occasions which often excited a sympathetic smile where livelier merriment would have been thrown away there was no quality of his disposition which made him more beloved than this the company at the wedding awaited his arrival with impatience trusting that the strange awe which had gathered over him throughout the day would now be dispelled but such was not the result when mr hooper came the first thing that their eyes rested on was the same horrible black veil which had added deeper gloom to the funeral and could portend nothing but evil to the wedding such was its immediate effect on the guests that a cloud seemed to have rolled duskily from beneath the black crape and dimmed the light of the candles the bridal pair stood up before the minister but the bride's cold fingers quivered in the tremulous hand of the bridegroom and her deathlike paleness caused a whisper that the maiden who had been buried a few hours before was come from her grave to be married if ever another wedding were so dismal it was that famous one where they tolled the wedding knell after performing the ceremony mr hooper raised a glass of wine to his lips wishing happiness to the newmarried couple in a strain of mild pleasantry that ought to have brightened the features of the guests like a cheerful gleam from the hearth at that instant catching a glimpse of his figure in the looking glass the black veil involved his own spirit in the horror with which it overwhelmed all others his frame shuddered his lips grew white he spilt the untasted wine upon the carpet and rushed forth into the darkness for the earth too had on her black veil the next day the whole village of milford talked of little else than parson hooper's black veil that and the mystery concealed behind it supplied a topic for discussion between acquaintances meeting in the street and good women gossiping at their open windows it was the first item of news that the tavern keeper told to his guests the children babbled of it on their way to school one imitative little imp covered his face with an old black handkerchief thereby so affrighting his playmates that the panic seized himself and he well nigh lost his wits by his own waggery it was remarkable that all of the busybodies and impertinent people in the parish not one ventured to put the plain question to mr hooper wherefore he did this thing hitherto whenever there appeared the slightest call for such interference he had never lacked advisers nor shown himself averse to be guided by their judgment if he erred at all it was by so painful a degree of self distrust that even the mildest censure would lead him to consider an indifferent action as a crime yet though so well acquainted with this amiable weakness no individual among his parishioners chose to make the black veil a subject of friendly remonstrance there was a feeling of dread neither plainly confessed nor carefully concealed which caused each to shift the responsibility upon another till at length it was found expedient to send a deputation of the church in order to deal with mr hooper about the mystery before it should grow into a scandal never did an embassy so ill discharge its duties the minister received then with friendly courtesy but became silent after they were seated leaving to his visitors the whole burden of introducing their important business the topic it might be supposed was obvious enough there was the black veil swathed round mr hooper's forehead and concealing every feature above his placid mouth on which at times they could perceive the glimmering of a melancholy smile but that piece of crape to their imagination seemed to hang down before his heart the symbol of a fearful secret between him and them were the veil but cast aside they might speak freely of it but not till then thus they sat a considerable time speechless confused and shrinking uneasily from mr hooper's eye which they felt to be fixed upon them with an invisible glance finally the deputies returned abashed to their constituents pronouncing the matter too weighty to be handled except by a council of the churches if indeed it might not require a general synod but there was one person in the village unappalled by the awe with which the black veil had impressed all beside herself when the deputies returned without an explanation or even venturing to demand one she with the calm energy of her character determined to chase away the strange cloud that appeared to be settling round mr hooper every moment more darkly than before as his plighted wife it should be her privilege to know what the black veil concealed at the minister's first visit therefore she entered upon the subject with a direct simplicity which made the task easier both for him and her after he had seated himself she fixed her eyes steadfastly upon the veil but could discern nothing of the dreadful gloom that had so overawed the multitude it was but a double fold of crape hanging down from his forehead to his mouth and slightly stirring with his breath no said she aloud and smiling there is nothing terrible in this piece of crape except that it hides a face which i am always glad to look upon come good sir let the sun shine from behind the cloud first lay aside your black veil then tell me why you put it on mr hooper's smile glimmered faintly there is an hour to come said he when all of us shall cast aside our veils take it not amiss beloved friend if i wear this piece of crape till then your words are a mystery too returned the young lady take away the veil from them at least elizabeth i will said he so far as my vow may suffer me know then this veil is a type and a symbol and i am bound to wear it ever both in light and darkness in solitude and before the gaze of multitudes and as with strangers so with my familiar friends no mortal eye will see it withdrawn this dismal shade must separate me from the world even you elizabeth can never come behind it what grievous affliction hath befallen you she earnestly inquired that you should thus darken your eyes forever if it be a sign of mourning replied mr hooper i perhaps like most other mortals have sorrows dark enough to be typified by a black veil but what if the world will not believe that it is the type of an innocent sorrow urged elizabeth beloved and respected as you are there may be whispers that you hide your face under the consciousness of secret sin for the sake of your holy office do away this scandal the color rose into her cheeks as she intimated the nature of the rumors that were already abroad in the village but mr hooper's mildness did not forsake him he even smiled again that same sad smile which always appeared like a faint glimmering of light proceeding from the obscurity beneath the veil if i hide my face for sorrow there is cause enough he merely replied and if i cover it for secret sin what mortal might not do the same and with this gentle but unconquerable obstinacy did he resist all her entreaties at length elizabeth sat silent for a few moments she appeared lost in thought considering probably what new methods might be tried to withdraw her lover from so dark a fantasy which if it had no other meaning was perhaps a symptom of mental disease though of a firmer character than his own the tears rolled down her cheeks but in an instant as it were a new feeling took the place of sorrow her eyes were fixed insensibly on the black veil when like a sudden twilight in the air its terrors fell around her she arose and stood trembling before him and do you feel it then at last said he mournfully she made no reply but covered her eyes with her hand and turned to leave the room he rushed forward and caught her arm have patience with me elizabeth cried he passionately do not desert me though this veil must be between us here on earth be mine and hereafter there shall be no veil over my face no darkness between our souls it is but a mortal veil it is not for eternity o you know not how lonely i am and how frightened to be alone behind my black veil do not leave me in this miserable obscurity forever lift the veil but once and look me in the face said she never it cannot be replied mr hooper then farewell said elizabeth she withdrew her arm from his grasp and slowly departed pausing at the door to give one long shuddering gaze that seemed almost to penetrate the mystery of the black veil but even amid his grief mr hooper smiled to think that only a material emblem had separated him from happiness though the horrors which it shadowed forth must be drawn darkly between the fondest of lovers from that time no attempts were made to remove mr hooper's black veil or by a direct appeal to discover the secret which it was supposed to hide by persons who claimed a superiority to popular prejudice it was reckoned merely an eccentric whim such as often mingles with the sober actions of men otherwise rational and tinges them all with its own semblance of insanity but with the multitude good mr hooper was irreparably a bugbear he could not walk the street with any peace of mind so conscious was he that the gentle and timid would turn aside to avoid him and that others would make it a point of hardihood to throw themselves in his way the impertinence of the latter class compelled him to give up his customary walk at sunset to the burial ground for when he leaned pensively over the gate there would always be faces behind the gravestones peeping at his black veil a fable went the rounds that the stare of the dead people drove him thence it grieved him to the very depth of his kind heart to observe how the children fled from his approach breaking up their merriest sports while his melancholy figure was yet afar off their instinctive dread caused him to feel more strongly than aught else that a preternatural horror was interwoven with the threads of the black crape in truth his own antipathy to the veil was known to be so great that he never willingly passed before a mirror nor stooped to drink at a still fountain"
