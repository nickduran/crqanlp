"1" "can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes mr tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced catherine feared as she listened to their discourse that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others what are you thinking of so earnestly said he as they walked back to the ballroom not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory catherine coloured and said i was not thinking of anything that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me well then i will not thank you for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much they danced again and when the assembly closed parted on the lady's side at least with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance whether she thought of him so much while she drank her warm wine and water and prepared herself for bed as to dream of him when there cannot be ascertained but i hope it was no more than in a slight slumber or a morning doze at most for if it be true as a celebrated writer has maintained that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her how proper mr tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered mr allen's head but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was and had been assured of mr tilney's being a clergyman and of a very respectable family in gloucestershire chapter 4 with more than usual eagerness did catherine hasten to the pump room the next day secure within herself of seeing mr tilney there before the morning were over and ready to meet him with a smile but no smile was demanded mr tilney did not appear every creature in bath except himself was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours crowds of people were every moment passing in and out up the steps and down people whom nobody cared about and nobody wanted to see and he only was absent what a delightful place bath is said mrs allen as they sat down near the great clock after parading the room till they were tired and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here this sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that mrs allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now but we are told to despair of nothing we would attain as unwearied diligence our point would gain and the unwearied diligence with which she had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its just reward for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady of about her own age who was sitting by her and had been looking at her attentively for several minutes addressed her with great complaisance in these words i think madam i cannot be mistaken it is a long time since i had the pleasure of seeing you but is not your name allen this question answered as it readily was the stranger pronounced hers to be thorpe and mrs allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages and that many years ago their joy on this meeting was very great as well it might since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years compliments on good looks now passed and after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together how little they had thought of meeting in bath and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families sisters and cousins talking both together far more ready to give than to receive information and each hearing very little of what the other said mrs thorpe however had one great advantage as a talker over mrs allen in a family of children and when she expatiated on the talents of her sons and the beauty of her daughters when she related their different situations and views that john was at oxford edward at merchant taylors and william at sea and all of them more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were mrs allen had no similar information to give no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions consoling herself however with the discovery which her keen eye soon made that the lace on mrs thorpe's pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own here come my dear girls cried mrs thorpe pointing at three smart looking females who arm in arm were then moving towards her my dear mrs allen i long to introduce them they will be so delighted to see you the tallest is isabella my eldest is not she a fine young woman the others are very much admired too but i believe isabella is the handsomest the miss thorpes were introduced and miss morland who had been for a short time forgotten was introduced likewise the name seemed to strike them all and after speaking to her with great civility the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest how excessively like her brother miss morland is the very picture of him indeed cried the mother and i should have known her anywhere for his sister was repeated by them all two or three times over for a moment catherine was surprised but mrs thorpe and her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance with mr james morland before she remembered that her eldest brother had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college of the name of thorpe and that he had spent the last week of the christmas vacation with his family near london the whole being explained many obliging things were said by the miss thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her of being considered as already friends through the friendship of their brothers etc which catherine heard with pleasure and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command and as the first proof of amity she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest miss thorpe and take a turn with her about the room catherine was delighted with this extension of her bath acquaintance and almost forgot mr tilney while she talked to miss thorpe friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love their conversation turned upon those subjects of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies such as dress balls flirtations and quizzes miss thorpe however being four years older than miss morland and at least four years better informed had a very decided advantage in discussing such points she could compare the balls of bath with those of tunbridge its fashions with the fashions of london could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd these powers received due admiration from catherine to whom they were entirely new and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity had not the easy gaiety of miss thorpe's manners and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her softened down every feeling of awe and left nothing but tender affection their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump room but required when they all quitted it together that miss thorpe should accompany miss morland to the very door of mr allen's house and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands after learning to their mutual relief that they should see each other across the theatre at night and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning catherine then ran directly upstairs and watched miss thorpe's progress down the street from the drawing room window admired the graceful spirit of her walk the fashionable air of her figure and dress and felt grateful as well she might for the chance which had procured her such a friend mrs thorpe was a widow and not a very rich one she was a good humoured well meaning woman and a very indulgent mother her eldest daughter had great personal beauty and the younger ones by pretending to be as handsome as their sister imitating her air and dressing in the same style did very well this brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from mrs thorpe herself of her past adventures and sufferings which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth and conversations which had passed twenty years before be minutely repeated chapter 5 catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening in returning the nods and smiles of miss thorpe though they certainly claimed much of her leisure as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for mr tilney in every box which her eye could reach but she looked in vain mr tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump room she hoped to be more fortunate the next day and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning she hardly felt a doubt of it for a fine sunday in bath empties every house of its inhabitants and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is as soon as divine service was over the thorpes and allens eagerly joined each other and after staying long enough in the pump room to discover that the crowd was insupportable and that there was not a genteel face to be seen which everybody discovers every sunday throughout the season they hastened away to the crescent to breathe the fresh air of better company here catherine and isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation they talked much and with much enjoyment but again was catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner he was nowhere to be met with every search for him was equally unsuccessful in morning lounges or evening assemblies neither at the upper nor lower rooms at dressed or undressed balls was he perceivable nor among the walkers the horsemen or the curricle drivers of the morning his name was not in the pump room book and curiosity could do no more he must be gone from bath yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short this sort of mysteriousness which is always so becoming in a hero threw a fresh grace in catherine's imagination around his person and manners and increased her anxiety to know more of him from the thorpes she could learn nothing for they had been only two days in bath before they met with mrs allen it was a subject however in which she often indulged with her fair friend from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear catherine and would therefore shortly return she liked him the better for being a clergyman for she must confess herself very partial to the profession and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it perhaps catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love or the duties of friendship to know when delicate raillery was properly called for or when a confidence should be forced mrs allen was now quite happy quite satisfied with bath she had found some acquaintance had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend and as the completion of good fortune had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself her daily expressions were no longer i wish we had some acquaintance in bath they were changed into how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families as her young charge and isabella themselves could be never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of mrs thorpe in what they called conversation but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion and not often any resemblance of subject for mrs thorpe talked chiefly of her children and mrs allen of her gowns the progress of the friendship between catherine and isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves they called each other by their christian name were always arm in arm when they walked pinned up each other's train for the dance and were not to be divided in the set and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt and shut themselves up to read novels together yes novels for i will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel writers of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances to the number of which they are themselves adding joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine who if she accidentally take up a novel is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust alas if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another from whom can she expect protection and regard i cannot approve of it let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans let us not desert one another we are an injured body although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world no species of composition has been so much decried from pride ignorance or fashion our foes are almost as many as our readers and while the abilities of the nine hundredth abridger of the history of england or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of milton pope and prior with a paper from the spectator and a chapter from sterne are eulogized by a thousand pens there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist and of slighting the performances which have only genius wit and taste to recommend them i am no novel reader i seldom look into novels do not imagine that i often read novels it is really very well for a novel such is the common cant and what are you reading miss oh it is only a novel replies the young lady while she lays down her book with affected indifference or momentary shame it is only cecilia or camilla or belinda or in short only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature the happiest delineation of its varieties the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language now had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the spectator instead of such a work how proudly would she have produced the book and told its name though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances unnatural characters and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living and their language too frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it chapter 6 the following conversation which took place between the two friends in the pump room one morning after an acquaintance of eight or nine days is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment and of the delicacy discretion originality of thought and literary taste which marked the reasonableness of that attachment they met by appointment and as isabella had arrived nearly five minutes before her friend her first address naturally was my dearest creature what can have made you so late i have been waiting for you at least this age have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long oh these ten ages at least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go and sit down at the other end of the room and enjoy ourselves i have an hundred things to say to you in the first place i was so afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window in milsom street just now very like yours only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green i quite longed for it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning have you gone on with udolpho yes i have been reading it ever since i woke and i am got to the black veil are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world are not you wild to know oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina's skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world dear creature how much i am obliged to you and when you have finished udolpho we will read the italian together and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you have you indeed how glad i am what are they all i will read you their names directly here they are in my pocketbook castle of wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer of the black forest midnight bell orphan of the rhine and horrid mysteries those will last us some time yes pretty well but are they all horrid are you sure they are all horrid yes quite sure for a particular friend of mine a miss andrews a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her she is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her as beautiful as an angel and i am so vexed with the men for not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it scold them do you scold them for not admiring her yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men oh dear cried catherine colouring how can you say so i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you catherine coloured and disclaimed again isabella laughed it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody's admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you speaking more seriously your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina's skeleton behind it it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head tonight i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of that sometimes you know but it does not signify if they do said catherine very innocently signify oh heavens i make it a rule never to mind what they say they are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance are they well i never observed that they always behave very well to me oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description betray you what do you mean nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject catherine in some amazement complied and after remaining a few moments silent was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world laurentina's skeleton when her friend prevented her by saying for heaven's sake let us move away from this end of the room do you know there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour they really put me quite out of countenance let us go and look at the arrivals they will hardly follow us there away they walked to the book and while isabella examined the names it was catherine's employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men they are not coming this way are they i hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us pray let me know if they are coming i am determined i will not look up in a few moments catherine with unaffected pleasure assured her that she need not be longer uneasy as the gentlemen had just left the pump room and which way are they gone said isabella turning hastily round one was a very good looking young man they went towards the church yard well i am amazingly glad i have got rid of them and now what say you to going to edgar's buildings with me and looking at my new hat you said you should like to see it catherine readily agreed only she added perhaps we may overtake the two young men oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass by them presently and i am dying to show you my hat but if we only wait a few minutes there will be no danger of our seeing them at all i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion of treating men with such respect that is the way to spoil them catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning and therefore to show the independence of miss thorpe and her resolution of humbling the sex they set off immediately as fast as they could walk in pursuit of the two young men chapter 7 half a minute conducted them through the pump yard to the archway opposite union passage but here they were stopped everybody acquainted with bath may remember the difficulties of crossing cheap street at this point it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature so unfortunately connected with the great london and oxford roads and the principal inn of the city that a day never passes in which parties of ladies however important their business whether in quest of pastry millinery or even as in the present case of young men are not detained on one side or other by carriages horsemen or carts this evil had been felt and lamented at least three times a day by isabella since her residence in bath and she was now fated to feel and lament it once more for at the very moment of coming opposite to union passage and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the crowds and threading the gutters of that interesting alley they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig driven along on bad pavement by a most knowing looking coachman with all the vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself his companion and his horse oh these odious gigs said isabella looking up how i detest them but this detestation though so just was of short duration for she looked again and exclaimed delightful mr morland and my brother good heaven tis james was uttered at the same moment by catherine and on catching the young men's eyes"
