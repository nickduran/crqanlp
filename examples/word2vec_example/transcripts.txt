x 1 for fodder keep turning the land and always put up more hay than you need don't grudge your mother a little time for plowing her garden and setting out fruit trees even if it comes in a busy season she has been a good mother to you and she has always missed the old country when they went back to the kitchen the boys sat down silently at the table throughout the meal they looked down at their plates and did not lift their red eyes they did not eat much although they had been working in the cold all day and there was a rabbit stewed in gravy for supper and prune pies john bergson had married beneath him but he had married a good housewife mrs bergson was a fair skinned corpulent woman heavy and placid like her son oscar but there was something comfortable about her perhaps it was her own love of comfort for eleven years she had worthily striven to maintain some semblance of household order amid conditions that made order very difficult habit was very strong with mrs bergson and her unremitting efforts to repeat the routine of her old life among new surroundings had done a great deal to keep the family from disintegrating morally and getting careless in their ways the bergsons had a log house for instance only because mrs bergson would not live in a sod house she missed the fish diet of her own country and twice every summer she sent the boys to the river twenty miles to the southward to fish for channel cat when the children were little she used to load them all into the wagon the baby in its crib and go fishing herself alexandra often said that if her mother were cast upon a desert island she would thank god for her deliverance make a garden and find something to preserve preserving was almost a mania with mrs bergson stout as she was she roamed the scrubby banks of norway creek looking for fox grapes and goose plums like a wild creature in search of prey she made a yellow jam of the insipid ground cherries that grew on the prairie flavoring it with lemon peel and she made a sticky dark conserve of garden tomatoes she had experimented even with the rank buffalo pea and she could not see a fine bronze cluster of them without shaking her head and murmuring what a pity when there was nothing more to preserve she began to pickle the amount of sugar she used in these processes was sometimes a serious drain upon the family resources she was a good mother but she was glad when her children were old enough not to be in her way in the kitchen she had never quite forgiven john bergson for bringing her to the end of the earth but now that she was there she wanted to be let alone to reconstruct her old life in so far as that was possible she could still take some comfort in the world if she had bacon in the cave glass jars on the shelves and sheets in the press she disapproved of all her neighbors because of their slovenly housekeeping and the women thought her very proud once when mrs bergson on her way to norway creek stopped to see old mrs lee the old woman hid in the haymow for fear mis bergson would catch her barefoot iii one sunday afternoon in july six months after john bergson's death carl was sitting in the doorway of the linstrum kitchen dreaming over an illustrated paper when he heard the rattle of a wagon along the hill road looking up he recognized the bergsons team with two seats in the wagon which meant they were off for a pleasure excursion oscar and lou on the front seat wore their cloth hats and coats never worn except on sundays and emil on the second seat with alexandra sat proudly in his new trousers made from a pair of his father's and a pink striped shirt with a wide ruffled collar oscar stopped the horses and waved to carl who caught up his hat and ran through the melon patch to join them want to go with us lou called we're going to crazy ivar's to buy a hammock sure carl ran up panting and clambering over the wheel sat down beside emil i've always wanted to see ivar's pond they say it's the biggest in all the country aren't you afraid to go to ivar's in that new shirt emil he might want it and take it right off your back emil grinned i'd be awful scared to go he admitted if you big boys weren't along to take care of me did you ever hear him howl carl people say sometimes he runs about the country howling at night because he is afraid the lord will destroy him mother thinks he must have done something awful wicked lou looked back and winked at carl what would you do emil if you was out on the prairie by yourself and seen him coming emil stared maybe i could hide in a badger hole he suggested doubtfully but suppose there wasn't any badger hole lou persisted would you run no i'd be too scared to run emil admitted mournfully twisting his fingers i guess i'd sit right down on the ground and say my prayers the big boys laughed and oscar brandished his whip over the broad backs of the horses he wouldn't hurt you emil said carl persuasively he came to doctor our mare when she ate green corn and swelled up most as big as the water tank he petted her just like you do your cats i couldn't understand much he said for he don't talk any english but he kept patting her and groaning as if he had the pain himself and saying there now sister that's easier that's better lou and oscar laughed and emil giggled delightedly and looked up at his sister i don't think he knows anything at all about doctoring said oscar scornfully they say when horses have distemper he takes the medicine himself and then prays over the horses alexandra spoke up that's what the crows said but he cured their horses all the same some days his mind is cloudy like but if you can get him on a clear day you can learn a great deal from him he understands animals didn't i see him take the horn off the berquist's cow when she had torn it loose and went crazy she was tearing all over the place knocking herself against things and at last she ran out on the roof of the old dugout and her legs went through and there she stuck bellowing ivar came running with his white bag and the moment he got to her she was quiet and let him saw her horn off and daub the place with tar emil had been watching his sister his face reflecting the sufferings of the cow and then didn't it hurt her any more he asked alexandra patted him no not any more and in two days they could use her milk again the road to ivar's homestead was a very poor one he had settled in the rough country across the county line where no one lived but some russians half a dozen families who dwelt together in one long house divided off like barracks ivar had explained his choice by saying that the fewer neighbors he had the fewer temptations nevertheless when one considered that his chief business was horse doctoring it seemed rather short sighted of him to live in the most inaccessible place he could find the bergson wagon lurched along over the rough hummocks and grass banks followed the bottom of winding draws or skirted the margin of wide lagoons where the golden coreopsis grew up out of the clear water and the wild ducks rose with a whirr of wings lou looked after them helplessly i wish i'd brought my gun anyway alexandra he said fretfully i could have hidden it under the straw in the bottom of the wagon then we'd have had to lie to ivar besides they say he can smell dead birds and if he knew we wouldn't get anything out of him not even a hammock i want to talk to him and he won't talk sense if he's angry it makes him foolish lou sniffed whoever heard of him talking sense anyhow i'd rather have ducks for supper than crazy ivar's tongue emil was alarmed oh but lou you don't want to make him mad he might howl they all laughed again and oscar urged the horses up the crumbling side of a clay bank they had left the lagoons and the red grass behind them in crazy ivar's country the grass was short and gray the draws deeper than they were in the bergsons neighborhood and the land was all broken up into hillocks and clay ridges the wild flowers disappeared and only in the bottom of the draws and gullies grew a few of the very toughest and hardiest shoestring and ironweed and snow on the mountain look look emil there's ivar's big pond alexandra pointed to a shining sheet of water that lay at the bottom of a shallow draw at one end of the pond was an earthen dam planted with green willow bushes and above it a door and a single window were set into the hillside you would not have seen them at all but for the reflection of the sunlight upon the four panes of window glass and that was all you saw not a shed not a corral not a well not even a path broken in the curly grass but for the piece of rusty stovepipe sticking up through the sod you could have walked over the roof of ivar's dwelling without dreaming that you were near a human habitation ivar had lived for three years in the clay bank without defiling the face of nature any more than the coyote that had lived there before him had done when the bergsons drove over the hill ivar was sitting in the doorway of his house reading the norwegian bible he was a queerly shaped old man with a thick powerful body set on short bow legs his shaggy white hair falling in a thick mane about his ruddy cheeks made him look older than he was he was barefoot but he wore a clean shirt of unbleached cotton open at the neck he always put on a clean shirt when sunday morning came round though he never went to church he had a peculiar religion of his own and could not get on with any of the denominations often he did not see anybody from one week's end to another he kept a calendar and every morning he checked off a day so that he was never in any doubt as to which day of the week it was ivar hired himself out in threshing and corn husking time and he doctored sick animals when he was sent for when he was at home he made hammocks out of twine and committed chapters of the bible to memory ivar found contentment in the solitude he had sought out for himself he disliked the litter of human dwellings the broken food the bits of broken china the old wash boilers and tea kettles thrown into the sunflower patch he preferred the cleanness and tidiness of the wild sod he always said that the badgers had cleaner houses than people and that when he took a housekeeper her name would be mrs badger he best expressed his preference for his wild homestead by saying that his bible seemed truer to him there if one stood in the doorway of his cave and looked off at the rough land the smiling sky the curly grass white in the hot sunlight if one listened to the rapturous song of the lark the drumming of the quail the burr of the locust against that vast silence one understood what ivar meant on this sunday afternoon his face shone with happiness he closed the book on his knee keeping the place with his horny finger and repeated softly he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her house the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies before he opened his bible again ivar heard the bergsons wagon approaching and he sprang up and ran toward it no guns no guns he shouted waving his arms distractedly no ivar no guns alexandra called reassuringly he dropped his arms and went up to the wagon smiling amiably and looking at them out of his pale blue eyes we want to buy a hammock if you have one alexandra explained and my little brother here wants to see your big pond where so many birds come ivar smiled foolishly and began rubbing the horses noses and feeling about their mouths behind the bits not many birds just now a few ducks this morning and some snipe come to drink but there was a crane last week she spent one night and came back the next evening i don't know why it is not her season of course many of them go over in the fall then the pond is full of strange voices every night alexandra translated for carl who looked thoughtful ask him alexandra if it is true that a sea gull came here once i have heard so she had some difficulty in making the old man understand he looked puzzled at first then smote his hands together as he remembered oh yes yes a big white bird with long wings and pink feet my what a voice she had she came in the afternoon and kept flying about the pond and screaming until dark she was in trouble of some sort but i could not understand her she was going over to the other ocean maybe and did not know how far it was she was afraid of never getting there she was more mournful than our birds here she cried in the night she saw the light from my window and darted up to it maybe she thought my house was a boat she was such a wild thing next morning when the sun rose i went out to take her food but she flew up into the sky and went on her way ivar ran his fingers through his thick hair i have many strange birds stop with me here they come from very far away and are great company i hope you boys never shoot wild birds lou and oscar grinned and ivar shook his bushy head yes i know boys are thoughtless but these wild things are god's birds he watches over them and counts them as we do our cattle christ says so in the new testament now ivar lou asked may we water our horses at your pond and give them some feed it's a bad road to your place yes yes it is the old man scrambled about and began to loose the tugs a bad road eh girls and the bay with a colt at home oscar brushed the old man aside we'll take care of the horses ivar you'll be finding some disease on them alexandra wants to see your hammocks ivar led alexandra and emil to his little cave house he had but one room neatly plastered and whitewashed and there was a wooden floor there was a kitchen stove a table covered with oilcloth two chairs a clock a calendar a few books on the window shelf nothing more but the place was as clean as a cupboard but where do you sleep ivar emil asked looking about ivar unslung a hammock from a hook on the wall in it was rolled a buffalo robe there my son a hammock is a good bed and in winter i wrap up in this skin where i go to work the beds are not half so easy as this by this time emil had lost all his timidity he thought a cave a very superior kind of house there was something pleasantly unusual about it and about ivar do the birds know you will be kind to them ivar is that why so many come he asked ivar sat down on the floor and tucked his feet under him see little brother they have come from a long way and they are very tired from up there where they are flying our country looks dark and flat they must have water to drink and to bathe in before they can go on with their journey they look this way and that and far below them they see something shining like a piece of glass set in the dark earth that is my pond they come to it and are not disturbed maybe i sprinkle a little corn they tell the other birds and next year more come this way they have their roads up there as we have down here emil rubbed his knees thoughtfully and is that true ivar about the head ducks falling back when they are tired and the hind ones taking their place yes the point of the wedge gets the worst of it they cut the wind they can only stand it there a little while half an hour maybe then they fall back and the wedge splits a little while the rear ones come up the middle to the front then it closes up and they fly on with a new edge they are always changing like that up in the air never any confusion just like soldiers who have been drilled alexandra had selected her hammock by the time the boys came up from the pond they would not come in but sat in the shade of the bank outside while alexandra and ivar talked about the birds and about his housekeeping and why he never ate meat fresh or salt alexandra was sitting on one of the wooden chairs her arms resting on the table ivar was sitting on the floor at her feet ivar she said suddenly beginning to trace the pattern on the oilcloth with her forefinger i came to day more because i wanted to talk to you than because i wanted to buy a hammock yes the old man scraped his bare feet on the plank floor we have a big bunch of hogs ivar i wouldn't sell in the spring when everybody advised me to and now so many people are losing their hogs that i am frightened what can be done ivar's little eyes began to shine they lost their vagueness you feed them swill and such stuff of course and sour milk oh yes and keep them in a stinking pen i tell you sister the hogs of this country are put upon they become unclean like the hogs in the bible if you kept your chickens like that what would happen you have a little sorghum patch maybe put a fence around it and turn the hogs in build a shed to give them shade a thatch on poles let the boys haul water to them in barrels clean water and plenty get them off the old stinking ground and do not let them go back there until winter give them only grain and clean feed such as you would give horses or cattle hogs do not like to be filthy the boys outside the door had been listening lou nudged his brother come the horses are done eating let's hitch up and get out of here he'll fill her full of notions she'll be for having the pigs sleep with us next oscar grunted and got up carl who could not understand what ivar said saw that the two boys were displeased they did not mind hard work but they hated experiments and could never see the use of taking pains even lou who was more elastic than his older brother disliked to do anything different from their neighbors he felt that it made them conspicuous and gave people a chance to talk about them once they were on the homeward road the boys forgot their ill humor and joked about ivar and his birds alexandra did not propose any reforms in the care of the pigs and they hoped she had forgotten ivar's talk they agreed that he was crazier than ever and would never be able to prove up on his land because he worked it so little alexandra privately resolved that she would have a talk with ivar about this and stir him up the boys persuaded carl to stay for supper and go swimming in the pasture pond after dark that evening after she had washed the supper dishes alexandra sat down on the kitchen doorstep while her mother was mixing the bread it was a still deep breathing summer night full of the smell of the hay fields sounds of laughter and splashing came up from the pasture and when the moon rose rapidly above the bare rim of the prairie the pond glittered like polished metal and she could see the flash of white bodies as the boys ran about the edge or jumped into the water alexandra watched the shimmering pool dreamily but eventually her eyes went back to the sorghum patch south of the barn where she was planning to make her new pig corral iv for the first three years after john bergson's death the affairs of his family prospered then came the hard times that brought every one on the divide to the brink of despair three years of drouth and failure the last struggle of a wild soil against the encroaching plowshare the first of these fruitless summers the bergson boys bore courageously the failure of the corn crop made labor cheap lou and oscar hired two men and put in bigger crops than ever before they lost everything they spent the whole country was discouraged farmers who were already in debt had to give up their land a few foreclosures demoralized the county the settlers sat about on the wooden sidewalks in the little town and told each other that the country was never meant for men to live in the thing to do was to get back to iowa to illinois to any place that had been proved habitable the bergson boys certainly would have been happier with their uncle otto in the bakery shop in chicago like most of their neighbors they were meant to follow in paths already marked out for them not to break trails in a new country a steady job a few holidays nothing to think about and they would have been very happy it was no fault of theirs that they had been dragged into the wilderness when they were little boys a pioneer should have imagination should be able to enjoy the idea of things more than the things themselves the second of these barren summers was passing one september afternoon alexandra had gone over to the garden across the draw to dig sweet potatoes they had been thriving upon the weather that was fatal to everything else but when carl linstrum came up the garden rows to find her she was not working she was standing lost in thought leaning upon her pitchfork her sunbonnet lying beside her on the ground the dry garden patch smelled of drying vines and was strewn with yellow seed cucumbers and pumpkins and citrons at one end next the rhubarb grew feathery asparagus with red berries down the middle of the garden was a row of gooseberry and currant bushes a few tough zenias and marigolds and a row of scarlet sage bore witness to the buckets of water that mrs bergson had carried there after sundown against the prohibition of her sons carl came quietly and slowly up the garden path looking intently at alexandra she did not hear him she was standing perfectly still with that serious ease so characteristic of her her thick reddish braids twisted about her head fairly burned in the sunlight the air was cool enough to make the warm sun pleasant on one's back and shoulders and so clear that the eye could follow a hawk up and up into the blazing blue depths of the sky even carl never a very cheerful boy and considerably darkened by these last two bitter years loved the country on days like this felt something strong and young and wild come out of it that laughed at care alexandra he said as he approached her i want to talk to you let's sit down by the gooseberry bushes he picked up her sack of potatoes and they crossed the garden boys gone to town he asked as he sank down on the warm sun baked earth well we have made up our minds at last alexandra we are really going away she looked at him as if she were a little frightened really carl is it settled yes father has heard from st louis and they will give him back his old job in the cigar factory he must be there by the first of november they are taking on new men then we will sell the place for whatever we can get and auction the stock we haven't enough to ship i am going to learn engraving with a german engraver there and then try to get work in chicago alexandra's hands dropped in her lap her eyes became dreamy and filled with tears carl's sensitive lower lip trembled he scratched in the soft earth beside him with a stick that's all i hate about it alexandra he said slowly you've stood by us through so much and helped father out so many times and now it seems as if we were running off and leaving you to face the worst of it but it isn't as if we could really ever be of any help to you we are only one more drag one more thing you look out for and feel responsible for father was never meant for a farmer you know that and i hate it we'd only get in deeper and deeper yes yes carl i know you are wasting your life here you are able to do much better things you are nearly nineteen now and i wouldn't have you stay i've always hoped you would get away but i can't help feeling scared when i think how i will miss you more than you will ever know she brushed the tears from her cheeks not trying to hide them but alexandra he said sadly and wistfully i've never been any real help to you beyond sometimes trying to keep the boys in a good humor alexandra smiled and shook her head oh it's not that nothing like that it's by understanding me and the boys and mother that you've helped me i expect that is the only way one person ever really can help another i think you are about the only one that ever helped me somehow it will take more courage to bear your going than everything that has happened before carl looked at the ground you see we've all depended so on you he said even father he makes me laugh when anything comes up he always says i wonder what the bergsons are going to do about that i guess i'll go and ask her i'll never forget that time when we first came here and our horse had the colic and i ran over to your place your father was away and you came home with me and showed father how to let the wind out of the horse you were only a little girl then but you knew ever so much more about farm work than poor father you remember how homesick i used to get and what long talks we used to have coming from school we've someway always felt alike about things yes that's it we've liked the same things and we've liked them together without anybody else knowing and we've had good times hunting for christmas trees and going for ducks and making our plum wine together every year we've never either of us had any other close friend and now alexandra wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron and now i must remember that you are going where you will have many friends and will find the work you were meant to do but you'll write to me carl that will mean a great deal to me here i'll write as long as i live cried the boy impetuously and i'll be working for you as much as for myself alexandra i want to do something you'll like and be proud of i'm a fool here but i know i can do something he sat up and frowned at the red grass alexandra sighed how discouraged the boys will be when they hear they always come home from town discouraged anyway so many people are trying to leave the country and they talk to our boys and make them low spirited i'm afraid they are beginning to feel hard toward me because i won't listen to any talk about
x 1 now dropped the cloak and forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon myrtles and looking glass prosily as the woman who owed him twopence they placed the calf beside its mother again took up the lantern and went out the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a nebula gabriel oak returned to his flock chapter iii a girl on horseback conversation the sluggish day began to break even its position terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest and for no particular reason save that the incident of the night had occurred there oak went again into the plantation lingering and musing here he heard the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill and soon there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on its back ascending by the path leading past the cattle shed she was the young woman of the night before gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the wind possibly she had come to look for it he hastily scanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it found the hat among the leaves gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his hut here he ensconced himself and peeped through the loophole in the direction of the riders approach she came up and looked around then on the other side of the hedge gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an unexpected per formance induced him to suspend the action for the present the path after passing the cowshed bisected the plantation it was not a bridle path merely a pedestrian's track and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them the girl who wore no riding habit looked around for a moment as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony's back her head over its tail her feet against its shoulders and her eyes to the sky the rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a kingfisher its noiselessness that of a hawk gabriel's eyes had scarcely been able to follow her the tall lank pony seemed used to such doings and ambled along unconcerned thus she passed under the level boughs the performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse's head and its tail and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the passage of the plantation she began to adopt another even more obviously convenient than the first she had no side saddle and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was un attainable sideways springing to her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling and satisfying her self that nobody was in sight she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle though hardly expected of the woman and trotted off in the direction of tewnell mill oak was amused perhaps a little astonished and hanging up the hat in his hut went again among his ewes an hour passed the girl returned properly seated now with a bag of bran in front of her on nearing the cattle shed she was met by a boy bringing a milking pail who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off the boy led away the horse leaving the pail with the young woman soon soft shirts alternating with loud shirts came in regular succession from within the shed the obvious sounds of a person milking a cow gabriel took the lost hat in his hand and waited beside the path she would follow in leaving the hill she came the pail in one hand hanging against her knee the left arm was extended as a balance enough of it being shown bare to make oak wish that the event ha happened in the summer when the whole would have been revealed there was a bright air and manner about her now by which she seemed to imply that the desirability of her existence could not be questioned and this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive because a beholder felt it to be upon the whole true like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius that which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to recognised power it was with some surprise that she saw gabriel's face rising like the moon behind the hedge the adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her charms to the portrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution than a difference the starting point selected by the judgment was her height she seemed tall but the pail was a small one and the hedge diminutive hence making allowance for error by comparison with these she could have been not above the height to be chosen by women as best all features of consequence were severe and regular it may have been observed by persons who go about the shires with eyes for beauty that in englishwoman a classically formed face is seldom found to be united with a figure of the same pattern the highly finished features being generally too large for the remainder of the frame that a graceful and proportionate figure of eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves without throwing a nymphean tissue over a milkmaid let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out of place and looked at her proportions with a long consciousness of pleasure from the contours of her figure in its upper part she must have had a beautiful neck and shoulders but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them had she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her head into a bush yet she was not a shy girl by any means it was merely her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen higher than they do it in towns that the girl's thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as she caught oak's eyes conning the same page was natural and almost certain the self consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little more pronounced dignity if a little less rays of male vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural districts she brushed hers with her hand as if gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual touch and the free air of her previous movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of itself yet it was the man who blushed the maid not at all i found a hat said oak it is mine said she and from a sense of proportion kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh dis tinctly it flew away last night one o'clock this morning well it was she was surprised how did you know she said i was here you are farmer oak are you not that or thereabouts i'm lately come to this place a large farm she inquired casting her eyes round and swinging back her hair which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass but it being now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent curves with a colour of their own no not large about a hundred in speaking of farms the word acres is omitted by the natives by analogy to such old expressions as a stag of ten i wanted my hat this morning she went on i had to ride to tewnell mill yes you had how do you know i saw you where she inquired a misgiving bringing every muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill here going through the plantation and all down the hill said farmer oak with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some matter in his mind as he gazed at a remote point in the direction named and then turned back to meet his colloquist's eyes a perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a theft recollection of the strange antics she had indulged in when passing through the trees was suc ceeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation and that by a hot face it was a time to see a woman redden who was not given to reddening as a rule not a point in the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose colour from the maiden's blush through all varieties of the provence down to the crimson tuscany the countenance of oak's acquaintance quickly graduated whereupon he in con siderateness turned away his head the sympathetic man still looked the other way and wondered when she would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again he heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze and looked she had gone away with an air between that of tragedy and comedy gabriel returned to his work five mornings and evenings passed the young woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one but never allowed her vision to stray in the direction of oak's person his want of tact had deeply offended her not by seeing what he could not help but by letting her know that he had seen it for as without law there is no sin without eyes there is no indecorum and she appeared to feel that gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman without her own connivance it was food for great regret with him it was also a contretemps which touched into life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction the acquaintanceship might however have ended in a slow forgetting but for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week one afternoon it began to freeze and the frost increased with evening which drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds it was a time when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets when round the drawing room fire of a thick walled mansion the sitters backs are cold even whilst their faces are all aglow many a small bird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs as the milking hour drew near oak kept his usual watch upon the cowshed at last he felt cold and shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon the stove the wind came in at the bottom of the door and to prevent it oak laid a sack there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the south then the wind spouted in at a ventilating hole of which there was one on each side of the hut gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept open that chosen being always on the side away from the wind closing the slide to windward he turned to open the other on second thoughts the farmer con sidered that he would first sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two till the temperature of the hut was a little raised he sat down his head began to ache in an unwonted manner and fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights oak decided to get up open the slide and then allow himself to fall asleep he fell asleep however without having performed the necessary preliminary how long he remained unconscious gabriel never knew during the first stages of his return to percep tion peculiar deeds seemed to be in course of enactment his dog was howling his head was aching fearfully somebody was pulling him about hands were loosening his neckerchief on opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness the young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white teeth was beside him more than this astonishingly more his head was upon her lap his face and neck were disagreeably wet and her fingers were unbuttoning his collar whatever is the matter said oak vacantly she seemed to experience mirth but of too insignifi cant a kind to start enjoyment nothing now she answered since you are not dead it is a wonder you were not suffocated in this hut of yours ah the hut murmured gabriel i gave ten pounds for that hut but i'll sell it and sit under thatched hurdles as they did in old times curl up to sleep in a lock of straw it played me nearly the same trick the other day gabriel by way of emphasis brought down his fist upon the floor it was not exactly the fault of the hut she ob served in a tone which showed her to be that novelty among women one who finished a thought before beginning the sentence which was to convey it you should i think have considered and not have been so foolish as to leave the slides closed yes i suppose i should said oak absently he was endeavouring to catch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her his head upon her dress before the event passed on into the heap of bygone things he wished she knew his impressions but he would as soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of attempting to convey the intangibilities of his feeling in the coarse meshes of language so he remained silent she made him sit up and then oak began wiping his face and shaking himself like a samson how can i thank ee he said at last gratefully some of the natural rusty red having returned to his face oh never mind that said the girl smiling and allowing her smile to hold good for gabriel's next remark whatever that might prove to be how did you find me i heard your dog howling and scratching at the door of the hut when i came to the milking it was so lucky daisy's milking is almost over for the season and i shall not come here after this week or the next the dog saw me and jumped over to me and laid hold of my skirt i came across and looked round the hut the very first thing to see if the slides were closed my uncle has a hut like this one and i have heard him tell his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide open i opened the door and there you were like dead i threw the milk over you as there was no water forgetting it was warm and no use i wonder if i should have died gabriel said in a low voice which was rather meant to travel back to himself than to her o no the girl replied she seemed to prefer a less tragic probability to have saved a man from death involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of such a deed and she shunned it i believe you saved my life miss i don't know your name i know your aunt's but not yours i would just as soon not tell it rather not there is no reason either why i should as you probably will never have much to do with me still i should like to know you can inquire at my aunt's she will tell you my name is gabriel oak and mine isn't you seem fond of yours in speaking it so decisively gabriel oak you see it is the only one i shall ever have and i must make the most of it i always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable i should think you might soon get a new one mercy how many opinions you keep about you concerning other people gabriel oak well miss excuse the words i thought you would like them but i can't match you i know in napping out my mind upon my tongue i never was very clever in my inside but i thank you come give me your hand she hesitated somewhat disconcerted at oak's old fashioned earnest conclusion to a dialogue lightly carried on very well she said and gave him her hand compressing her lips to a demure impassivity he held it but an instant and in his fear of being too demonstrative swerved to the opposite extreme touching her fingers with the lightness of a small hearted person i am sorry he said the instant after what for you may have it again if you like there it is she gave him her hand again oak held it longer this time indeed curiously long how soft it is being winter time too not chapped or rough or anything he said there that's long enough said she though with out pulling it away but i suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it you may if you want to i wasn't thinking of any such thing said gabriel simply but i will that you won't she snatched back her hand gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact now find out my name she said teasingly and withdrew chapter iv gabriel's resolve the visit the mistake the only superiority in women that is tolerable to the rival sex is as a rule that of the unconscious kind but a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the subordinated man this well favoured and comely girl soon made appre ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young farmer oak love being an extremely exacting usurer a sense of exorbitant profit spiritually by an exchange of hearts being at the bottom of pure passions as that of exorbi tant profit bodily or materially is at the bottom of those of lower atmosphere every morning oak's feelings were as sensitive as the money market in calculations upon his chances his dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in which oak waited for the girl's presence that the farmer was quite struck with the resemblance felt it lowering and would not look at the dog however he continued to watch through the hedge for her regular coming and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened without any corresponding effect being produced upon herself oak had nothing finished and ready to say as yet and not being able to frame love phrases which end where they begin passionate tales full of sound and fury signifying nothing he said no word at all by making inquiries he found that the girl's name was bathsheba everdene and that the cow would go dry in about seven days he dreaded the eight day at last the eighth day came the cow had ceased to give milk for that year and bathsheba everdene came up the hill no more gabriel had reached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a short time before he liked saying bathsheba as a private enjoyment instead of whistling turned over his taste to black hair though he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy isolated himself till the space he filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness marriage transforms a distraction into a support the power of which should be and happily often is in direct pro portion to the degree of imbecility it supplants oak began now to see light in this direction and said to himself i'll make her my wife or upon my soul i shall be good for nothing all this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage of bathsheba's aunt he found his opportunity in the death of a ewe mother of a living lamb on a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution a fine january morning when there was just enough blue sky visible to make cheerfully disposed people wish for more and an occasional gleam of silvery sunshine oak put the lamb into a respectable sunday basket and stalked across the fields to the house of mrs hurst the aunt george the dog walking behind with a countenance of great concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking gabriel had watched the blue wood smoke curling from the chimney with strange meditation at evening he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the spot of its origin seen the hearth and bathsheba beside it beside it in her out door dress for the clothes she had worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included in the compass of his affection they seemed at this early time of his love a necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called bath sheba everdene he had made a toilet of a nicely adjusted kind of a nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly ornate of a degree between fine market day and wet sunday selection he thoroughly cleaned his silver watch chain with whiting put new lacing straps to his boots looked to the brass eyelet holes went to the inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking stick and trimmed it vigorously on his way back took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes box put on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects of either and used all the hair oil he possessed upon his usually dry sandy and inextricably curly hair till he had deepened it to a splendidly novel colour between that of guano and roman cement making it stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg or wet seaweed round a boulder after the ebb nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves one might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of those under them it seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one for as the rather untoward commence ment of oak's overtures just as he arrived by the garden gate he saw a cat inside going into various arched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog george the dog took no notice for he had arrived at an age at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath in fact he never barked even at the sheep except to order when it was done with an absolutely neutral countenance as a sort of com mination service which though offensive had to be gone through once now and then to frighten the flock for their own good a voice came from behind some laurel bushes into which the cat had run poor dear did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it did he poor dear i beg your pardon said oak to the voice but george was walking on behind me with a temper as mild as milk almost before he had ceased speaking oak was seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient of his answer nobody appeared and he heard the person retreat among the bushes gabriel meditated and so deeply that he brought small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of reverie where the issue of an interview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better any initial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of failure oak went up to the door a little abashed his mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of opening bathsheba's aunt was indoors will you tell miss everdene that somebody would be glad to speak to her said mr oak calling one's self merely some body without giving a name is not to be taken as an example of the ill breeding of the rural world it springs from a refined modesty of which townspeople with their cards and announcements have no notion whatever bathsheba was out the voice had evidently been hers will you come in mr oak oh thank ee said gabriel following her to the fireplace i've brought a lamb for miss everdene i thought she might like one to rear girls do she might said mrs hurst musingly though she's only a visitor here if you will wait a minute bathsheba will be in yes i will wait said gabriel sitting down the lamb isn't really the business i came about mrs hurst in short i was going to ask her if she'd like to be married and were you indeed yes because if she would i should be very glad to marry her d'ye know if she's got any other young man hanging about her at all let me think said mrs hurst poking the fire superfluously yes bless you ever so many young men you see farmer oak she's so good looking and an excellent scholar besides she was going to be a governess once you know only she was too wild not that her young men ever come here but lord in the nature of women she must have a dozen that's unfortunate said farmer oak contemplating a crack in the stone floor with sorrow i'm only an every day sort of man and my only chance was in being the first comer well there's no use in my waiting for that was all i came about so i'll take myself off home along mrs hurst when gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the down he heard a hoi hoi uttered behind him in a piping note of more treble quality than that in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when shouted across a field he looked round and saw a girl racing after him waving a white handkerchief oak stood still and the runner drew nearer it was bathsheba everdene gabriel's colour deepened hers was already deep not as it appeared from emotion but from running farmer oak i she said pausing for want of breath pulling up in front of him with a slanted face and putting her hand to her side i have just called to see you said gabriel pending her further speech yes i know that she said panting like a robin her face red and moist from her exertions like a peony petal before the sun dries off the dew i didn't know you had come to ask to have me or i should have come in from the garden instantly i ran after you to say that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me gabriel expanded i'm sorry to have made you run so fast my dear he said with a grateful sense of favours to come wait a bit till you've found your breath it was quite a mistake aunt's telling you i had a young man already bathsheba went on i haven't a sweetheart at all and i never had one and i thought that as times go with women it was such a pity to send you away thinking that i had several really and truly i am glad to hear that said farmer oak smiling one of his long special smiles and blushing with gladness he held out his hand to take hers which when she had eased her side by pressing it there was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her loud beating heart directly he seized it she put it behind her so that it slipped through his fingers like an eel i have a nice snug little farm said gabriel with half a degree less assurance than when he had seized her hand yes you have a man has advanced me money to begin with but still it will soon be paid off and though i am only an every day sort of man i have got on a little since i was a boy gabriel uttered a little in a tone to show her that it was the complacent form of a great deal e continued when we be married i am quite sure i can work twice as hard as i do now he went forward and stretched out his arm again bathsheba had overtaken him at a point beside which stood a low stunted holly bush now laden with red berries seeing his advance take the form of an attitude threatening a possible enclosure if not compression of her person she edged off round the bush why farmer oak she said over the top looking at him with rounded eyes i never said i was going to marry you well that is a tale said oak with dismay to run after anybody like this and then say you don't want him what i meant to tell you was only this she said eagerly and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the position she had made for herself that nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart instead of my having a dozen as my aunt said i hate to be thought men's property in that way though possibly i shall be had some day why if i'd wanted you i shouldn't have run after you like this twould have been the forwardest thing but there was no harm in hurrying to correct a piece of false news that had been told you oh no no
x 1 waggon load of valuable merchandise had been smuggled ashore at noonday perhaps and directly beneath their unsuspicious noses nothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock and double lock and secure with tape and sealing wax all the avenues of the delinquent vessel instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution after the mischief had happened a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal the moment that there was no longer any remedy unless people are more than commonly disagreeable it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them the better part of my companion's character if it have a better part is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard and forms the type whereby i recognise the man as most of these old custom house officers had good traits and as my position in reference to them being paternal and protective was favourable to the growth of friendly sentiments i soon grew to like them all it was pleasant in the summer forenoons when the fervent heat that almost liquefied the rest of the human family merely communicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systems it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry a row of them all tipped against the wall as usual while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out and came bubbling with laughter from their lips externally the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children the intellect any more than a deep sense of humour has little to do with the matter it is with both a gleam that plays upon the surface and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and grey mouldering trunk in one case however it is real sunshine in the other it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood it would be sad injustice the reader must understand to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage in the first place my coadjutors were not invariably old there were men among them in their strength and prime of marked ability and energy and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them then moreover the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair but as respects the majority of my corps of veterans there will be no wrong done if i characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life they seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical wisdom which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting and most carefully to have stored their memory with the husks they spoke with far more interest and unction of their morning's breakfast or yesterday's to day's or tomorrow's dinner than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago and all the world's wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes the father of the custom house the patriarch not only of this little squad of officials but i am bold to say of the respectable body of tide waiters all over the united states was a certain permanent inspector he might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system dyed in the wool or rather born in the purple since his sire a revolutionary colonel and formerly collector of the port had created an office for him and appointed him to fill it at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember this inspector when i first knew him was a man of fourscore years or thereabouts and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter green that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime's search with his florid cheek his compact figure smartly arrayed in a bright buttoned blue coat his brisk and vigorous step and his hale and hearty aspect altogether he seemed not young indeed but a kind of new contrivance of mother nature in the shape of man whom age and infirmity had no business to touch his voice and laugh which perpetually re echoed through the custom house had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old man's utterance they came strutting out of his lungs like the crow of a cock or the blast of a clarion looking at him merely as an animal and there was very little else to look at he was a most satisfactory object from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system and his capacity at that extreme age to enjoy all or nearly all the delights which he had ever aimed at or conceived of the careless security of his life in the custom house on a regular income and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him the original and more potent causes however lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature the moderate proportion of intellect and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients these latter qualities indeed being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on all fours he possessed no power of thought no depth of feeling no troublesome sensibilities nothing in short but a few commonplace instincts which aided by the cheerful temper which grew inevitably out of his physical well being did duty very respectably and to general acceptance in lieu of a heart he had been the husband of three wives all long since dead the father of twenty children most of whom at every age of childhood or maturity had likewise returned to dust here one would suppose might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition through and through with a sable tinge not so with our old inspector one brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences the next moment he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant far readier than the collector's junior clerk who at nineteen years was much the elder and graver man of the two i used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with i think livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice he was in truth a rare phenomenon so perfect in one point of view so shallow so delusive so impalpable such an absolute nonentity in every other my conclusion was that he had no soul no heart no mind nothing as i have already said but instincts and yet withal so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together that there was no painful perception of deficiency but on my part an entire contentment with what i found in him it might be difficult and it was so to conceive how he should exist hereafter so earthly and sensuous did he seem but surely his existence here admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath had been not unkindly given with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age one point in which he had vastly the advantage over his four footed brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat his gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait and to hear him talk of roast meat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster as he possessed no higher attribute and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish poultry and butcher's meat and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table his reminiscences of good cheer however ancient the date of the actual banquet seemed to bring the savour of pig or turkey under one's very nostrils there were flavours on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years and were still apparently as fresh as that of the mutton chop which he had just devoured for his breakfast i have heard him smack his lips over dinners every guest at which except himself had long been food for worms it was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him not in anger or retribution but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to reduplicate an endless series of enjoyment at once shadowy and sensual a tenderloin of beef a hind quarter of veal a spare rib of pork a particular chicken or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder adams would be remembered while all the subsequent experience of our race and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze the chief tragic event of the old man's life so far as i could judge was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago a goose of most promising figure but which at table proved so inveterately tough that the carving knife would make no impression on its carcase and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw but it is time to quit this sketch on which however i should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because of all men whom i have ever known this individual was fittest to be a custom house officer most persons owing to causes which i may not have space to hint at suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life the old inspector was incapable of it and were he to continue in office to the end of time would be just as good as he was then and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite there is one likeness without which my gallery of custom house portraits would be strangely incomplete but which my comparatively few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest outline it is that of the collector our gallant old general who after his brilliant military service subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild western territory had come hither twenty years before to spend the decline of his varied and honourable life the brave soldier had already numbered nearly or quite his three score years and ten and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spirit stirring recollections could do little towards lightening the step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge it was only with the assistance of a servant and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade that he could slowly and painfully ascend the custom house steps and with a toilsome progress across the floor attain his customary chair beside the fireplace there he used to sit gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went amid the rustle of papers the administering of oaths the discussion of business and the casual talk of the office all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation his countenance in this repose was mild and kindly if his notice was sought an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features proving that there was light within him and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage the closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind the sounder it appeared when no longer called upon to speak or listen either of which operations cost him an evident effort his face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude it was not painful to behold this look for though dim it had not the imbecility of decaying age the framework of his nature originally strong and massive was not yet crumpled into ruin to observe and define his character however under such disadvantages was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew in imagination an old fortress like ticonderoga from a view of its grey and broken ruins here and there perchance the walls may remain almost complete but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound cumbrous with its very strength and overgrown through long years of peace and neglect with grass and alien weeds nevertheless looking at the old warrior with affection for slight as was the communication between us my feeling towards him like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him might not improperly be termed so i could discern the main points of his portrait it was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not a mere accident but of good right that he had won a distinguished name his spirit could never i conceive have been characterized by an uneasy activity it must at any period of his life have required an impulse to set him in motion but once stirred up with obstacles to overcome and an adequate object to be attained it was not in the man to give out or fail the heat that had formerly pervaded his nature and which was not yet extinct was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze but rather a deep red glow as of iron in a furnace weight solidity firmness this was the expression of his repose even in such decay as had crept untimely over him at the period of which i speak but i could imagine even then that under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness roused by a trumpet's peal loud enough to awaken all of his energies that were not dead but only slumbering he was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man's gown dropping the staff of age to seize a battle sword and starting up once more a warrior and in so intense a moment his demeanour would have still been calm such an exhibition however was but to be pictured in fancy not to be anticipated nor desired what i saw in him as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of old ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate simile was the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days of integrity that like most of his other endowments lay in a somewhat heavy mass and was just as unmalleable or unmanageable as a ton of iron ore and of benevolence which fiercely as he led the bayonets on at chippewa or fort erie i take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age he had slain men with his own hand for aught i know certainly they had fallen like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe before the charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energy but be that as it might there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterfly's wing i have not known the man to whose innate kindliness i would more confidently make an appeal many characteristics and those too which contribute not the least forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch must have vanished or been obscured before i met the general all merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent nor does nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay as she sows wall flowers over the ruined fortress of ticonderoga still even in respect of grace and beauty there were points well worth noting a ray of humour now and then would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces a trait of native elegance seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth was shown in the general's fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers an old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow but here was one who seemed to have a young girl's appreciation of the floral tribe there beside the fireplace the brave old general used to sit while the surveyor though seldom when it could be avoided taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation was fond of standing at a distance and watching his quiet and almost slumberous countenance he seemed away from us although we saw him but a few yards off remote though we passed close beside his chair unattainable though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own it might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts than amid the unappropriate environment of the collector's office the evolutions of the parade the tumult of the battle the flourish of old heroic music heard thirty years before such scenes and sounds perhaps were all alive before his intellectual sense meanwhile the merchants and ship masters the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors entered and departed the bustle of his commercial and custom house life kept up its little murmur round about him and neither with the men nor their affairs did the general appear to sustain the most distant relation he was as much out of place as an old sword now rusty but which had flashed once in the battle's front and showed still a bright gleam along its blade would have been among the inkstands paper folders and mahogany rulers on the deputy collector's desk there was one thing that much aided me in renewing and re creating the stalwart soldier of the niagara frontier the man of true and simple energy it was the recollection of those memorable words of his i'll try sir spoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise and breathing the soul and spirit of new england hardihood comprehending all perils and encountering all if in our country valour were rewarded by heraldic honour this phrase which it seems so easy to speak but which only he with such a task of danger and glory before him has ever spoken would be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the general's shield of arms it contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself who care little for his pursuits and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate the accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office there was one man especially the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent his gifts were emphatically those of a man of business prompt acute clear minded with an eye that saw through all perplexities and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish as by the waving of an enchanter's wand bred up from boyhood in the custom house it was his proper field of activity and the many intricacies of business so harassing to the interloper presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system in my contemplation he stood as the ideal of his class he was indeed the custom house in himself or at all events the mainspring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion for in an institution like this where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them thus by an inevitable necessity as a magnet attracts steel filings so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with with an easy condescension and kind forbearance towards our stupidity which to his order of mind must have seemed little short of crime would he forth with by the merest touch of his finger make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight the merchants valued him not less than we his esoteric friends his integrity was perfect it was a law of nature with him rather than a choice or a principle nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs a stain on his conscience as to anything that came within the range of his vocation would trouble such a man very much in the same way though to a far greater degree than an error in the balance of an account or an ink blot on the fair page of a book of record here in a word and it is a rare instance in my life i had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held such were some of the people with whom i now found myself connected i took it in good part at the hands of providence that i was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had after my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren of brook farm after living for three years within the subtle influence of an intellect like emerson's after those wild free days on the assabeth indulging fantastic speculations beside our fire of fallen boughs with ellery channing after talking with thoreau about pine trees and indian relics in his hermitage at walden after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of hillard's culture after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at longfellow's hearthstone it was time at length that i should exercise other faculties of my nature and nourish myself with food for which i had hitherto had little appetite even the old inspector was desirable as a change of diet to a man who had known alcott i looked upon it as an evidence in some measure of a system naturally well balanced and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization that with such associates to remember i could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities and never murmur at the change literature its exertions and objects were now of little moment in my regard i cared not at this period for books they were apart from me nature except it were human nature the nature that is developed in earth and sky was in one sense hidden from me and all the imaginative delight wherewith it had been spiritualized passed away out of my mind a gift a faculty if it had not been departed was suspended and inanimate within me there would have been something sad unutterably dreary in all this had i not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past it might be true indeed that this was a life which could not with impunity be lived too long else it might make me permanently other than i had been without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take but i never considered it as other than a transitory life there was always a prophetic instinct a low whisper in my ear that within no long period and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good change would come meanwhile there i was a surveyor of the revenue and so far as i have been able to understand as good a surveyor as need be a man of thought fancy and sensibility had he ten times the surveyor's proportion of those qualities may at any time be a man of affairs if he will only choose to give himself the trouble my fellow officers and the merchants and sea captains with whom my official duties brought me into any manner of connection viewed me in no other light and probably knew me in no other character none of them i presume had ever read a page of my inditing or would have cared a fig the more for me if they had read them all nor would it have mended the matter in the least had those same unprofitable pages been written with a pen like that of burns or of chaucer each of whom was a custom house officer in his day as well as i it is a good lesson though it may often be a hard one for a man who has dreamed of literary fame and of making for himself a rank among the world's dignitaries by such means to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized and to find how utterly devoid of significance beyond that circle is all that he achieves and all he aims at i know not that i especially needed the lesson either in the way of warning or rebuke but at any rate i learned it thoroughly nor it gives me pleasure to reflect did the truth as it came home to my perception ever cost me a pang or require to be thrown off in a sigh in the way of literary talk it is true the naval officer an excellent fellow who came into the office with me and went out only a little later would often engage me in a discussion about one or the other of his favourite topics napoleon or shakespeare the collector's junior clerk too a young gentleman who it was whispered occasionally covered a sheet of uncle sam's letter paper with what at the distance of a few yards looked very much like poetry used now and then to speak to me of books as matters with which i might possibly be conversant this was my all of lettered intercourse and it was quite sufficient for my necessities no longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blasoned abroad on title pages i smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue the custom house marker imprinted it with a stencil and black paint on pepper bags and baskets of anatto and cigar boxes and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost and gone regularly through the office borne on such queer vehicle of fame a knowledge of my existence so far as a name conveys it was carried where it had never been before and i hope will never go again but the past was not dead once in a great while the thoughts that had seemed so vital and so active yet had been put to rest so quietly revived again one of the most remarkable occasions when the habit of bygone days awoke in me was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which i am now writing in the second storey of the custom house there is a large room in which the brick work and naked rafters have never been covered with panelling and plaster the edifice originally projected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be realized contains far more space than its occupants know what to do with this airy hall therefore over the collector's apartments remains unfinished to this day and in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams appears still to await the labour of the carpenter and mason at one end of the room in a recess were a number of barrels piled one upon another containing bundles of official documents large quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor it was sorrowful to think how many days and weeks and months and years of toil had been wasted on these musty papers which were now only an encumbrance on earth and were hidden away in this forgotten corner never more to be glanced at by human eyes but then what reams of other manuscripts filled not with the dulness of official formalities but with the thought of inventive brains and the rich effusion of deep hearts had gone equally to oblivion and that moreover without serving a purpose in their day as these heaped up papers had and saddest of all without purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the clerks of the custom house had gained by these worthless scratchings of the pen yet not altogether worthless perhaps as materials of local history here no doubt statistics of the former commerce of salem might be discovered and memorials of her princely merchants old king derby old billy gray old simon forrester and many another magnate in his day whose powdered head however was scarcely in the tomb before his mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle the founders of the greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of salem might here be traced from the petty and obscure beginnings of their traffic at periods generally much posterior to the revolution upward to what their children look upon
x 1 were in shadow for the candles in the smoking room had not been lighted and only the face of the journalist and the legs of the silent man from the knees downward were illuminated at first we glanced now and again at each other after a time we ceased to do that and looked only at the time traveller's face iii i told some of you last thursday of the principles of the time machine and showed you the actual thing itself incomplete in the workshop there it is now a little travel worn truly and one of the ivory bars is cracked and a brass rail bent but the rest of it's sound enough i expected to finish it on friday but on friday when the putting together was nearly done i found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short and this i had to get remade so that the thing was not complete until this morning it was at ten o'clock to day that the first of all time machines began its career i gave it a last tap tried all the screws again put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddle i suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as i felt then i took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other pressed the first and almost immediately the second i seemed to reel i felt a nightmare sensation of falling and looking round i saw the laboratory exactly as before had anything happened for a moment i suspected that my intellect had tricked me then i noted the clock a moment before as it seemed it had stood at a minute or so past ten now it was nearly half past three i drew a breath set my teeth gripped the starting lever with both hands and went off with a thud the laboratory got hazy and went dark mrs watchett came in and walked apparently without seeing me towards the garden door i suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket i pressed the lever over to its extreme position the night came like the turning out of a lamp and in another moment came to morrow the laboratory grew faint and hazy then fainter and ever fainter to morrow night came black then day again night again day again faster and faster still an eddying murmur filled my ears and a strange dumb confusedness descended on my mind i am afraid i cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling they are excessively unpleasant there is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback of a helpless headlong motion i felt the same horrible anticipation too of an imminent smash as i put on pace night followed day like the flapping of a black wing the dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me and i saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky leaping it every minute and every minute marking a day i supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and i had come into the open air i had a dim impression of scaffolding but i was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things the slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me the twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye then in the intermittent darknesses i saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars presently as i went on still gaining velocity the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight the jerking sun became a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space the moon a fainter fluctuating band and i could see nothing of the stars save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue the landscape was misty and vague i was still on the hill side upon which this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim i saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour now brown now green they grew spread shivered and passed away i saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair and pass like dreams the whole surface of the earth seemed changed melting and flowing under my eyes the little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster presently i noted that the sun belt swayed up and down from solstice to solstice in a minute or less and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world and vanished and was followed by the bright brief green of spring the unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now they merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration i remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which i was unable to account but my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a kind of madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at first i scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but these new sensations but presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread until at last they took complete possession of me what strange developments of humanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilization i thought might not appear when i came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes i saw great and splendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildings of our own time and yet as it seemed built of glimmer and mist i saw a richer green flow up the hill side and remain there without any wintry intermission even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair and so my mind came round to the business of stopping the peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which i or the machine occupied so long as i travelled at a high velocity through time this scarcely mattered i was so to speak attenuated was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances but to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself molecule by molecule into whatever lay in my way meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction possibly a far reaching explosion would result and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions into the unknown this possibility had occurred to me again and again while i was making the machine but then i had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk one of the risks a man has got to take now the risk was inevitable i no longer saw it in the same cheerful light the fact is that insensibly the absolute strangeness of everything the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine above all the feeling of prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerve i told myself that i could never stop and with a gust of petulance i resolved to stop forthwith like an impatient fool i lugged over the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling over and i was flung headlong through the air there was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears i may have been stunned for a moment a pitiless hail was hissing round me and i was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone i looked round me i was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden surrounded by rhododendron bushes and i noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail stones the rebounding dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine and drove along the ground like smoke in a moment i was wet to the skin fine hospitality said i to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you presently i thought what a fool i was to get wet i stood up and looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently in some white stone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour but all else of the world was invisible my sensations would be hard to describe as the columns of hail grew thinner i saw the white figure more distinctly it was very large for a silver birch tree touched its shoulder it was of white marble in shape something like a winged sphinx but the wings instead of being carried vertically at the sides were spread so that it seemed to hover the pedestal it appeared to me was of bronze and was thick with verdigris it chanced that the face was towards me the sightless eyes seemed to watch me there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips it was greatly weather worn and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease i stood looking at it for a little space half a minute perhaps or half an hour it seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun i looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn what might not have happened to men what if cruelty had grown into a common passion what if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly powerful i might seem some old world savage animal only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness a foul creature to be incontinently slain already i saw other vast shapes huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns with a wooded hill side dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm i was seized with a panic fear i turned frantically to the time machine and strove hard to readjust it as i did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm the grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost above me in the intense blue of the summer sky some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct shining with the wet of the thunderstorm and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses i felt naked in a strange world i felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop my fear grew to frenzy i took a breathing space set my teeth and again grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine it gave under my desperate onset and turned over it struck my chin violently one hand on the saddle the other on the lever i stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again but with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered i looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future in a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer house i saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes they had seen me and their faces were directed towards me then i heard voices approaching me coming through the bushes by the white sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running one of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which i stood with my machine he was a slight creature perhaps four feet high clad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a leather belt sandals or buskins i could not clearly distinguish which were on his feet his legs were bare to the knees and his head was bare noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm the air was he struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature but indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much at the sight of him i suddenly regained confidence i took my hands from the machine iv in another moment we were standing face to face i and this fragile thing out of futurity he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue there were others coming and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me one of them addressed me it came into my head oddly enough that my voice was too harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and pointing to my ears shook it again he came a step forward hesitated and then touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders they wanted to make sure i was real there was nothing in this at all alarming indeed there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence a graceful gentleness a certain childlike ease and besides they looked so frail that i could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine pins but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine happily then when it was not too late i thought of a danger i had hitherto forgotten and reaching over the bars of the machine i unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion and put these in my pocket then i turned again to see what i could do in the way of communication and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some further peculiarities in their dresden china type of prettiness their hair which was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face and their ears were singularly minute the mouths were small with bright red rather thin lips and the little chins ran to a point the eyes were large and mild and this may seem egotism on my part i fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest i might have expected in them as they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other i began the conversation i pointed to the time machine and to myself then hesitating for a moment how to express time i pointed to the sun at once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder for a moment i was staggered though the import of his gesture was plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly were these creatures fools you may hardly understand how it took me you see i had always anticipated that the people of the year eight hundred and two thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge art everything then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five year old children asked me in fact if i had come from the sun in a thunderstorm it let loose the judgment i had suspended upon their clothes their frail light limbs and fragile features a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind for a moment i felt that i had built the time machine in vain i nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them they all withdrew a pace or so and bowed then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck the idea was received with melodious applause and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging them upon me until i was almost smothered with blossom you who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building and so i was led past the sphinx of white marble which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone as i went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistible merriment to my mind the building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossal dimensions i was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious my general impression of the world i saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers a long neglected and yet weedless garden i saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals they grew scattered as if wild among the variegated shrubs but as i say i did not examine them closely at this time the time machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons the arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally i did not observe the carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw suggestions of old phoenician decorations as i passed through and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather worn several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway and so we entered i dressed in dingy nineteenth century garments looking grotesque enough garlanded with flowers and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright soft colored robes and shining white limbs in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech the big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown the roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered light the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal not plates nor slabs blocks and it was so much worn as i judged by the going to and fro of past generations as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone raised perhaps a foot from the floor and upon these were heaps of fruits some i recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange but for the most part they were strange between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions upon these my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do likewise with a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into the round openings in the sides of the tables i was not loath to follow their example for i felt thirsty and hungry as i did so i surveyed the hall at my leisure and perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look the stained glass windows which displayed only a geometrical pattern were broken in many places and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust and it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured nevertheless the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque there were perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating all were clad in the same soft and yet strong silky material fruit by the by was all their diet these people of the remote future were strict vegetarians and while i was with them in spite of some carnal cravings i had to be frugivorous also indeed i found afterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed the ichthyosaurus into extinction but the fruits were very delightful one in particular that seemed to be in season all the time i was there a floury thing in a three sided husk was especially good and i made it my staple at first i was puzzled by all these strange fruits and by the strange flowers i saw but later i began to perceive their import however i am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now so soon as my appetite was a little checked i determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine clearly that was the next thing to do the fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon and holding one of these up i began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures i had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning at first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently a fair haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name they had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of amusement however i felt like a schoolmaster amidst children and persisted and presently i had a score of noun substantives at least at my command and then i got to demonstrative pronouns and even the verb to eat but it was slow work and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations so i determined rather of necessity to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found they were before long for i never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts and that was their lack of interest they would come to me with eager cries of astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy the dinner and my conversational beginnings ended i noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone it is odd too how speedily i came to disregard these little people i went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied i was continually meeting more of these men of the future who would follow me a little distance chatter and laugh about me and having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way leave me again to my own devices the calm of evening was upon the world as i emerged from the great hall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun at first things were very confusing everything was so entirely different from the world i had known even the flowers the big building i had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley but the thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present position i resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away from which i could get a wider view of this our planet in the year eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one a.d for that i should explain was the date the little dials of my machine recorded as i walked i was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which i found the world for ruinous it was a little way up the hill for instance was a great heap of granite bound together by masses of aluminium a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda like plants nettles possibly but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves and incapable of stinging it was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure to what end built i could not determine it was here that i was destined at a later date to have a very strange experience the first intimation of a still stranger discovery but of that i will speak in its proper place looking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which i rested for a while i realized that there were no small houses to be seen apparently the single house and possibly even the household had vanished here and there among the greenery were palace like buildings but the house and the cottage which form such characteristic features of our own english landscape had disappeared communism said i to myself and on the heels of that came another thought i looked at the half dozen little figures that were following me then in a flash i perceived that all had the same form of costume the same soft hairless visage and the same girlish rotundity of limb it may seem strange perhaps that i had not noticed this before but everything was so strange now i saw the fact plainly enough in costume and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other these people of the future were alike and the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents i judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious physically at least and i found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion seeing the ease and security in which these people were living i felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman the institution of the family and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force where population is balanced and abundant much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the state where violence comes but rarely and off spring are secure there is less necessity indeed there is no necessity for an efficient family and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their children's needs disappears we see some beginnings of this even in our own time and in this future age it was complete this i must remind you was my speculation at the time later i was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality while i was musing upon these things my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure like a well under a cupola i thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing and then resumed the thread of my speculations there were no large buildings towards the top of the hill and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous i was presently left alone for the first time with a strange sense of freedom and adventure i pushed on up to the crest there i found a seat of some yellow metal that i did not recognize corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss the arm rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins heads i sat down on it and i surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day it was as sweet and fair a view as i have ever seen the sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson below was the valley of the thames in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel i have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery some in ruins and some still occupied here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk there were no hedges no signs of proprietary rights no evidences of agriculture the whole earth had become a garden so watching i began to put my interpretation upon the things i had seen and as it shaped itself to me that evening my interpretation was something in this way afterwards i found i had got only a half truth or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth it seemed to me that i had happened upon humanity upon the wane the ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind for the first time i began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged and yet come to think it is a logical consequence enough strength is the outcome
x 1 possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men but in all essentials a man i know i did but looking i presently saw something stirring within the shadow greyish billowy movements one above another and then two luminous disks like eyes then something resembling a little grey snake about the thickness of a walking stick coiled up out of the writhing middle and wriggled in the air towards me and then another a sudden chill came over me there was a loud shriek from a woman behind i half turned keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still from which other tentacles were now projecting and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit i saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me i heard inarticulate exclamations on all sides there was a general movement backwards i saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off stent among them i looked again at the cylinder and ungovernable terror gripped me i stood petrified and staring a big greyish rounded bulk the size perhaps of a bear was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder as it bulged up and caught the light it glistened like wet leather two large dark coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly the mass that framed them the head of the thing was rounded and had one might say a face there was a mouth under the eyes the lipless brim of which quivered and panted and dropped saliva the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively a lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder another swayed in the air those who have never seen a living martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance the peculiar v shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip the absence of brow ridges the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip the incessant quivering of this mouth the gorgon groups of tentacles the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth above all the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes were at once vital intense inhuman crippled and monstrous there was something fungoid in the oily brown skin something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty even at this first encounter this first glimpse i was overcome with disgust and dread suddenly the monster vanished it had toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit with a thud like the fall of a great mass of leather i heard it give a peculiar thick cry and forthwith another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture i turned and running madly made for the first group of trees perhaps a hundred yards away but i ran slantingly and stumbling for i could not avert my face from these things there among some young pine trees and furze bushes i stopped panting and waited further developments the common round the sand pits was dotted with people standing like myself in a half fascinated terror staring at these creatures or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay and then with a renewed horror i saw a round black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit it was the head of the shopman who had fallen in but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun now he got his shoulder and knee up and again he seemed to slip back until only his head was visible suddenly he vanished and i could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him that my fears overruled everything was then quite invisible hidden by the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made anyone coming along the road from chobham or woking would have been amazed at the sight a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular circle in ditches behind bushes behind gates and hedges saying little to one another and that in short excited shouts and staring staring hard at a few heaps of sand the barrow of ginger beer stood a queer derelict black against the burning sky and in the sand pits was a row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground chapter five the heat ray after the glimpse i had had of the martians emerging from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet a kind of fascination paralysed my actions i remained standing knee deep in the heather staring at the mound that hid them i was a battleground of fear and curiosity i did not dare to go back towards the pit but i felt a passionate longing to peer into it i began walking therefore in a big curve seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand heaps that hid these new comers to our earth once a leash of thin black whips like the arms of an octopus flashed across the sunset and was immediately withdrawn and afterwards a thin rod rose up joint by joint bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion what could be going on there most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups one a little crowd towards woking the other a knot of people in the direction of chobham evidently they shared my mental conflict there were few near me one man i approached he was i perceived a neighbour of mine though i did not know his name and accosted but it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation what ugly _brutes_ he said good god what ugly brutes he repeated this over and over again did you see a man in the pit i said but he made no answer to that we became silent and stood watching for a time side by side deriving i fancy a certain comfort in one another's company then i shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of elevation and when i looked for him presently he was walking towards woking the sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened the crowd far away on the left towards woking seemed to grow and i heard now a faint murmur from it the little knot of people towards chobham dispersed there was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit it was this as much as anything that gave people courage and i suppose the new arrivals from woking also helped to restore confidence at any rate as the dusk came on a slow intermittent movement upon the sand pits began a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance stop watch and advance again spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns i too on my side began to move towards the pit then i saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels i saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples and then within thirty yards of the pit advancing from the direction of horsell i noted a little black knot of men the foremost of whom was waving a white flag this was the deputation there had been a hasty consultation and since the martians were evidently in spite of their repulsive forms intelligent creatures it had been resolved to show them by approaching them with signals that we too were intelligent flutter flutter went the flag first to the right then to the left it was too far for me to recognise anyone there but afterwards i learned that ogilvy stent and henderson were with others in this attempt at communication this little group had in its advance dragged inward so to speak the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people and a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet distances suddenly there was a flash of light and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs which drove up one after the other straight into the still air this smoke or flame perhaps would be the better word for it was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towards chertsey set with black pine trees seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose and to remain the darker after their dispersal at the same time a faint hissing sound became audible beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex arrested by these phenomena a little knot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground as the green smoke arose their faces flashed out pallid green and faded again as it vanished then slowly the hissing passed into a humming into a long loud droning noise slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it forthwith flashes of actual flame a bright glare leaping from one to another sprang from the scattered group of men it was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame it was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire then by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run i stood staring not as yet realising that this was death leaping from man to man in that little distant crowd all i felt was that it was something very strange an almost noiseless and blinding flash of light and a man fell headlong and lay still and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them pine trees burst into fire and every dry furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames and far away towards knaphill i saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set alight it was sweeping round swiftly and steadily this flaming death this invisible inevitable sword of heat i perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched and was too astounded and stupefied to stir i heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the martians and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from woking station opens out on the common forth with the hissing and humming ceased and the black dome like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit all this had happened with such swiftness that i had stood motionless dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light had that death swept through a full circle it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise but it passed and spared me and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar the undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness except where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early night it was dark and suddenly void of men overhead the stars were mustering and in the west the sky was still a pale bright almost greenish blue the tops of the pine trees and the roofs of horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow the martians and their appliances were altogether invisible save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and glowed still and the houses towards woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment the little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence and the stillness of the evening so it seemed to me had scarcely been broken it came to me that i was upon this dark common helpless unprotected and alone suddenly like a thing falling upon me from without came fear with an effort i turned and began a stumbling run through the heather the fear i felt was no rational fear but a panic terror not only of the martians but of the dusk and stillness all about me such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that i ran weeping silently as a child might do once i had turned i did not dare to look back i remember i felt an extraordinary persuasion that i was being played with that presently when i was upon the very verge of safety this mysterious death as swift as the passage of light would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down chapter six the heat ray in the chobham road it is still a matter of wonder how the martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non conductivity this intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light but no one has absolutely proved these details however it is done it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter heat and invisible instead of visible light whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch lead runs like water it softens iron cracks and melts glass and when it falls upon water incontinently that explodes into steam that night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit charred and distorted beyond recognition and all night long the common from horsell to maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze the news of the massacre probably reached chobham woking and ottershaw about the same time in woking the shops had closed when the tragedy happened and a number of people shop people and so forth attracted by the stories they had heard were walking over the horsell bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon the common you may imagine the young people brushed up after the labours of the day and making this novelty as they would make any novelty the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial flirtation you may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road in the gloaming as yet of course few people in woking even knew that the cylinder had opened though poor henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the post office with a special wire to an evening paper as these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open they found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning mirror over the sand pits and the newcomers were no doubt soon infected by the excitement of the occasion by half past eight when the deputation was destroyed there may have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place besides those who had left the road to approach the martians nearer there were three policemen too one of whom was mounted doing their best under instructions from stent to keep the people back and deter them from approaching the cylinder there was some booing from those more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion for noise and horse play stent and ogilvy anticipating some possibilities of a collision had telegraphed from horsell to the barracks as soon as the martians emerged for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange creatures from violence after that they returned to lead that ill fated advance the description of their death as it was seen by the crowd tallies very closely with my own impressions the three puffs of green smoke the deep humming note and the flashes of flame but that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the heat ray saved them had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher none could have lived to tell the tale they saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand as it were lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight then with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit the beam swung close over their heads lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road and splitting the bricks smashing the windows firing the window frames and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner in the sudden thud hiss and glare of the igniting trees the panic stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road and single leaves like puffs of flame hats and dresses caught fire then came a crying from the common there were shrieks and shouts and suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with his hands clasped over his head screaming they're coming a woman shrieked and incontinently everyone was turning and pushing at those behind in order to clear their way to woking again they must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd jammed and a desperate struggle occurred all that crowd did not escape three persons at least two women and a little boy were crushed and trampled there and left to die amid the terror and the darkness chapter seven how i reached home for my own part i remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather all about me gathered the invisible terrors of the martians that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life i came into the road between the crossroads and horsell and ran along this to the crossroads at last i could go no further i was exhausted with the violence of my emotion and of my flight and i staggered and fell by the wayside that was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks i fell and lay still i must have remained there some time i sat up strangely perplexed for a moment perhaps i could not clearly understand how i came there my terror had fallen from me like a garment my hat had gone and my collar had burst away from its fastener a few minutes before there had only been three real things before me the immensity of the night and space and nature my own feebleness and anguish and the near approach of death now it was as if something turned over and the point of view altered abruptly there was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other i was immediately the self of every day again a decent ordinary citizen the silent common the impulse of my flight the starting flames were as if they had been in a dream i asked myself had these latter things indeed happened i could not credit it i rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge my mind was blank wonder my muscles and nerves seemed drained of their strength i dare say i staggered drunkenly a head rose over the arch and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared beside him ran a little boy he passed me wishing me good night i was minded to speak to him but did not i answered his greeting with a meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge over the maybury arch a train a billowing tumult of white firelit smoke and a long caterpillar of lighted windows went flying south clatter clatter clap rap and it had gone a dim group of people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row of gables that was called oriental terrace it was all so real and so familiar and that behind me it was frantic fantastic such things i told myself could not be perhaps i am a man of exceptional moods i do not know how far my experience is common at times i suffer from the strangest sense of detachment from myself and the world about me i seem to watch it all from the outside from somewhere inconceivably remote out of time out of space out of the stress and tragedy of it all this feeling was very strong upon me that night here was another side to my dream but the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the swift death flying yonder not two miles away there was a noise of business from the gasworks and the electric lamps were all alight i stopped at the group of people what news from the common said i there were two men and a woman at the gate eh said one of the men turning what news from the common i said ain't yer just _been_ there asked the men people seem fair silly about the common said the woman over the gate what's it all abart haven't you heard of the men from mars said i the creatures from mars quite enough said the woman over the gate thenks and all three of them laughed i felt foolish and angry i tried and found i could not tell them what i had seen they laughed again at my broken sentences you'll hear more yet i said and went on to my home i startled my wife at the doorway so haggard was i i went into the dining room sat down drank some wine and so soon as i could collect myself sufficiently i told her the things i had seen the dinner which was a cold one had already been served and remained neglected on the table while i told my story there is one thing i said to allay the fears i had aroused they are the most sluggish things i ever saw crawl they may keep the pit and kill people who come near them but they cannot get out of it but the horror of them don't dear said my wife knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine poor ogilvy i said to think he may be lying dead there my wife at least did not find my experience incredible when i saw how deadly white her face was i ceased abruptly they may come here she said again and again i pressed her to take wine and tried to reassure her they can scarcely move i said i began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that ogilvy had told me of the impossibility of the martians establishing themselves on the earth in particular i laid stress on the gravitational difficulty on the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of mars a martian therefore would weigh three times more than on mars albeit his muscular strength would be the same his own body would be a cope of lead to him that indeed was the general opinion both _the times_ and the _daily telegraph_ for instance insisted on it the next morning and both overlooked just as i did two obvious modifying influences the atmosphere of the earth we now know contains far more oxygen or far less argon whichever way one likes to put it than does mars the invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies and in the second place we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the martian possessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch but i did not consider these points at the time and so my reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders with wine and food the confidence of my own table and the necessity of reassuring my wife i grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure they have done a foolish thing said i fingering my wineglass they are dangerous because no doubt they are mad with terror perhaps they expected to find no living things certainly no intelligent living things a shell in the pit said i if the worst comes to the worst will kill them all the intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive powers in a state of erethism i remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividness even now my dear wife's sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniture for in those days even philosophical writers had many little luxuries the crimson purple wine in my glass are photographically distinct at the end of it i sat tempering nuts with a cigarette regretting ogilvy's rashness and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the martians so some respectable dodo in the mauritius might have lorded it in his nest and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in want of animal food we will peck them to death tomorrow my dear i did not know it but that was the last civilised dinner i was to eat for very many strange and terrible days chapter eight friday night the most extraordinary thing to my mind of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that friday was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong if on friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the woking sand pits i doubt if you would have had one human being outside it unless it were some relation of stent or of the three or four cyclists or london people lying dead on the common whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the new comers many people had heard of the cylinder of course and talked about it in their leisure but it certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to germany would have done in london that night poor henderson's telegram describing the gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard and his evening paper after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no reply the man was killed decided not to print a special edition even within the five mile circle the great majority of people were inert i have already described the behaviour of the men and women to whom i spoke all over the district people were dining and supping working men were gardening after the labours of the day children were being put to bed young people were wandering through the lanes love making students sat over their books maybe there was a murmur in the village streets a novel and dominant topic in the public houses and here and there a messenger or even an eye witness of the later occurrences caused a whirl of excitement a shouting and a running to and fro but for the most part the daily routine of working eating drinking sleeping went on as it had done for countless years as though no planet mars existed in the sky even at woking station and horsell and chobham that was the case in woking junction until a late hour trains were stopping and going on others were shunting on the sidings passengers were alighting and waiting and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way a boy from the town trenching on smith's monopoly was selling papers with the afternoon's news the ringing impact of trucks the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction mingled with their shouts of men from mars excited men came into the station about nine o'clock with incredible tidings and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might have done people rattling londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows and saw only a rare flickering vanishing spark dance up from the direction of horsell a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening it was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible there were half a dozen villas burning on the woking border there were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages and the people there kept awake till dawn a curious crowd lingered restlessly people coming and going but the crowd remaining both on
x 1 sir replied the servant mr hyde has a key your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man poole resumed the other musingly yes sir he do indeed said poole we have all orders to obey him i do not think i ever met mr hyde asked utterson o dear no sir he never dines here replied the butler indeed we see very little of 22 him on this side of the house he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory well good night poole good night mr utterson and the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart poor harry jekyll he thought my mind misgives me he is in deep waters he was wild when he was young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of god there is no statute of limitations ay it must be that the ghost of some old sin the cancer of some concealed disgrace punishment coming pede claudo years after memory has forgotten and self love condoned the fault and the lawyer scared by the thought brooded a while on his own past groping in all the corners of memory lest by chance some jack in the box of an old iniquity should leap to light there his past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing yet avoided and then by a return on his former subject he conceived a spark of hope this master hyde if he were studied thought he must have secrets of his own black secrets by the look of him secrets compared to which poor jekyll's worst would be like sunshine things cannot continue as they are it turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a 23 thief to harry's bedside poor harry what a wakening and the danger of it for if this hyde suspects the existence of the will he may grow impatient to inherit ay i must put my shoulder to the wheel if jekyll will but let me he added if jekyll will only let me for once more he saw before his mind's eye as clear as a transparency the strange clauses of the will 24 dr jekyll was quite at ease a fortnight later by excellent good fortune the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies all intelligent reputable men and all judges of good wine and mr utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed this was no new arrangement but a thing that had befallen many scores of times where utterson was liked he was liked well hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer when the light hearted and the loose tongued had already their foot on the threshold they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company practising for solitude sobering their minds in the man's rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety to this rule dr jekyll was no exception and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire a large well made smooth faced man of fifty with something of a slyish cast perhaps but every mark of capacity and kindness you could see by his looks that he cherished for mr utterson a sincere and warm affection 25 i have been wanting to speak to you jekyll began the latter you know that will of yours a close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful but the doctor carried it off gaily my poor utterson said he you are unfortunate in such a client i never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will unless it were that hide bound pedant lanyon at what he called my scientific heresies oh i know he's a good fellow you needn't frown an excellent fellow and i always mean to see more of him but a hide bound pedant for all that an ignorant blatant pedant i was never more disappointed in any man than lanyon you know i never approved of it pursued utterson ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic my will yes certainly i know that said the doctor a trifle sharply you have told me so well i tell you so again continued the lawyer i have been learning something of young hyde the large handsome face of dr jekyll grew pale to the very lips and there came a blackness about his eyes i do not care to hear more said he this is a matter i thought we had agreed to drop what i heard was abominable said utterson it can make no change you do not under 26 stand my position returned the doctor with a certain incoherency of manner i am painfully situated utterson my position is a very strange a very strange one it is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking jekyll said utterson you know me i am a man to be trusted make a clean breast of this in confidence and i make no doubt i can get you out of it my good utterson said the doctor this is very good of you this is downright good of you and i cannot find words to thank you in i believe you fully i would trust you before any man alive ay before myself if i could make the choice but indeed it isn't what you fancy it is not so bad as that and just to put your good heart at rest i will tell you one thing the moment i choose i can be rid of mr hyde i give you my hand upon that and i thank you again and again and i will just add one little word utterson that i'm sure you'll take in good part this is a private matter and i beg of you to let it sleep utterson reflected a little looking in the fire i have no doubt you are perfectly right he said at last getting to his feet well but since we have touched upon this business and for the last time i hope continued the doctor there is one point i should like you to understand i have really a very great interest in poor hyde i know you have seen 27 him he told me so and i fear he was rude but i do sincerely take a great a very great interest in that young man and if i am taken away utterson i wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him i think you would if you knew all and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise i can't pretend that i shall ever like him said the lawyer i don't ask that pleaded jekyll laying his hand upon the other's arm i only ask for justice i only ask you to help him for my sake when i am no longer here utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh well said he i promise 28 the carew murder case nearly a year later in the month of october 18 london was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim the details were few and startling a maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river had gone up stairs to bed about eleven although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours the early part of the night was cloudless and the lane which the maid's window overlooked was brilliantly lit by the full moon it seems she was romantically given for she sat down upon her box which stood immediately under the window and fell into a dream of musing never she used to say with streaming tears when she narrated that experience never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world and as she so sat she became aware of an aged and beautiful gentleman with white hair drawing near along the lane and advancing to meet him another and very small gentleman to whom at first she 29 paid less attention when they had come within speech which was just under the maid's eyes the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness it did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance indeed from his pointing it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way but the moon shone on his face as he spoke and the girl was pleased to watch it it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old world kindness of disposition yet with something high too as of a well founded self content presently her eye wandered to the other and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain mr hyde who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike he had in his hand a heavy cane with which he was trifling but he answered never a word and seemed to listen with an ill contained impatience and then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger stamping with his foot brandishing the cane and carrying on as the maid described it like a madman the old gentleman took a step back with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt and at that mr hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth and next moment with ape like fury he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway at the horror of these sights and sounds the maid fainted 30 it was two o'clock when she came to herself and called for the police the murderer was gone long ago but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane incredibly mangled the stick with which the deed had been done although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter the other without doubt had been carried away by the murderer a purse and a gold watch were found upon the victim but no cards or papers except a sealed and stamped envelope which he had been probably carrying to the post and which bore the name and address of mr utterson this was brought to the lawyer the next morning before he was out of bed and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances than he shot out a solemn lip i shall say nothing till i have seen the body said he this may be very serious have the kindness to wait while i dress and with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station whither the body had been carried as soon as he came into the cell he nodded yes said he i recognise him i am sorry to say that this is sir danvers carew good god sir exclaimed the officer is it possible and the next moment his eye 31 lighted up with professional ambition this will make a deal of noise he said and perhaps you can help us to the man and he briefly narrated what the maid had seen and showed the broken stick mr utterson had already quailed at the name of hyde but when the stick was laid before him he could doubt no longer broken and battered as it was he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to henry jekyll is this mr hyde a person of small stature he inquired particularly small and particularly wicked looking is what the maid calls him said the officer mr utterson reflected and then raising his head if you will come with me in my cab he said i think i can take you to his house it was by this time about nine in the morning and the first fog of the season a great chocolate coloured pall lowered over heaven but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street mr utterson beheld a marvellous number of degrees and hues of twilight for here it would be dark like the back end of evening and there would be a glow of a rich lurid brown like the light of some strange conflagration and here for a moment the fog would be quite broken up and a haggard shaft 32 of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths the dismal quarter of soho seen under these changing glimpses with its muddy ways and slatternly passengers and its lamps which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful re invasion of darkness seemed in the lawyer's eyes like a district of some city in a nightmare the thoughts of his mind besides were of the gloomiest dye and when he glanced at the companion of his drive he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's officers which may at times assail the most honest as the cab drew up before the address indicated the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street a gin palace a low french eating house a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads many ragged children huddled in the doorways and many women of different nationalities passing out key in hand to have a morning glass and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part as brown as umber and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings this was the home of henry jekyll's favourite of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling an ivory faced and silvery haired old woman opened the door she had an evil face smoothed by hypocrisy but her manners were excellent yes she said this was mr hyde's but he was not at home he had been in that night very late 33 but had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothing strange in that his habits were very irregular and he was often absent for instance it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday very well then we wish to see his rooms said the lawyer and when the woman began to declare it was impossible i had better tell you who this person is he added this is inspector newcomen of scotland yard a flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face ah said she he is in trouble what has he done mr utterson and the inspector exchanged glances he don't seem a very popular character observed the latter and now my good woman just let me and this gentleman have a look about us in the whole extent of the house which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty mr hyde had only used a couple of rooms but these were furnished with luxury and good taste a closet was filled with wine the plate was of silver the napery elegant a good picture hung upon the walls a gift as utterson supposed from henry jekyll who was much of a connoisseur and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour at this moment however the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked clothes lay about the floor with their pockets inside out 34 lock fast drawers stood open and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes as though many papers had been burned from these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book which had resisted the action of the fire the other half of the stick was found behind the door and as this clinched his suspicions the officer declared himself delighted a visit to the bank where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's credit completed his gratification you may depend upon it sir he told mr utterson i have him in my hand he must have lost his head or he never would have left the stick or above all burned the cheque book why money's life to the man we have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank and get out the handbills this last however was not so easy of accomplishment for mr hyde had numbered few familiars even the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice his family could nowhere be traced he had never been photographed and the few who could describe him differed widely as common observers will only on one point were they agreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders 35 incident of the letter it was late in the afternoon when mr utterson found his way to dr jekyll's door where he was at once admitted by poole and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or the dissecting rooms the doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden it was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friend's quarters and he eyed the dingy windowless structure with curiosity and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent the tables laden with chemical apparatus the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola at the further end a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize 36 and through this mr utterson was at last received into the doctor's cabinet it was a large room fitted round with glass presses furnished among other things with a cheval glass and a business table and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron a fire burned in the grate a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly and there close up to the warmth sat dr jekyll looking deadly sick he did not rise to meet his visitor but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice and now said mr utterson as soon as poole had left them you have heard the news the doctor shuddered they were crying it in the square he said i heard them in my dining room one word said the lawyer carew was my client but so are you and i want to know what i am doing you have not been mad enough to hide this fellow utterson i swear to god cried the doctor i swear to god i will never set eyes on him again i bind my honour to you that i am done with him in this world it is all at an end and indeed he does not want my help you do not know him as i do he is safe he is quite safe mark my words he will never more be heard of the lawyer listened gloomily he did not like his friend's feverish manner you seem pretty 37 sure of him said he and for your sake i hope you may be right if it came to a trial your name might appear i am quite sure of him replied jekyll i have grounds for certainty that i cannot share with any one but there is one thing on which you may advise me i have i have received a letter and i am at a loss whether i should show it to the police i should like to leave it in your hands utterson you would judge wisely i am sure i have so great a trust in you you fear i suppose that it might lead to his detection asked the lawyer no said the other i cannot say that i care what becomes of hyde i am quite done with him i was thinking of my own character which this hateful business has rather exposed utterson ruminated a while he was surprised at his friend's selfishness and yet relieved by it well said he at last let me see the letter the letter was written in an odd upright hand and signed edward hyde and it signified briefly enough that the writer's benefactor dr jekyll whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities need labour under no alarm for his safety as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence the lawyer liked this letter well enough it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions 38 have you the envelope he asked i burned it replied jekyll before i thought what i was about but it bore no postmark the note was handed in shall i keep this and sleep upon it asked utterson i wish you to judge for me entirely was the reply i have lost confidence in myself well i shall consider returned the lawyer and now one word more it was hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance the doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness he shut his mouth tight and nodded i knew it said utterson he meant to murder you you have had a fine escape i have had what is far more to the purpose returned the doctor solemnly i have had a lesson o god utterson what a lesson i have had and he covered his face for a moment with his hands on his way out the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with poole by the by said he there was a letter handed in to day what was the messenger like but poole was positive nothing had come except by post and only circulars by that he added this news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door possibly indeed it had been 39 written in the cabinet and if that were so it must be differently judged and handled with the more caution the newsboys as he went were crying themselves hoarse along the footways special edition shocking murder of an m p that was the funeral oration of one friend and client and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal it was at least a ticklish decision that he had to make and self reliant as he was by habit he began to cherish a longing for advice it was not to be had directly but perhaps he thought it might be fished for presently after he sat on one side of his own hearth with mr guest his head clerk upon the other and midway between at a nicely calculated distance from the fire a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house the fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds the procession of the town's life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind but the room was gay with firelight in the bottle the acids were long ago resolved the imperial dye had softened with time as the colour grows richer in stained windows and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free 40 and to disperse the fogs of london insensibly the lawyer melted there was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than mr guest and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant guest had often been on business to the doctor's he knew poole he could scarce have failed to hear of mr hyde's familiarity about the house he might draw conclusions was it not as well then that he should see a letter which put that mystery to rights and above all since guest being a great student and critic of handwriting would consider the step natural and obliging the clerk besides was a man of counsel he would scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark and by that remark mr utterson might shape his future course this is a sad business about sir danvers he said yes sir indeed it has elicited a great deal of public feeling returned guest the man of course was mad i should like to hear your views on that replied utterson i have a document here in his handwriting it is between ourselves for i scarce know what to do about it it is an ugly business at the best but there it is quite in your way a murderer's autograph guest's eyes brightened and he sat down at once and studied it with passion no sir he said not mad but it is an odd hand 41 and by all accounts a very odd writer added the lawyer just then the servant entered with a note is that from dr jekyll sir inquired the clerk i thought i knew the writing anything private mr utterson only an invitation to dinner why do you want to see it one moment i thank you sir and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents thank you sir he said at last returning both it's a very interesting autograph there was a pause during which mr utterson struggled with himself why did you compare them guest he inquired suddenly well sir returned the clerk there's a rather singular resemblance the two hands are in many points identical only differently sloped rather quaint said utterson it is as you say rather quaint returned guest i wouldn't speak of this note you know said the master no sir said the clerk i understand but no sooner was mr utterson alone that night than he locked the note into his safe where it reposed from that time forward what he thought henry jekyll forge for a murderer and his blood ran cold in his veins 42 remarkable incident of dr lanyon time ran on thousands of pounds were offered in reward for the death of sir danvers was resented as a public injury but mr hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed much of his past was unearthed indeed and all disreputable tales came out of the man's cruelty at once so callous and violent of his vile life of his strange associates of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career but of his present whereabouts not a whisper from the time he had left the house in soho on the morning of the murder he was simply blotted out and gradually as time drew on mr utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm and to grow more at quiet with himself the death of sir danvers was to his way of thinking more than paid for by the disappearance of mr hyde now that that evil influence had been withdrawn a new life began for dr jekyll he came out of his seclusion renewed relations with his friends became once more their familiar guest 43 and entertainer and whilst he had always been known for charities he was now no less distinguished for religion he was busy he was much in the open air he did good his face seemed to open and brighten as if with an inward consciousness of service and for more than two months the doctor was at peace on the 8th of january utterson had dined at the doctor's with a small party lanyon had been there and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends on the 12th and again on the 14th the door was shut against the lawyer the doctor was confined to the house poole said and saw no one on the 15th he tried again and was again refused and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits the fifth night he had in guest to dine with him and the sixth he betook himself to dr lanyon's there at least he was not denied admittance but when he came in he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor's appearance he had his death warrant written legibly upon his face the rosy man had grown pale his flesh had fallen away he was visibly balder and
x 1 said poole we have all orders to obey him i do not think i ever met mr hyde asked utterson o dear no sir he never dines here replied the butler indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory well good night poole good night mr utterson and the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart poor harry jekyll he thought my mind misgives me he is in deep waters he was wild when he was young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of god there is no statute of limitations ay it must be that the ghost of some old sin the cancer of some concealed disgrace punishment coming pede claudo years after memory has forgotten and self love condoned the fault and the lawyer scared by the thought brooded awhile on his own past groping in all the corners of memory least by chance some jack in the box of an old iniquity should leap to light there his past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided and then by a return on his former subject he conceived a spark of hope this master hyde if he were studied thought he must have secrets of his own black secrets by the look of him secrets compared to which poor jekyll's worst would be like sunshine things cannot continue as they are it turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to harry's bedside poor harry what a wakening and the danger of it for if this hyde suspects the existence of the will he may grow impatient to inherit ay i must put my shoulders to the wheel if jekyll will but let me he added if jekyll will only let me for once more he saw before his mind's eye as clear as transparency the strange clauses of the will dr jekyll was quite at ease a fortnight later by excellent good fortune the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies all intelligent reputable men and all judges of good wine and mr utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed this was no new arrangement but a thing that had befallen many scores of times where utterson was liked he was liked well hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer when the light hearted and loose tongued had already their foot on the threshold they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company practising for solitude sobering their minds in the man's rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety to this rule dr jekyll was no exception and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire a large well made smooth faced man of fifty with something of a stylish cast perhaps but every mark of capacity and kindness you could see by his looks that he cherished for mr utterson a sincere and warm affection i have been wanting to speak to you jekyll began the latter you know that will of yours a close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful but the doctor carried it off gaily my poor utterson said he you are unfortunate in such a client i never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will unless it were that hide bound pedant lanyon at what he called my scientific heresies o i know he's a good fellow you needn't frown an excellent fellow and i always mean to see more of him but a hide bound pedant for all that an ignorant blatant pedant i was never more disappointed in any man than lanyon you know i never approved of it pursued utterson ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic my will yes certainly i know that said the doctor a trifle sharply you have told me so well i tell you so again continued the lawyer i have been learning something of young hyde the large handsome face of dr jekyll grew pale to the very lips and there came a blackness about his eyes i do not care to hear more said he this is a matter i thought we had agreed to drop what i heard was abominable said utterson it can make no change you do not understand my position returned the doctor with a certain incoherency of manner i am painfully situated utterson my position is a very strange a very strange one it is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking jekyll said utterson you know me i am a man to be trusted make a clean breast of this in confidence and i make no doubt i can get you out of it my good utterson said the doctor this is very good of you this is downright good of you and i cannot find words to thank you in i believe you fully i would trust you before any man alive ay before myself if i could make the choice but indeed it isn't what you fancy it is not as bad as that and just to put your good heart at rest i will tell you one thing the moment i choose i can be rid of mr hyde i give you my hand upon that and i thank you again and again and i will just add one little word utterson that i'm sure you'll take in good part this is a private matter and i beg of you to let it sleep utterson reflected a little looking in the fire i have no doubt you are perfectly right he said at last getting to his feet well but since we have touched upon this business and for the last time i hope continued the doctor there is one point i should like you to understand i have really a very great interest in poor hyde i know you have seen him he told me so and i fear he was rude but i do sincerely take a great a very great interest in that young man and if i am taken away utterson i wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him i think you would if you knew all and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise i can't pretend that i shall ever like him said the lawyer i don't ask that pleaded jekyll laying his hand upon the other's arm i only ask for justice i only ask you to help him for my sake when i am no longer here utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh well said he i promise the carew murder case nearly a year later in the month of october 18 london was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim the details were few and startling a maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river had gone upstairs to bed about eleven although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours the early part of the night was cloudless and the lane which the maid's window overlooked was brilliantly lit by the full moon it seems she was romantically given for she sat down upon her box which stood immediately under the window and fell into a dream of musing never she used to say with streaming tears when she narrated that experience never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world and as she so sat she became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair drawing near along the lane and advancing to meet him another and very small gentleman to whom at first she paid less attention when they had come within speech which was just under the maid's eyes the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness it did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance indeed from his pointing it some times appeared as if he were only inquiring his way but the moon shone on his face as he spoke and the girl was pleased to watch it it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old world kindness of disposition yet with something high too as of a well founded self content presently her eye wandered to the other and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain mr hyde who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike he had in his hand a heavy cane with which he was trifling but he answered never a word and seemed to listen with an ill contained impatience and then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger stamping with his foot brandishing the cane and carrying on as the maid described it like a madman the old gentleman took a step back with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt and at that mr hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth and next moment with ape like fury he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway at the horror of these sights and sounds the maid fainted it was two o'clock when she came to herself and called for the police the murderer was gone long ago but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane incredibly mangled the stick with which the deed had been done although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter the other without doubt had been carried away by the murderer a purse and gold watch were found upon the victim but no cards or papers except a sealed and stamped envelope which he had been probably carrying to the post and which bore the name and address of mr utterson this was brought to the lawyer the next morning before he was out of bed and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances than he shot out a solemn lip i shall say nothing till i have seen the body said he this may be very serious have the kindness to wait while i dress and with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station whither the body had been carried as soon as he came into the cell he nodded yes said he i recognise him i am sorry to say that this is sir danvers carew good god sir exclaimed the officer is it possible and the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition this will make a deal of noise he said and perhaps you can help us to the man and he briefly narrated what the maid had seen and showed the broken stick mr utterson had already quailed at the name of hyde but when the stick was laid before him he could doubt no longer broken and battered as it was he recognized it for one that he had himself presented many years before to henry jekyll is this mr hyde a person of small stature he inquired particularly small and particularly wicked looking is what the maid calls him said the officer mr utterson reflected and then raising his head if you will come with me in my cab he said i think i can take you to his house it was by this time about nine in the morning and the first fog of the season a great chocolate coloured pall lowered over heaven but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street mr utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight for here it would be dark like the back end of evening and there would be a glow of a rich lurid brown like the light of some strange conflagration and here for a moment the fog would be quite broken up and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths the dismal quarter of soho seen under these changing glimpses with its muddy ways and slatternly passengers and its lamps which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness seemed in the lawyer's eyes like a district of some city in a nightmare the thoughts of his mind besides were of the gloomiest dye and when he glanced at the companion of his drive he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's officers which may at times assail the most honest as the cab drew up before the address indicated the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street a gin palace a low french eating house a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads many ragged children huddled in the doorways and many women of many different nationalities passing out key in hand to have a morning glass and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part as brown as umber and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings this was the home of henry jekyll's favourite of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling an ivory faced and silvery haired old woman opened the door she had an evil face smoothed by hypocrisy but her manners were excellent yes she said this was mr hyde's but he was not at home he had been in that night very late but he had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothing strange in that his habits were very irregular and he was often absent for instance it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday very well then we wish to see his rooms said the lawyer and when the woman began to declare it was impossible i had better tell you who this person is he added this is inspector newcomen of scotland yard a flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face ah said she he is in trouble what has he done mr utterson and the inspector exchanged glances he don't seem a very popular character observed the latter and now my good woman just let me and this gentleman have a look about us in the whole extent of the house which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty mr hyde had only used a couple of rooms but these were furnished with luxury and good taste a closet was filled with wine the plate was of silver the napery elegant a good picture hung upon the walls a gift as utterson supposed from henry jekyll who was much of a connoisseur and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour at this moment however the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked clothes lay about the floor with their pockets inside out lock fast drawers stood open and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes as though many papers had been burned from these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book which had resisted the action of the fire the other half of the stick was found behind the door and as this clinched his suspicions the officer declared himself delighted a visit to the bank where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's credit completed his gratification you may depend upon it sir he told mr utterson i have him in my hand he must have lost his head or he never would have left the stick or above all burned the cheque book why money's life to the man we have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank and get out the handbills this last however was not so easy of accomplishment for mr hyde had numbered few familiars even the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice his family could nowhere be traced he had never been photographed and the few who could describe him differed widely as common observers will only on one point were they agreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders incident of the letter it was late in the afternoon when mr utterson found his way to dr jekyll's door where he was at once admitted by poole and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms the doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden it was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friend's quarters and he eyed the dingy windowless structure with curiosity and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent the tables laden with chemical apparatus the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola at the further end a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize and through this mr utterson was at last received into the doctor's cabinet it was a large room fitted round with glass presses furnished among other things with a cheval glass and a business table and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron the fire burned in the grate a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly and there close up to the warmth sat dr jekyll looking deathly sick he did not rise to meet his visitor but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice and now said mr utterson as soon as poole had left them you have heard the news the doctor shuddered they were crying it in the square he said i heard them in my dining room one word said the lawyer carew was my client but so are you and i want to know what i am doing you have not been mad enough to hide this fellow utterson i swear to god cried the doctor i swear to god i will never set eyes on him again i bind my honour to you that i am done with him in this world it is all at an end and indeed he does not want my help you do not know him as i do he is safe he is quite safe mark my words he will never more be heard of the lawyer listened gloomily he did not like his friend's feverish manner you seem pretty sure of him said he and for your sake i hope you may be right if it came to a trial your name might appear i am quite sure of him replied jekyll i have grounds for certainty that i cannot share with any one but there is one thing on which you may advise me i have i have received a letter and i am at a loss whether i should show it to the police i should like to leave it in your hands utterson you would judge wisely i am sure i have so great a trust in you you fear i suppose that it might lead to his detection asked the lawyer no said the other i cannot say that i care what becomes of hyde i am quite done with him i was thinking of my own character which this hateful business has rather exposed utterson ruminated awhile he was surprised at his friend's selfishness and yet relieved by it well said he at last let me see the letter the letter was written in an odd upright hand and signed edward hyde and it signified briefly enough that the writer's benefactor dr jekyll whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities need labour under no alarm for his safety as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence the lawyer liked this letter well enough it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions have you the envelope he asked i burned it replied jekyll before i thought what i was about but it bore no postmark the note was handed in shall i keep this and sleep upon it asked utterson i wish you to judge for me entirely was the reply i have lost confidence in myself well i shall consider returned the lawyer and now one word more it was hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance the doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness he shut his mouth tight and nodded i knew it said utterson he meant to murder you you had a fine escape i have had what is far more to the purpose returned the doctor solemnly i have had a lesson o god utterson what a lesson i have had and he covered his face for a moment with his hands on his way out the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with poole by the bye said he there was a letter handed in to day what was the messenger like but poole was positive nothing had come except by post and only circulars by that he added this news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door possibly indeed it had been written in the cabinet and if that were so it must be differently judged and handled with the more caution the newsboys as he went were crying themselves hoarse along the footways special edition shocking murder of an m.p that was the funeral oration of one friend and client and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal it was at least a ticklish decision that he had to make and self reliant as he was by habit he began to cherish a longing for advice it was not to be had directly but perhaps he thought it might be fished for presently after he sat on one side of his own hearth with mr guest his head clerk upon the other and midway between at a nicely calculated distance from the fire a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house the fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds the procession of the town's life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind but the room was gay with firelight in the bottle the acids were long ago resolved the imperial dye had softened with time as the colour grows richer in stained windows and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of london insensibly the lawyer melted there was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than mr guest and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant guest had often been on business to the doctor's he knew poole he could scarce have failed to hear of mr hyde's familiarity about the house he might draw conclusions was it not as well then that he should see a letter which put that mystery to right and above all since guest being a great student and critic of handwriting would consider the step natural and obliging the clerk besides was a man of counsel he could scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark and by that remark mr utterson might shape his future course this is a sad business about sir danvers he said yes sir indeed it has elicited a great deal of public feeling returned guest the man of course was mad i should like to hear your views on that replied utterson i have a document here in his handwriting it is between ourselves for i scarce know what to do about it it is an ugly business at the best but there it is quite in your way a murderer's autograph guest's eyes brightened and he sat down at once and studied it with passion no sir he said not mad but it is an odd hand and by all accounts a very odd writer added the lawyer just then the servant entered with a note is that from dr jekyll sir inquired the clerk i thought i knew the writing anything private mr utterson only an invitation to dinner why do

in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep seated terror of the mind it was unlikely that the doctor should fear death and yet that was what utterson was tempted to suspect yes he thought he is
x 1 quarrel about which should wear the tightest stockings but they exchanged reproaches in low tones for they were wholesomely afraid of mrs kronborg's rawhide whip she did not chastise her children often but she did it thoroughly only a somewhat stern system of discipline could have kept any degree of order and quiet in that overcrowded house mrs kronborg's children were all trained to dress themselves at the earliest possible age to make their own beds the boys as well as the girls to take care of their clothes to eat what was given them and to keep out of the way mrs kronborg would have made a good chess player she had a head for moves and positions anna the elder daughter was her mother's lieutenant all the children knew that they must obey anna who was an obstinate contender for proprieties and not always fair minded to see the young kronborgs headed for sunday school was like watching a military drill mrs kronborg let her children's minds alone she did not pry into their thoughts or nag them she respected them as individuals and outside of the house they had a great deal of liberty but their communal life was definitely ordered in the winter the children breakfasted in the kitchen gus and charley and anna first while the younger children were dressing gus was nineteen and was a clerk in a dry goods store charley eighteen months younger worked in a feed store they left the house by the kitchen door at seven o'clock and then anna helped her aunt tillie get the breakfast for the younger ones without the help of this sister in law tillie kronborg mrs kronborg's life would have been a hard one mrs kronborg often reminded anna that no hired help would ever have taken the same interest mr kronborg came of a poorer stock than his wife from a lowly ignorant family that had lived in a poor part of sweden his great grandfather had gone to norway to work as a farm laborer and had married a norwegian girl this strain of norwegian blood came out somewhere in each generation of the kronborgs the intemperance of one of peter kronborg's uncles and the religious mania of another had been alike charged to the norwegian grandmother both peter kronborg and his sister tillie were more like the norwegian root of the family than like the swedish and this same norwegian strain was strong in thea though in her it took a very different character tillie was a queer addle pated thing as flighty as a girl at thirty five and overweeningly fond of gay clothes which taste as mrs kronborg philosophically said did nobody any harm tillie was always cheerful and her tongue was still for scarcely a minute during the day she had been cruelly overworked on her father's minnesota farm when she was a young girl and she had never been so happy as she was now had never before as she said had such social advantages she thought her brother the most important man in moonstone she never missed a church service and much to the embarrassment of the children she always spoke a piece at the sunday school concerts she had a complete set of standard recitations which she conned on sundays this morning when thea and her two younger brothers sat down to breakfast tillie was remonstrating with gunner because he had not learned a recitation assigned to him for george washington day at school the unmemorized text lay heavily on gunner's conscience as he attacked his buckwheat cakes and sausage he knew that tillie was in the right and that when the day came he would be ashamed of himself i don't care he muttered stirring his coffee they oughtn't to make boys speak it's all right for girls they like to show off no showing off about it boys ought to like to speak up for their country and what was the use of your father buying you a new suit if you're not going to take part in anything that was for sunday school i'd rather wear my old one anyhow why didn't they give the piece to thea gunner grumbled tillie was turning buckwheat cakes at the griddle thea can play and sing she don't need to speak but you've got to know how to do something gunner that you have what are you going to do when you git big and want to git into society if you can't do nothing everybody'll say can you sing can you play can you speak then git right out of society an that's what they'll say to you mr gunner gunner and alex grinned at anna who was preparing her mother's breakfast they never made fun of tillie but they understood well enough that there were subjects upon which her ideas were rather foolish when tillie struck the shallows thea was usually prompt in turning the conversation will you and axel let me have your sled at recess she asked all the time asked gunner dubiously i'll work your examples for you to night if you do oh all right there'll be a lot of em i don't mind i can work em fast how about yours axel axel was a fat little boy of seven with pretty lazy blue eyes i don't care he murmured buttering his last buckwheat cake without ambition too much trouble to copy em down jenny smiley'll let me have hers the boys were to pull thea to school on their sled as the snow was deep the three set off together anna was now in the high school and she no longer went with the family party but walked to school with some of the older girls who were her friends and wore a hat not a hood like thea iv and it was summer beautiful summer those were the closing words of thea's favorite fairy tale and she thought of them as she ran out into the world one saturday morning in may her music book under her arm she was going to the kohlers to take her lesson but she was in no hurry it was in the summer that one really lived then all the little overcrowded houses were opened wide and the wind blew through them with sweet earthy smells of garden planting the town looked as if it had just been washed people were out painting their fences the cottonwood trees were a flicker with sticky yellow little leaves and the feathery tamarisks were in pink bud with the warm weather came freedom for everybody people were dug up as it were the very old people whom one had not seen all winter came out and sunned themselves in the yard the double windows were taken off the houses the tormenting flannels in which children had been encased all winter were put away in boxes and the youngsters felt a pleasure in the cool cotton things next their skin thea had to walk more than a mile to reach the kohlers house a very pleasant mile out of town toward the glittering sand hills yellow this morning with lines of deep violet where the clefts and valleys were she followed the sidewalk to the depot at the south end of the town then took the road east to the little group of adobe houses where the mexicans lived then dropped into a deep ravine a dry sand creek across which the railroad track ran on a trestle beyond that gulch on a little rise of ground that faced the open sandy plain was the kohlers house where professor wunsch lived fritz kohler was the town tailor one of the first settlers he had moved there built a little house and made a garden when moonstone was first marked down on the map he had three sons but they now worked on the railroad and were stationed in distant cities one of them had gone to work for the santa fe and lived in new mexico mrs kohler seldom crossed the ravine and went into the town except at christmas time when she had to buy presents and christmas cards to send to her old friends in freeport illinois as she did not go to church she did not possess such a thing as a hat year after year she wore the same red hood in winter and a black sunbonnet in summer she made her own dresses the skirts came barely to her shoe tops and were gathered as full as they could possibly be to the waistband she preferred men's shoes and usually wore the cast offs of one of her sons she had never learned much english and her plants and shrubs were her companions she lived for her men and her garden beside that sand gulch she had tried to reproduce a bit of her own village in the rhine valley she hid herself behind the growth she had fostered lived under the shade of what she had planted and watered and pruned in the blaze of the open plain she was stupid and blind like an owl shade shade that was what she was always planning and making behind the high tamarisk hedge her garden was a jungle of verdure in summer above the cherry trees and peach trees and golden plums stood the windmill with its tank on stilts which kept all this verdure alive outside the sage brush grew up to the very edge of the garden and the sand was always drifting up to the tamarisks every one in moonstone was astonished when the kohlers took the wandering music teacher to live with them in seventeen years old fritz had never had a crony except the harness maker and spanish johnny this wunsch came from god knew where followed spanish johnny into town when that wanderer came back from one of his tramps wunsch played in the dance orchestra tuned pianos and gave lessons when mrs kohler rescued him he was sleeping in a dirty unfurnished room over one of the saloons and he had only two shirts in the world once he was under her roof the old woman went at him as she did at her garden she sewed and washed and mended for him and made him so clean and respectable that he was able to get a large class of pupils and to rent a piano as soon as he had money ahead he sent to the narrow gauge lodging house in denver for a trunkful of music which had been held there for unpaid board with tears in his eyes the old man he was not over fifty but sadly battered told mrs kohler that he asked nothing better of god than to end his days with her and to be buried in the garden under her linden trees they were not american basswood but the european linden which has honey colored blooms in summer with a fragrance that surpasses all trees and flowers and drives young people wild with joy thea was reflecting as she walked along that had it not been for professor wunsch she might have lived on for years in moonstone without ever knowing the kohlers without ever seeing their garden or the inside of their house besides the cuckoo clock which was wonderful enough and which mrs kohler said she kept for company when she was lonesome the kohlers had in their house the most wonderful thing thea had ever seen but of that later professor wunsch went to the houses of his other pupils to give them their lessons but one morning he told mrs kronborg that thea had talent and that if she came to him he could teach her in his slippers and that would be better mrs kronborg was a strange woman that word talent which no one else in moonstone not even dr archie would have understood she comprehended perfectly to any other woman there it would have meant that a child must have her hair curled every day and must play in public mrs kronborg knew it meant that thea must practice four hours a day a child with talent must be kept at the piano just as a child with measles must be kept under the blankets mrs kronborg and her three sisters had all studied piano and all sang well but none of them had talent their father had played the oboe in an orchestra in sweden before he came to america to better his fortunes he had even known jenny lind a child with talent had to be kept at the piano so twice a week in summer and once a week in winter thea went over the gulch to the kohlers though the ladies aid society thought it was not proper for their preacher's daughter to go where there was so much drinking not that the kohler sons ever so much as looked at a glass of beer they were ashamed of their old folks and got out into the world as fast as possible had their clothes made by a denver tailor and their necks shaved up under their hair and forgot the past old fritz and wunsch however indulged in a friendly bottle pretty often the two men were like comrades perhaps the bond between them was the glass wherein lost hopes are found perhaps it was common memories of another country perhaps it was the grapevine in the garden knotty fibrous shrub full of homesickness and sentiment which the germans have carried around the world with them as thea approached the house she peeped between the pink sprays of the tamarisk hedge and saw the professor and mrs kohler in the garden spading and raking the garden looked like a relief map now and gave no indication of what it would be in august such a jungle pole beans and potatoes and corn and leeks and kale and red cabbage there would even be vegetables for which there is no american name mrs kohler was always getting by mail packages of seeds from freeport and from the old country then the flowers there were big sunflowers for the canary bird tiger lilies and phlox and zinnias and lady's slippers and portulaca and hollyhocks giant hollyhocks beside the fruit trees there was a great umbrella shaped catalpa and a balm of gilead two lindens and even a ginka a rigid pointed tree with leaves shaped like butterflies which shivered but never bent to the wind this morning thea saw to her delight that the two oleander trees one white and one red had been brought up from their winter quarters in the cellar there is hardly a german family in the most arid parts of utah new mexico arizona but has its oleander trees however loutish the american born sons of the family may be there was never one who refused to give his muscle to the back breaking task of getting those tubbed trees down into the cellar in the fall and up into the sunlight in the spring they may strive to avert the day but they grapple with the tub at last when thea entered the gate her professor leaned his spade against the white post that supported the turreted dove house and wiped his face with his shirt sleeve someway he never managed to have a handkerchief about him wunsch was short and stocky with something rough and bear like about his shoulders his face was a dark bricky red deeply creased rather than wrinkled and the skin was like loose leather over his neck band he wore a brass collar button but no collar his hair was cropped close iron gray bristles on a bullet like head his eyes were always suffused and bloodshot he had a coarse scornful mouth and irregular yellow teeth much worn at the edges his hands were square and red seldom clean but always alive impatient even sympathetic morgen he greeted his pupil in a businesslike way put on a black alpaca coat and conducted her at once to the piano in mrs kohler's sitting room he twirled the stool to the proper height pointed to it and sat down in a wooden chair beside thea the scale of b flat major he directed and then fell into an attitude of deep attention without a word his pupil set to work to mrs kohler in the garden came the cheerful sound of effort of vigorous striving unconsciously she wielded her rake more lightly occasionally she heard the teacher's voice scale of e minor weiter weiter immer i hear the thumb like a lame foot weiter weiter once schon the chords quick the pupil did not open her mouth until they began the second movement of the clementi sonata when she remonstrated in low tones about the way he had marked the fingering of a passage it makes no matter what you think replied her teacher coldly there is only one right way the thumb there ein zwei drei vier etc then for an hour there was no further interruption at the end of the lesson thea turned on her stool and leaned her arm on the keyboard they usually had a little talk after the lesson herr wunsch grinned how soon is it you are free from school then we make ahead faster eh first week in june then will you give me the invitation to the dance he shrugged his shoulders it makes no matter if you want him you play him out of lesson hours all right thea fumbled in her pocket and brought out a crumpled slip of paper what does this mean please i guess it's latin wunsch blinked at the line penciled on the paper wherefrom you get this he asked gruffly out of a book dr archie gave me to read it's all english but that did you ever see it before she asked watching his face yes a long time ago he muttered scowling ovidius he took a stub of lead pencil from his vest pocket steadied his hand by a visible effort and under the words lente currite lente currite noctis equi he wrote in a clear elegant gothic hand go slowly go slowly ye steeds of the night he put the pencil back in his pocket and continued to stare at the latin it recalled the poem which he had read as a student and thought very fine there were treasures of memory which no lodging house keeper could attach one carried things about in one's head long after one's linen could be smuggled out in a tuning bag he handed the paper back to thea there is the english quite elegant he said rising mrs kohler stuck her head in at the door and thea slid off the stool come in mrs kohler she called and show me the piece picture the old woman laughed pulled off her big gardening gloves and pushed thea to the lounge before the object of her delight the piece picture which hung on the wall and nearly covered one whole end of the room was the handiwork of fritz kohler he had learned his trade under an old fashioned tailor in magdeburg who required from each of his apprentices a thesis that is before they left his shop each apprentice had to copy in cloth some well known german painting stitching bits of colored stuff together on a linen background a kind of mosaic the pupil was allowed to select his subject and fritz kohler had chosen a popular painting of napoleon's retreat from moscow the gloomy emperor and his staff were represented as crossing a stone bridge and behind them was the blazing city the walls and fortresses done in gray cloth with orange tongues of flame darting about the domes and minarets napoleon rode his white horse murat in oriental dress a bay charger thea was never tired of examining this work of hearing how long it had taken fritz to make it how much it had been admired and what narrow escapes it had had from moths and fire silk mrs kohler explained would have been much easier to manage than woolen cloth in which it was often hard to get the right shades the reins of the horses the wheels of the spurs the brooding eyebrows of the emperor murat's fierce mustaches the great shakos of the guard were all worked out with the minutest fidelity thea's admiration for this picture had endeared her to mrs kohler it was now many years since she used to point out its wonders to her own little boys as mrs kohler did not go to church she never heard any singing except the songs that floated over from mexican town and thea often sang for her after the lesson was over this morning wunsch pointed to the piano on sunday when i go by the church i hear you sing something thea obediently sat down on the stool again and began come ye disconsolate wunsch listened thoughtfully his hands on his knees such a beautiful child's voice old mrs kohler's face relaxed in a smile of happiness she half closed her eyes a big fly was darting in and out of the window the sunlight made a golden pool on the rag carpet and bathed the faded cretonne pillows on the lounge under the piece picture earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal the song died away that is a good thing to remember wunsch shook himself you believe that looking quizzically at thea she became confused and pecked nervously at a black key with her middle finger i don't know i guess so she murmured her teacher rose abruptly remember for next time thirds you ought to get up earlier that night the air was so warm that fritz and herr wunsch had their after supper pipe in the grape arbor smoking in silence while the sound of fiddles and guitars came across the ravine from mexican town long after fritz and his old paulina had gone to bed wunsch sat motionless in the arbor looking up through the woolly vine leaves at the glittering machinery of heaven lente currite noctis equi that line awoke many memories he was thinking of youth of his own so long gone by and of his pupil's just beginning he would even have cherished hopes for her except that he had become superstitious he believed that whatever he hoped for was destined not to be that his affection brought ill fortune especially to the young that if he held anything in his thoughts he harmed it he had taught in music schools in st louis and kansas city where the shallowness and complacency of the young misses had maddened him he had encountered bad manners and bad faith had been the victim of sharpers of all kinds was dogged by bad luck he had played in orchestras that were never paid and wandering opera troupes which disbanded penniless and there was always the old enemy more relentless than the others it was long since he had wished anything or desired anything beyond the necessities of the body now that he was tempted to hope for another he felt alarmed and shook his head it was his pupil's power of application her rugged will that interested him he had lived for so long among people whose sole ambition was to get something for nothing that he had learned not to look for seriousness in anything now that he by chance encountered it it recalled standards ambitions a society long forgot what was it she reminded him of a yellow flower full of sunlight perhaps no a thin glass full of sweet smelling sparkling moselle wine he seemed to see such a glass before him in the arbor to watch the bubbles rising and breaking like the silent discharge of energy in the nerves and brain the rapid florescence in young blood wunsch felt ashamed and dragged his slippers along the path to the kitchen his eyes on the ground v the children in the primary grades were sometimes required to make relief maps of moonstone in sand had they used colored sands as the navajo medicine men do in their sand mosaics they could easily have indicated the social classifications of moonstone since these conformed to certain topographical boundaries and every child understood them perfectly the main business street ran of course through the center of the town to the west of this street lived all the people who were as tillie kronborg said in society sylvester street the third parallel with main street on the west was the longest in town and the best dwellings were built along it far out at the north end nearly a mile from the court house and its cottonwood grove was dr archie's house its big yard and garden surrounded by a white paling fence the methodist church was in the center of the town facing the court house square the kronborgs lived half a mile south of the church on the long street that stretched out like an arm to the depot settlement this was the first street west of main and was built up only on one side the preacher's house faced the backs of the brick and frame store buildings and a draw full of sunflowers and scraps of old iron the sidewalk which ran in front of the kronborgs house was the one continuous sidewalk to the depot and all the train men and roundhouse employees passed the front gate every time they came uptown thea and mrs kronborg had many friends among the railroad men who often paused to chat across the fence and of one of these we shall have more to say in the part of moonstone that lay east of main street toward the deep ravine which farther south wound by mexican town lived all the humbler citizens the people who voted but did not run for office the houses were little story and a half cottages with none of the fussy architectural efforts that marked those on sylvester street they nestled modestly behind their cottonwoods and virginia creeper their occupants had no social pretensions to keep up there were no half glass front doors with doorbells or formidable parlors behind closed shutters here the old women washed in the back yard and the men sat in the front doorway and smoked their pipes the people on sylvester street scarcely knew that this part of the town existed thea liked to take thor and her express wagon and explore these quiet shady streets where the people never tried to have lawns or to grow elms and pine trees but let the native timber have its way and spread in luxuriance she had many friends there old women who gave her a yellow rose or a spray of trumpet vine and appeased thor with a cooky or a doughnut they called thea that preacher's girl but the demonstrative was misplaced for when they spoke of mr kronborg they called him the methodist preacher dr archie was very proud of his yard and garden which he worked himself he was the only man in moonstone who was successful at growing rambler roses and his strawberries were famous one morning when thea was downtown on an errand the doctor stopped her took her hand and went over her with a quizzical eye as he nearly always did when they met you haven't been up to my place to get any strawberries yet thea they're at their best just now mrs archie doesn't know what to do with them all come up this afternoon just tell mrs archie i sent you bring a big basket and pick till you are tired when she got home thea told her mother that she didn't want to go because she didn't like mrs archie she is certainly one queer woman mrs kronborg assented but he's asked you so often i guess you'll have to go this time she won't bite you after dinner thea took a basket put thor in his baby buggy and set out for dr archie's house at the other end of town as soon as she came within sight of the house she slackened her pace she approached it very slowly stopping often to pick dandelions and sand peas for thor to crush up in his fist it was his wife's custom as soon as dr archie left the house in the morning to shut all the doors and windows to keep the dust out and to pull down the shades to keep the sun from fading the carpets she thought too that neighbors were less likely to drop in if the house was closed up she was one of those people who are stingy without motive or reason even when they can gain nothing by it she must have known that skimping the doctor in heat and food made him more extravagant than he would have been had she made him comfortable he never came home for lunch because she gave him such miserable scraps and shreds of food no matter how much milk he bought he could never get thick cream for his strawberries even when he watched his wife lift it from the milk in smooth ivory colored blankets she managed by some sleight of hand to dilute it before it got to the breakfast table the butcher's favorite joke was about the kind of meat he sold mrs archie she felt no interest in food herself and she hated to prepare it she liked nothing better than to have dr archie go to denver for a few days he often went chiefly because he was
x 1 do and e not satisfied see what you'll get that's all reluctantly sally obeyed is you xpecting special guests then to night mr jellyband asked jimmy pitkin in a loyal attempt to divert his host's attention from the circumstances connected with sally's exit from the room aye that i be replied jellyband friends of my lord tony hisself dukes and duchesses from over the water yonder whom the young lord and his friend sir andrew ffoulkes and other young noblemen have helped out of the clutches of them murderin devils but this was too much for mr hempseed's querulous philosophy lud he said what do they do that for i wonder i don't old not with interferin in other folks ways as the scriptures say maybe mr empseed interrupted jellyband with biting sarcasm as you're a personal friend of mr pitt and as you says along with mr fox let em murder says you pardon me mr jellyband feebly protested mr hempseed i dunno as i ever did but mr jellyband had at last succeeded in getting upon his favourite hobby horse and had no intention of dismounting in any hurry or maybe you've made friends with some of them french chaps oo they do say have come over here o purpose to make us englishmen agree with their murderin ways i dunno what you mean mr jellyband suggested mr hempseed all i know is all _i_ know is loudly asserted mine host that there was my friend peppercorn oo owns the blue faced boar an as true and loyal an englishman as you'd see in the land and now look at im e made friends with some o them frog eaters obnobbed with them just as if they was englishmen and not just a lot of immoral godforsaking furrin spies well and what happened peppercorn e now ups and talks of revolutions and liberty and down with the aristocrats just like mr empseed over ere pardon me mr jellyband again interposed mr hempseed feebly i dunno as i ever did mr jellyband had appealed to the company in general who were listening awe struck and open mouthed at the recital of mr peppercorn's defalcations at one table two customers gentlemen apparently by their clothes had pushed aside their half finished game of dominoes and had been listening for some time and evidently with much amusement at mr jellyband's international opinions one of them now with a quiet sarcastic smile still lurking round the corners of his mobile mouth turned towards the centre of the room where mr jellyband was standing you seem to think mine honest friend he said quietly that these frenchmen spies i think you called them are mighty clever fellows to have made mincemeat so to speak of your friend mr peppercorn's opinions how did they accomplish that now think you lud sir i suppose they talked im over those frenchies i've eard it said ave got the gift of gab and mr empseed ere will tell you ow it is that they just twist some people round their little finger like indeed and is that so mr hempseed inquired the stranger politely nay sir replied mr hempseed much irritated i dunno as i can give you the information you require faith then said the stranger let us hope my worthy host that these clever spies will not succeed in upsetting your extremely loyal opinions but this was too much for mr jellyband's pleasant equanimity he burst into an uproarious fit of laughter which was soon echoed by those who happened to be in his debt hahaha hohoho hehehe he laughed in every key did my worthy host and laughed until his sides ached and his eyes streamed at me hark at that did ye ear im say that they'd be upsettin my opinions eh lud love you sir but you do say some queer things well mr jellyband said mr hempseed sententiously you know what the scriptures say let im oo stands take eed lest e fall but then hark'ee mr empseed retorted jellyband still holding his sides with laughter the scriptures didn't know me why i wouldn't so much as drink a glass of ale with one o them murderin frenchmen and nothin d make me change my opinions why i've eard it said that them frog eaters can't even speak the king's english so of course if any of em tried to speak their god forsaken lingo to me why i should spot them directly see and forewarned is forearmed as the saying goes aye my honest friend assented the stranger cheerfully i see that you are much too sharp and a match for any twenty frenchmen and here's to your very good health my worthy host if you'll do me the honour to finish this bottle of mine with me i am sure you're very polite sir said mr jellyband wiping his eyes which were still streaming with the abundance of his laughter and i don't mind if i do the stranger poured out a couple of tankards full of wine and having offered one to mine host he took the other himself loyal englishmen as we all are he said whilst the same humorous smile played round the corners of his thin lips loyal as we are we must admit that this at least is one good thing which comes to us from france aye we'll none of us deny that sir assented mine host and here's to the best landlord in england our worthy host mr jellyband said the stranger in a loud tone of voice hi hip hurrah retorted the whole company present then there was a loud clapping of hands and mugs and tankards made a rattling music upon the tables to the accompaniment of loud laughter at nothing in particular and of mr jellyband's muttered exclamations just fancy me bein talked over by any god forsaken furriner what lud love you sir but you do say some queer things to which obvious fact the stranger heartily assented it was certainly a preposterous suggestion that anyone could ever upset mr jellyband's firmly rooted opinions anent the utter worthlessness of the inhabitants of the whole continent of europe chapter iii the refugees feeling in every part of england certainly ran very high at this time against the french and their doings smugglers and legitimate traders between the french and the english coasts brought snatches of news from over the water which made every honest englishman's blood boil and made him long to have a good go at those murderers who had imprisoned their king and all his family subjected the queen and the royal children to every species of indignity and were even now loudly demanding the blood of the whole bourbon family and of every one of its adherents the execution of the princesse de lamballe marie antoinette's young and charming friend had filled every one in england with unspeakable horror the daily execution of scores of royalists of good family whose only sin was their aristocratic name seemed to cry for vengeance to the whole of civilised europe yet with all that no one dared to interfere burke had exhausted all his eloquence in trying to induce the british government to fight the revolutionary government of france but mr pitt with characteristic prudence did not feel that this country was fit yet to embark on another arduous and costly war it was for austria to take the initiative austria whose fairest daughter was even now a dethroned queen imprisoned and insulted by a howling mob surely twas not so argued mr fox for the whole of england to take up arms because one set of frenchmen chose to murder another as for mr jellyband and his fellow john bulls though they looked upon all foreigners with withering contempt they were royalist and anti revolutionists to a man and at this present moment were furious with pitt for his caution and moderation although they naturally understood nothing of the diplomatic reasons which guided that great man's policy by now sally came running back very excited and very eager the joyous company in the coffee room had heard nothing of the noise outside but she had spied a dripping horse and rider who had stopped at the door of the fisherman's rest and while the stable boy ran forward to take charge of the horse pretty miss sally went to the front door to greet the welcome visitor i think i see'd my lord antony's horse out in the yard father she said as she ran across the coffee room but already the door had been thrown open from outside and the next moment an arm covered in drab cloth and dripping with the heavy rain was round pretty sally's waist while a hearty voice echoed along the polished rafters of the coffee room aye and bless your brown eyes for being so sharp my pretty sally said the man who had just entered whilst worthy mr jellyband came bustling forward eager alert and fussy as became the advent of one of the most favoured guests of his hostel lud i protest sally added lord antony as he deposited a kiss on miss sally's blooming cheeks but you are growing prettier and prettier every time i see you and my honest friend jellyband here have hard work to keep the fellows off that slim waist of yours what say you mr waite mr waite torn between his respect for my lord and his dislike of that particular type of joke only replied with a doubtful grunt lord antony dewhurst one of the sons of the duke of exeter was in those days a very perfect type of a young english gentlemen tall well set up broad of shoulders and merry of face his laughter rang loudly wherever he went a good sportsman a lively companion a courteous well bred man of the world with not too much brains to spoil his temper he was a universal favourite in london drawing rooms or in the coffee rooms of village inns at the fisherman's rest everyone knew him for he was fond of a trip across to france and always spent a night under worthy mr jellyband's roof on his way there or back he nodded to waite pitkin and the others as he at last released sally's waist and crossed over to the hearth to warm and dry himself as he did so he cast a quick somewhat suspicious glance at the two strangers who had quietly resumed their game of dominoes and for a moment a look of deep earnestness even of anxiety clouded his jovial young face but only for a moment the next he turned to mr hempseed who was respectfully touching his forelock well mr hempseed and how is the fruit badly my lord badly replied mr hempseed dolefully but what can you xpect with this ere government favourin them rascals over in france who would murder their king and all their nobility odd's life retorted lord antony so they would honest hempseed at least those they can get hold of worse luck but we have got some friends coming here to night who at any rate have evaded their clutches it almost seemed when the young man said these words as if he threw a defiant look towards the quiet strangers in the corner thanks to you my lord and to your friends so i've heard it said said mr jellyband but in a moment lord antony's hand fell warningly on mine host's arm hush he said peremptorily and instinctively once again looked towards the strangers oh lud love you they are all right my lord retorted jellyband don't you be afraid i wouldn't have spoken only i knew we were among friends that gentleman over there is as true and loyal a subject of king george as you are yourself my lord saving your presence he is but lately arrived in dover and is setting down in business in these parts in business faith then it must be as an undertaker for i vow i never beheld a more rueful countenance nay my lord i believe that the gentleman is a widower which no doubt would account for the melancholy of his bearing but he is a friend nevertheless i'll vouch for that and you will own my lord that who should judge of a face better than the landlord of a popular inn oh that's all right then if we are among friends said lord antony who evidently did not care to discuss the subject with his host but tell me you have no one else staying here have you no one my lord and no one coming either leastways leastways no one your lordship would object to i know who is it well my lord sir percy blakeney and his lady will be here presently but they ain't a goin to stay lady blakeney queried lord antony in some astonishment aye my lord sir percy's skipper was here just now he says that my lady's brother is crossing over to france to day in the day dream which is sir percy's yacht and sir percy and my lady will come with him as far as here to see the last of him it don't put you out do it my lord no no it doesn't put me out friend nothing will put me out unless that supper is not the very best which miss sally can cook and which has ever been served in the fisherman's rest you need have no fear of that my lord said sally who all this while had been busy setting the table for supper and very gay and inviting it looked with a large bunch of brilliantly coloured dahlias in the centre and the bright pewter goblets and blue china about how many shall i lay for my lord five places pretty sally but let the supper be enough for ten at least our friends will be tired and i hope hungry as for me i vow i could demolish a baron of beef to night here they are i do believe said sally excitedly as a distant clatter of horses and wheels could now be distinctly heard drawing rapidly nearer there was a general commotion in the coffee room everyone was curious to see my lord antony's swell friends from over the water miss sally cast one or two quick glances at the little bit of mirror which hung on the wall and worthy mr jellyband bustled out in order to give the first welcome himself to his distinguished guests only the two strangers in the corner did not participate in the general excitement they were calmly finishing their game of dominoes and did not even look once towards the door straight ahead comtesse the door on your right said a pleasant voice outside aye there they are all right enough said lord antony joyfully off with you my pretty sally and see how quick you can dish up the soup the door was thrown wide open and preceded by mr jellyband who was profuse in his bows and welcomes a party of four two ladies and two gentlemen entered the coffee room welcome welcome to old england said lord antony effusively as he came eagerly forward with both hands outstretched towards the newcomers ah you are lord antony dewhurst i think said one of the ladies speaking with a strong foreign accent at your service madame he replied as he ceremoniously kissed the hands of both the ladies then turned to the men and shook them both warmly by the hand sally was already helping the ladies to take off their travelling cloaks and both turned with a shiver towards the brightly blazing hearth there was a general movement among the company in the coffee room sally had bustled off to her kitchen whilst jellyband still profuse with his respectful salutations arranged one or two chairs around the fire mr hempseed touching his forelock was quietly vacating the seat in the hearth everyone was staring curiously yet deferentially at the foreigners ah messieurs what can i say said the elder of the two ladies as she stretched a pair of fine aristocratic hands to the warmth of the blaze and looked with unspeakable gratitude first at lord antony then at one of the young men who had accompanied her party and who was busy divesting himself of his heavy caped coat only that you are glad to be in england comtesse replied lord antony and that you have not suffered too much from your trying voyage indeed indeed we are glad to be in england she said while her eyes filled with tears and we have already forgotten all that we have suffered her voice was musical and low and there was a great deal of calm dignity and of many sufferings nobly endured marked in the handsome aristocratic face with its wealth of snowy white hair dressed high above the forehead after the fashion of the times i hope my friend sir andrew ffoulkes proved an entertaining travelling companion madame ah indeed sir andrew was kindness itself how could my children and i ever show enough gratitude to you all messieurs her companion a dainty girlish figure childlike and pathetic in its look of fatigue and of sorrow had said nothing as yet but her eyes large brown and full of tears looked up from the fire and sought those of sir andrew ffoulkes who had drawn near to the hearth and to her then as they met his which were fixed with unconcealed admiration upon the sweet face before him a thought of warmer colour rushed up to her pale cheeks so this is england she said as she looked round with childlike curiosity at the great hearth the oak rafters and the yokels with their elaborate smocks and jovial rubicund british countenances a bit of it mademoiselle replied sir andrew smiling but all of it at your service the young girl blushed again but this time a bright smile fleet and sweet illumined her dainty face she said nothing and sir andrew too was silent yet those two young people understood one another as young people have a way of doing all the world over and have done since the world began but i say supper here broke in lord antony's jovial voice supper honest jellyband where is that pretty wench of yours and the dish of soup zooks man while you stand there gaping at the ladies they will faint with hunger one moment one moment my lord said jellyband as he threw open the door that led to the kitchen and shouted lustily sally hey sally there are ye ready my girl sally was ready and the next moment she appeared in the doorway carrying a gigantic tureen from which rose a cloud of steam and an abundance of savoury odour odd's life supper at last ejaculated lord antony merrily as he gallantly offered his arm to the comtesse may i have the honour he added ceremoniously as he led her towards the supper table there was a general bustle in the coffee room mr hempseed and most of the yokels and fisher folk had gone to make way for the quality and to finish smoking their pipes elsewhere only the two strangers stayed on quietly and unconcernedly playing their game of dominoes and sipping their wine whilst at another table harry waite who was fast losing his temper watched pretty sally bustling round the table she looked a very dainty picture of english rural life and no wonder that the susceptible young frenchman could scarce take his eyes off her pretty face the vicomte de tournay was scarce nineteen a beardless boy on whom terrible tragedies which were being enacted in his own country had made but little impression he was elegantly and even foppishly dressed and once safely landed in england he was evidently ready to forget the horrors of the revolution in the delights of english life pardi if zis is england he said as he continued to ogle sally with marked satisfaction i am of it satisfied it would be impossible at this point to record the exact exclamation which escaped through mr harry waite's clenched teeth only respect for the quality and notably for my lord antony kept his marked disapproval of the young foreigner in check nay but this is england you abandoned young reprobate interposed lord antony with a laugh and do not i pray bring your loose foreign ways into this most moral country lord antony had already sat down at the head of the table with the comtesse on his right jellyband was bustling round filling glasses and putting chairs straight sally waited ready to hand round the soup mr harry waite's friends had at last succeeded in taking him out of the room for his temper was growing more and more violent under the vicomte's obvious admiration for sally suzanne came in stern commanding accents from the rigid comtesse suzanne blushed again she had lost count of time and of place whilst she had stood beside the fire allowing the handsome young englishman's eyes to dwell upon her sweet face and his hand as if unconsciously to rest upon hers her mother's voice brought her back to reality once more and with a submissive yes mama she took her place at the supper table chapter iv the league of the scarlet pimpernel they all looked a merry even a happy party as they sat round the table sir andrew ffoulkes and lord antony dewhurst two typical good looking well born and well bred englishmen of that year of grace 1792 and the aristocratic french comtesse with her two children who had just escaped from such dire perils and found a safe retreat at last on the shores of protecting england in the corner the two strangers had apparently finished their game one of them arose and standing with his back to the merry company at the table he adjusted with much deliberation his large triple caped coat as he did so he gave one quick glance all around him everyone was busy laughing and chatting and he murmured the words all safe his companion then with the alertness borne of long practice slipped on to his knees in a moment and the next had crept noiselessly under the oak bench the stranger then with a loud good night quietly walked out of the coffee room not one of those at the supper table had noticed this curious and silent manoeuvre but when the stranger finally closed the door of the coffee room behind him they all instinctively sighed a sigh of relief alone at last said lord antony jovially then the young vicomte de tournay rose glass in hand and with the graceful affection peculiar to the times he raised it aloft and said in broken english to his majesty george three of england god bless him for his hospitality to us all poor exiles from france his majesty the king echoed lord antony and sir andrew as they drank loyally to the toast to his majesty king louis of france added sir andrew with solemnity may god protect him and give him victory over his enemies everyone rose and drank this toast in silence the fate of the unfortunate king of france then a prisoner of his own people seemed to cast a gloom even over mr jellyband's pleasant countenance and to m le comte de tournay de basserive said lord antony merrily may we welcome him in england before many days are over ah monsieur said the comtesse as with a slightly trembling hand she conveyed her glass to her lips i scarcely dare to hope but already lord antony had served out the soup and for the next few moments all conversation ceased while jellyband and sally handed round the plates and everyone began to eat faith madame said lord antony after a while mine was no idle toast seeing yourself mademoiselle suzanne and my friend the vicomte safely in england now surely you must feel reasurred as to the fate of monsieur le comte ah monsieur replied the comtesse with a heavy sigh i trust in god i can but pray and hope aye madame here interposed sir andrew ffoulkes trust in god by all means but believe also a little in your english friends who have sworn to bring the count safely across the channel even as they have brought you to day indeed indeed monsieur she replied i have the fullest confidence in you and your friends your fame i assure you has spread throughout the whole of france the way some of my own friends have escaped from the clutches of that awful revolutionary tribunal was nothing short of a miracle and all done by you and your friends we were but the hands madame la comtesse but my husband monsieur said the comtesse whilst unshed tears seemed to veil her voice he is in such deadly peril i would never have left him only there were my children i was torn between my duty to him and to them they refused to go without me and you and your friends assured me so solemnly that my husband would be safe but oh now that i am here amongst you all in this beautiful free england i think of him flying for his life hunted like a poor beast in such peril ah i should not have left him i should not have left him the poor woman had completely broken down fatigue sorrow and emotion had overmastered her rigid aristocratic bearing she was crying gently to herself whilst suzanne ran up to her and tried to kiss away her tears lord antony and sir andrew had said nothing to interrupt the comtesse whilst she was speaking there was no doubt that they felt deeply for her their very silence testified to that but in every century and ever since england has been what it is an englishman has always felt somewhat ashamed of his own emotion and of his own sympathy and so the two young men said nothing and busied themselves in trying to hide their feelings only succeeding in looking immeasurably sheepish as for me monsieur said suzanne suddenly as she looked through a wealth of brown curls across at sir andrew i trust you absolutely and i know that you will bring my dear father safely to england just as you brought us to day this was said with so much confidence such unuttered hope and belief that it seemed as if by magic to dry the mother's eyes and to bring a smile upon everybody's lips nay you shame me mademoiselle replied sir andrew though my life is at your service i have been but a humble tool in the hands of our great leader who organised and effected your escape he had spoken with so much warmth and vehemence that suzanne's eyes fastened upon him in undisguised wonder your leader monsieur said the comtesse eagerly ah of course you must have a leader and i did not think of that before but tell me where is he i must go to him at once and i and my children must throw ourselves at his feet and thank him for all that he has done for us alas madame said lord antony that is impossible impossible why because the scarlet pimpernel works in the dark and his identity is only known under the solemn oath of secrecy to his immediate followers the scarlet pimpernel said suzanne with a merry laugh why what a droll name what is the scarlet pimpernel monsieur she looked at sir andrew with eager curiosity the young man's face had become almost transfigured his eyes shone with enthusiasm hero worship love admiration for his leader seemed literally to glow upon his face the scarlet pimpernel mademoiselle he said at last is the name of a humble english wayside flower but it is also the name chosen to hide the identity of the best and bravest man in all the world so that he may better succeed in accomplishing the noble task he has set himself to do ah yes here interposed the young vicomte i have heard speak of this scarlet pimpernel a little flower red yes they say in paris that every time a royalist escapes to england that devil foucquier tinville the public prosecutor receives a paper with that little flower designated in red upon it yes yes that is so assented lord antony then he will have received one such paper to day undoubtedly oh i wonder what he will say said suzanne merrily i have heard that the picture of that little red flower is the only thing that frightens him faith then said sir andrew he will have many more opportunities of studying the shape of that small scarlet flower ah monsieur sighed the comtesse it all sounds like a romance and i cannot understand it all why should you try madame but tell me why should your leader why should you all spend your money and risk your lives for it is your lives you risk messieurs when you set foot in france and all for us french men and women who are nothing to you sport madame la comtesse sport asserted lord antony with his jovial loud and pleasant voice we are a nation of sportsmen you know and just now it is the fashion to pull the hare from between the teeth of the hound ah no no not sport only monsieur you have a more noble motive i am sure for the good work you
x 1 lay my own body as it had been lying all these hours with the eyes staring toward the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground i looked first at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and then down at myself in utter bewilderment for there i lay clothed and yet here i stood but naked as at the minute of my birth the transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me for a moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis my first thought was is this then death have i indeed passed over forever into that other life but i could not well believe this as i could feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me my breath was coming in quick short gasps cold sweat stood out from every pore of my body and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed the fact that i was anything other than a wraith again was i suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave naked and unarmed as i was i had no desire to face the unseen thing which menaced me my revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which for some unfathomable reason i could not bring myself to touch my carbine was in its boot strapped to my saddle and as my horse had wandered off i was left without means of defense my only alternative seemed to lie in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the rustling sound from the thing which now seemed in the darkness of the cave and to my distorted imagination to be creeping stealthily upon me unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place i leaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear arizona night the crisp fresh mountain air outside the cave acted as an immediate tonic and i felt new life and new courage coursing through me pausing upon the brink of the ledge i upbraided myself for what now seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension i reasoned with myself that i had lain helpless for many hours within the cave yet nothing had molested me and my better judgment when permitted the direction of clear and logical reasoning convinced me that the noises i had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes probably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze had caused the sounds i heard i decided to investigate but first i lifted my head to fill my lungs with the pure invigorating night air of the mountains as i did so i saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge and level cacti studded flat wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of soft splendor and wondrous enchantment few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an arizona moonlit landscape the silvered mountains in the distance the strange lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo and the grotesque details of the stiff yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and inspiring as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse of some dead and forgotten world so different is it from the aspect of any other spot upon our earth as i stood thus meditating i turned my gaze from the landscape to the heavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy for the wonders of the earthly scene my attention was quickly riveted by a large red star close to the distant horizon as i gazed upon it i felt a spell of overpowering fascination it was mars the god of war and for me the fighting man it had always held the power of irresistible enchantment as i gazed at it on that far gone night it seemed to call across the unthinkable void to lure me to it to draw me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron my longing was beyond the power of opposition i closed my eyes stretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself drawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of space there was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness chapter iii my advent on mars i opened my eyes upon a strange and weird landscape i knew that i was on mars not once did i question either my sanity or my wakefulness i was not asleep no need for pinching here my inner consciousness told me as plainly that i was upon mars as your conscious mind tells you that you are upon earth you do not question the fact neither did i i found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish mosslike vegetation which stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles i seemed to be lying in a deep circular basin along the outer verge of which i could distinguish the irregularities of low hills it was midday the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it was rather intense upon my naked body yet no greater than would have been true under similar conditions on an arizona desert here and there were slight outcroppings of quartz bearing rock which glistened in the sunlight and a little to my left perhaps a hundred yards appeared a low walled enclosure about four feet in height no water and no other vegetation than the moss was in evidence and as i was somewhat thirsty i determined to do a little exploring springing to my feet i received my first martian surprise for the effort which on earth would have brought me standing upright carried me into the martian air to the height of about three yards i alighted softly upon the ground however without appreciable shock or jar now commenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous in the extreme i found that i must learn to walk all over again as the muscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon earth played strange antics with me upon mars instead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner my attempts to walk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground a couple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face or back at the end of each second or third hop my muscles perfectly attuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on earth played the mischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with the lesser gravitation and lower air pressure on mars i was determined however to explore the low structure which was the only evidence of habitation in sight and so i hit upon the unique plan of reverting to first principles in locomotion creeping i did fairly well at this and in a few moments had reached the low encircling wall of the enclosure there appeared to be no doors or windows upon the side nearest me but as the wall was but about four feet high i cautiously gained my feet and peered over the top upon the strangest sight it had ever been given me to see the roof of the enclosure was of solid glass about four or five inches in thickness and beneath this were several hundred large eggs perfectly round and snowy white the eggs were nearly uniform in size being about two and one half feet in diameter five or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which sat blinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity they seemed mostly head with little scrawny bodies long necks and six legs or as i afterward learned two legs and two arms with an intermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as arms or legs their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads a trifle above the center and protruded in such a manner that they could be directed either forward or back and also independently of each other thus permitting this queer animal to look in any direction or in two directions at once without the necessity of turning the head the ears which were slightly above the eyes and closer together were small cup shaped antennae protruding not more than an inch on these young specimens their noses were but longitudinal slits in the center of their faces midway between their mouths and ears there was no hair on their bodies which were of a very light yellowish green color in the adults as i was to learn quite soon this color deepens to an olive green and is darker in the male than in the female further the heads of the adults are not so out of proportion to their bodies as in the case of the young the iris of the eyes is blood red as in albinos while the pupil is dark the eyeball itself is very white as are the teeth these latter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and terrible countenance as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points which end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located the whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory but of the snowiest and most gleaming of china against the dark background of their olive skins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner making these weapons present a singularly formidable appearance most of these details i noted later for i was given but little time to speculate on the wonders of my new discovery i had seen that the eggs were in the process of hatching and as i stood watching the hideous little monsters break from their shells i failed to note the approach of a score of full grown martians from behind me coming as they did over the soft and soundless moss which covers practically the entire surface of mars with the exception of the frozen areas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts they might have captured me easily but their intentions were far more sinister it was the rattling of the accouterments of the foremost warrior which warned me on such a little thing my life hung that i often marvel that i escaped so easily had not the rifle of the leader of the party swung from its fastenings beside his saddle in such a way as to strike against the butt of his great metal shod spear i should have snuffed out without ever knowing that death was near me but the little sound caused me to turn and there upon me not ten feet from my breast was the point of that huge spear a spear forty feet long tipped with gleaming metal and held low at the side of a mounted replica of the little devils i had been watching but how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and terrific incarnation of hate of vengeance and of death the man himself for such i may call him was fully fifteen feet in height and on earth would have weighed some four hundred pounds he sat his mount as we sit a horse grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs while the hands of his two right arms held his immense spear low at the side of his mount his two left arms were outstretched laterally to help preserve his balance the thing he rode having neither bridle or reins of any description for guidance and his mount how can earthly words describe it it towered ten feet at the shoulder had four legs on either side a broad flat tail larger at the tip than at the root and which it held straight out behind while running a gaping mouth which split its head from its snout to its long massive neck like its master it was entirely devoid of hair but was of a dark slate color and exceeding smooth and glossy its belly was white and its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid yellow at the feet the feet themselves were heavily padded and nailless which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of their approach and in common with a multiplicity of legs is a characteristic feature of the fauna of mars the highest type of man and one other animal the only mammal existing on mars alone have well formed nails and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in existence there behind this first charging demon trailed nineteen others similar in all respects but as i learned later bearing individual characteristics peculiar to themselves precisely as no two of us are identical although we are all cast in a similar mold this picture or rather materialized nightmare which i have described at length made but one terrible and swift impression on me as i turned to meet it unarmed and naked as i was the first law of nature manifested itself in the only possible solution of my immediate problem and that was to get out of the vicinity of the point of the charging spear consequently i gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leap to reach the top of the martian incubator for such i had determined it must be my effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than it seemed to surprise the martian warriors for it carried me fully thirty feet into the air and landed me a hundred feet from my pursuers and on the opposite side of the enclosure i alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap and turning saw my enemies lined up along the further wall some were surveying me with expressions which i afterward discovered marked extreme astonishment and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that i had not molested their young they were conversing together in low tones and gesticulating and pointing toward me their discovery that i had not harmed the little martians and that i was unarmed must have caused them to look upon me with less ferocity but as i was to learn later the thing which weighed most in my favor was my exhibition of hurdling while the martians are immense their bones are very large and they are muscled only in proportion to the gravitation which they must overcome the result is that they are infinitely less agile and less powerful in proportion to their weight than an earth man and i doubt that were one of them suddenly to be transported to earth he could lift his own weight from the ground in fact i am convinced that he could not do so my feat then was as marvelous upon mars as it would have been upon earth and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon me as a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among their fellows the respite my unexpected agility had given me permitted me to formulate plans for the immediate future and to note more closely the appearance of the warriors for i could not disassociate these people in my mind from those other warriors who only the day before had been pursuing me i noted that each was armed with several other weapons in addition to the huge spear which i have described the weapon which caused me to decide against an attempt at escape by flight was what was evidently a rifle of some description and which i felt for some reason they were peculiarly efficient in handling these rifles were of a white metal stocked with wood which i learned later was a very light and intensely hard growth much prized on mars and entirely unknown to us denizens of earth the metal of the barrel is an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they have learned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel with which we are familiar the weight of these rifles is comparatively little and with the small caliber explosive radium projectiles which they use and the great length of the barrel they are deadly in the extreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on earth the theoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles but the best they can do in actual service when equipped with their wireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles this is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the martian firearm and some telepathic force must have warned me against an attempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty of these death dealing machines the martians after conversing for a short time turned and rode away in the direction from which they had come leaving one of their number alone by the enclosure when they had covered perhaps two hundred yards they halted and turning their mounts toward us sat watching the warrior by the enclosure he was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me and was evidently the leader of the band as i had noted that they seemed to have moved to their present position at his direction when his force had come to a halt he dismounted threw down his spear and small arms and came around the end of the incubator toward me entirely unarmed and as naked as i except for the ornaments strapped upon his head limbs and breast when he was within about fifty feet of me he unclasped an enormous metal armlet and holding it toward me in the open palm of his hand addressed me in a clear resonant voice but in a language it is needless to say i could not understand he then stopped as though waiting for my reply pricking up his antennae like ears and cocking his strange looking eyes still further toward me as the silence became painful i concluded to hazard a little conversation on my own part as i had guessed that he was making overtures of peace the throwing down of his weapons and the withdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me would have signified a peaceful mission anywhere on earth so why not then on mars placing my hand over my heart i bowed low to the martian and explained to him that while i did not understand his language his actions spoke for the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dear to my heart of course i might have been a babbling brook for all the intelligence my speech carried to him but he understood the action with which i immediately followed my words stretching my hand toward him i advanced and took the armlet from his open palm clasping it about my arm above the elbow smiled at him and stood waiting his wide mouth spread into an answering smile and locking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned and walked back toward his mount at the same time he motioned his followers to advance they started toward us on a wild run but were checked by a signal from him evidently he feared that were i to be really frightened again i might jump entirely out of the landscape he exchanged a few words with his men motioned to me that i would ride behind one of them and then mounted his own animal the fellow designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him on the glossy back of his mount where i hung on as best i could by the belts and straps which held the martian's weapons and ornaments the entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range of hills in the distance chapter iv a prisoner we had gone perhaps ten miles when the ground began to rise very rapidly we were as i was later to learn nearing the edge of one of mars long dead seas in the bottom of which my encounter with the martians had taken place in a short time we gained the foot of the mountains and after traversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley at the far extremity of which was a low table land upon which i beheld an enormous city toward this we galloped entering it by what appeared to be a ruined roadway leading out from the city but only to the edge of the table land where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps upon closer observation i saw as we passed them that the buildings were deserted and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not having been tenanted for years possibly for ages toward the center of the city was a large plaza and upon this and in the buildings immediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundred creatures of the same breed as my captors for such i now considered them despite the suave manner in which i had been trapped with the exception of their ornaments all were naked the women varied in appearance but little from the men except that their tusks were much larger in proportion to their height in some instances curving nearly to their high set ears their bodies were smaller and lighter in color and their fingers and toes bore the rudiments of nails which were entirely lacking among the males the adult females ranged in height from ten to twelve feet the children were light in color even lighter than the women and all looked precisely alike to me except that some were taller than others older i presumed i saw no signs of extreme age among them nor is there any appreciable difference in their appearance from the age of maturity about forty until at about the age of one thousand years they go voluntarily upon their last strange pilgrimage down the river iss which leads no living martian knows whither and from whose bosom no martian has ever returned or would be allowed to live did he return after once embarking upon its cold dark waters only about one martian in a thousand dies of sickness or disease and possibly about twenty take the voluntary pilgrimage the other nine hundred and seventy nine die violent deaths in duels in hunting in aviation and in war but perhaps by far the greatest death loss comes during the age of childhood when vast numbers of the little martians fall victims to the great white apes of mars the average life expectancy of a martian after the age of maturity is about three hundred years but would be nearer the one thousand mark were it not for the various means leading to violent death owing to the waning resources of the planet it evidently became necessary to counteract the increasing longevity which their remarkable skill in therapeutics and surgery produced and so human life has come to be considered but lightly on mars as is evidenced by their dangerous sports and the almost continual warfare between the various communities there are other and natural causes tending toward a diminution of population but nothing contributes so greatly to this end as the fact that no male or female martian is ever voluntarily without a weapon of destruction as we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we were immediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxious to pluck me from my seat behind my guard a word from the leader of the party stilled their clamor and we proceeded at a trot across the plaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye has rested upon the building was low but covered an enormous area it was constructed of gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones which sparkled and scintillated in the sunlight the main entrance was some hundred feet in width and projected from the building proper to form a huge canopy above the entrance hall there was no stairway but a gentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into an enormous chamber encircled by galleries on the floor of this chamber which was dotted with highly carved wooden desks and chairs were assembled about forty or fifty male martians around the steps of a rostrum on the platform proper squatted an enormous warrior heavily loaded with metal ornaments gay colored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappings ingeniously set with precious stones from his shoulders depended a short cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk what struck me as most remarkable about this assemblage and the hall in which they were congregated was the fact that the creatures were entirely out of proportion to the desks chairs and other furnishings these being of a size adapted to human beings such as i whereas the great bulks of the martians could scarcely have squeezed into the chairs nor was there room beneath the desks for their long legs evidently then there were other denizens on mars than the wild and grotesque creatures into whose hands i had fallen but the evidences of extreme antiquity which showed all around me indicated that these buildings might have belonged to some long extinct and forgotten race in the dim antiquity of mars our party had halted at the entrance to the building and at a sign from the leader i had been lowered to the ground again locking his arm in mine we had proceeded into the audience chamber there were few formalities observed in approaching the martian chieftain my captor merely strode up to the rostrum the others making way for him as he advanced the chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name of my escort who in turn halted and repeated the name of the ruler followed by his title at the time this ceremony and the words they uttered meant nothing to me but later i came to know that this was the customary greeting between green martians had the men been strangers and therefore unable to exchange names they would have silently exchanged ornaments had their missions been peaceful otherwise they would have exchanged shots or have fought out their introduction with some other of their various weapons my captor whose name was tars tarkas was virtually the vice chieftain of the community and a man of great ability as a statesman and warrior he evidently explained briefly the incidents connected with his expedition including my capture and when he had concluded the chieftain addressed me at some length i replied in our good old english tongue merely to convince him that neither of us could understand the other but i noticed that when i smiled slightly on concluding he did likewise this fact and the similar occurrence during my first talk with tars tarkas convinced me that we had at least something in common the ability to smile therefore to laugh denoting a sense of humor but i was to learn that the martian smile is merely perfunctory and that the martian laugh is a thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror the ideas of humor among the green men of mars are widely at variance with our conceptions of incitants to merriment the death agonies of a fellow being are to these strange creatures provocative of the wildest hilarity while their chief form of commonest amusement is to inflict death on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways the assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely feeling my muscles and the texture of my skin the principal chieftain then evidently signified a desire to see me perform and motioning me to follow he started with tars tarkas for the open plaza now i had made no attempt to walk since my first signal failure except while tightly grasping tars tarkas arm and so now i went skipping and flitting about among the desks and chairs like some monstrous grasshopper after bruising myself severely much to the amusement of the martians i again had recourse to creeping but this did not suit them and i was roughly jerked to my feet by a towering fellow who had laughed most heartily at my misfortunes as he banged me down upon my feet his face was bent close to mine and i did the only thing a gentleman might do under the circumstances of brutality boorishness and lack of consideration for a stranger's rights i swung my fist squarely to his jaw and he went down like a felled ox as he sunk to the floor i wheeled around with my back toward the nearest desk expecting to be overwhelmed by the vengeance of his fellows but determined to give them as good a battle as the unequal odds would permit before i gave up my life my fears were groundless however as the other martians at first struck dumb with wonderment finally broke into wild peals of laughter and applause i did not recognize the applause as such but later when i had become acquainted with their customs i learned that i had won what they seldom accord a manifestation of approbation the fellow whom i had struck lay where he had fallen nor did any of his mates approach him tars tarkas advanced toward me holding out one of his arms and we thus proceeded to the plaza without further mishap i did not of course know the reason for which we had come to the open but i was not long in being enlightened they first repeated the word sak a number of
x 1 who was endeavouring to reach my throat from in front while two more one on either side were lashing viciously at me with their tails the green warrior was much put to it to hold his own and i felt that the unequal struggle could last but a moment longer when the huge fellow discovered my plight and tearing himself from those that surrounded him he raked the assailant from my back with a single sweep of his blade and thus relieved i had little difficulty with the others once together we stood almost back to back against the great boulder and thus the creatures were prevented from soaring above us to deliver their deadly blows and as we were easily their match while they remained upon the ground we were making great headway in dispatching what remained of them when our attention was again attracted by the shrill wail of the caller above our heads this time i glanced up and far above us upon a little natural balcony on the face of the cliff stood a strange figure of a man shrieking out his shrill signal the while he waved one hand in the direction of the river's mouth as though beckoning to some one there and with the other pointed and gesticulated toward us a glance in the direction toward which he was looking was sufficient to apprise me of his aims and at the same time to fill me with the dread of dire apprehension for streaming in from all directions across the meadow from out of the forest and from the far distance of the flat land across the river i could see converging upon us a hundred different lines of wildly leaping creatures such as we were now engaged with and with them some strange new monsters which ran with great swiftness now erect and now upon all fours it will be a great death i said to my companion look as he shot a quick glance in the direction i indicated he smiled we may at least die fighting and as great warriors should john carter he replied we had just finished the last of our immediate antagonists as he spoke and i turned in surprised wonderment at the sound of my name and there before my astonished eyes i beheld the greatest of the green men of barsoom their shrewdest statesman their mightiest general my great and good friend tars tarkas jeddak of thark chapter ii a forest battle tars tarkas and i found no time for an exchange of experiences as we stood there before the great boulder surrounded by the corpses of our grotesque assailants for from all directions down the broad valley was streaming a perfect torrent of terrifying creatures in response to the weird call of the strange figure far above us come cried tars tarkas we must make for the cliffs there lies our only hope of even temporary escape there we may find a cave or a narrow ledge which two may defend for ever against this motley unarmed horde together we raced across the scarlet sward i timing my speed that i might not outdistance my slower companion we had perhaps three hundred yards to cover between our boulder and the cliffs and then to search out a suitable shelter for our stand against the terrifying things that were pursuing us they were rapidly overhauling us when tars tarkas cried to me to hasten ahead and discover if possible the sanctuary we sought the suggestion was a good one for thus many valuable minutes might be saved to us and throwing every ounce of my earthly muscles into the effort i cleared the remaining distance between myself and the cliffs in great leaps and bounds that put me at their base in a moment the cliffs rose perpendicular directly from the almost level sward of the valley there was no accumulation of fallen debris forming a more or less rough ascent to them as is the case with nearly all other cliffs i have ever seen the scattered boulders that had fallen from above and lay upon or partly buried in the turf were the only indication that any disintegration of the massive towering pile of rocks ever had taken place my first cursory inspection of the face of the cliffs filled my heart with forebodings since nowhere could i discern except where the weird herald stood still shrieking his shrill summons the faintest indication of even a bare foothold upon the lofty escarpment to my right the bottom of the cliff was lost in the dense foliage of the forest which terminated at its very foot rearing its gorgeous foliage fully a thousand feet against its stern and forbidding neighbour to the left the cliff ran apparently unbroken across the head of the broad valley to be lost in the outlines of what appeared to be a range of mighty mountains that skirted and confined the valley in every direction perhaps a thousand feet from me the river broke as it seemed directly from the base of the cliffs and as there seemed not the remotest chance for escape in that direction i turned my attention again toward the forest the cliffs towered above me a good five thousand feet the sun was not quite upon them and they loomed a dull yellow in their own shade here and there they were broken with streaks and patches of dusky red green and occasional areas of white quartz altogether they were very beautiful but i fear that i did not regard them with a particularly appreciative eye on this my first inspection of them just then i was absorbed in them only as a medium of escape and so as my gaze ran quickly time and again over their vast expanse in search of some cranny or crevice i came suddenly to loathe them as the prisoner must loathe the cruel and impregnable walls of his dungeon tars tarkas was approaching me rapidly and still more rapidly came the awful horde at his heels it seemed the forest now or nothing and i was just on the point of motioning tars tarkas to follow me in that direction when the sun passed the cliff's zenith and as the bright rays touched the dull surface it burst out into a million scintillant lights of burnished gold of flaming red of soft greens and gleaming whites a more gorgeous and inspiring spectacle human eye has never rested upon the face of the entire cliff was as later inspection conclusively proved so shot with veins and patches of solid gold as to quite present the appearance of a solid wall of that precious metal except where it was broken by outcroppings of ruby emerald and diamond boulders a faint and alluring indication of the vast and unguessable riches which lay deeply buried behind the magnificent surface but what caught my most interested attention at the moment that the sun's rays set the cliff's face a shimmer was the several black spots which now appeared quite plainly in evidence high across the gorgeous wall close to the forest's top and extending apparently below and behind the branches almost immediately i recognised them for what they were the dark openings of caves entering the solid walls possible avenues of escape or temporary shelter could we but reach them there was but a single way and that led through the mighty towering trees upon our right that i could scale them i knew full well but tars tarkas with his mighty bulk and enormous weight would find it a task possibly quite beyond his prowess or his skill for martians are at best but poor climbers upon the entire surface of that ancient planet i never before had seen a hill or mountain that exceeded four thousand feet in height above the dead sea bottoms and as the ascent was usually gradual nearly to their summits they presented but few opportunities for the practice of climbing nor would the martians have embraced even such opportunities as might present themselves for they could always find a circuitous route about the base of any eminence and these roads they preferred and followed in preference to the shorter but more arduous ways however there was nothing else to consider than an attempt to scale the trees contiguous to the cliff in an effort to reach the caves above the thark grasped the possibilities and the difficulties of the plan at once but there was no alternative and so we set out rapidly for the trees nearest the cliff our relentless pursuers were now close to us so close that it seemed that it would be an utter impossibility for the jeddak of thark to reach the forest in advance of them nor was there any considerable will in the efforts that tars tarkas made for the green men of barsoom do not relish flight nor ever before had i seen one fleeing from death in whatsoever form it might have confronted him but that tars tarkas was the bravest of the brave he had proven thousands of times yes tens of thousands in countless mortal combats with men and beasts and so i knew that there was another reason than fear of death behind his flight as he knew that a greater power than pride or honour spurred me to escape these fierce destroyers in my case it was love love of the divine dejah thoris and the cause of the thark's great and sudden love of life i could not fathom for it is oftener that they seek death than life these strange cruel loveless unhappy people at length however we reached the shadows of the forest while right behind us sprang the swiftest of our pursuers a giant plant man with claws outreaching to fasten his bloodsucking mouths upon us he was i should say a hundred yards in advance of his closest companion and so i called to tars tarkas to ascend a great tree that brushed the cliff's face while i dispatched the fellow thus giving the less agile thark an opportunity to reach the higher branches before the entire horde should be upon us and every vestige of escape cut off but i had reckoned without a just appreciation either of the cunning of my immediate antagonist or the swiftness with which his fellows were covering the distance which had separated them from me as i raised my long sword to deal the creature its death thrust it halted in its charge and as my sword cut harmlessly through the empty air the great tail of the thing swept with the power of a grizzly's arm across the sward and carried me bodily from my feet to the ground in an instant the brute was upon me but ere it could fasten its hideous mouths into my breast and throat i grasped a writhing tentacle in either hand the plant man was well muscled heavy and powerful but my earthly sinews and greater agility in conjunction with the deathly strangle hold i had upon him would have given me i think an eventual victory had we had time to discuss the merits of our relative prowess uninterrupted but as we strained and struggled about the tree into which tars tarkas was clambering with infinite difficulty i suddenly caught a glimpse over the shoulder of my antagonist of the great swarm of pursuers that now were fairly upon me now at last i saw the nature of the other monsters who had come with the plant men in response to the weird calling of the man upon the cliff's face they were that most dreaded of martian creatures great white apes of barsoom my former experiences upon mars had familiarized me thoroughly with them and their methods and i may say that of all the fearsome and terrible weird and grotesque inhabitants of that strange world it is the white apes that come nearest to familiarizing me with the sensation of fear i think that the cause of this feeling which these apes engender within me is due to their remarkable resemblance in form to our earth men which gives them a human appearance that is most uncanny when coupled with their enormous size they stand fifteen feet in height and walk erect upon their hind feet like the green martians they have an intermediary set of arms midway between their upper and lower limbs their eyes are very close set but do not protrude as do those of the green men of mars their ears are high set but more laterally located than are the green men's while their snouts and teeth are much like those of our african gorilla upon their heads grows an enormous shock of bristly hair it was into the eyes of such as these and the terrible plant men that i gazed above the shoulder of my foe and then in a mighty wave of snarling snapping screaming purring rage they swept over me and of all the sounds that assailed my ears as i went down beneath them to me the most hideous was the horrid purring of the plant men instantly a score of cruel fangs and keen talons were sunk into my flesh cold sucking lips fastened themselves upon my arteries i struggled to free myself and even though weighed down by these immense bodies i succeeded in struggling to my feet where still grasping my long sword and shortening my grip upon it until i could use it as a dagger i wrought such havoc among them that at one time i stood for an instant free what it has taken minutes to write occurred in but a few seconds but during that time tars tarkas had seen my plight and had dropped from the lower branches which he had reached with such infinite labour and as i flung the last of my immediate antagonists from me the great thark leaped to my side and again we fought back to back as we had done a hundred times before time and again the ferocious apes sprang in to close with us and time and again we beat them back with our swords the great tails of the plant men lashed with tremendous power about us as they charged from various directions or sprang with the agility of greyhounds above our heads but every attack met a gleaming blade in sword hands that had been reputed for twenty years the best that mars ever had known for tars tarkas and john carter were names that the fighting men of the world of warriors loved best to speak but even the two best swords in a world of fighters can avail not for ever against overwhelming numbers of fierce and savage brutes that know not what defeat means until cold steel teaches their hearts no longer to beat and so step by step we were forced back at length we stood against the giant tree that we had chosen for our ascent and then as charge after charge hurled its weight upon us we gave back again and again until we had been forced half way around the huge base of the colossal trunk tars tarkas was in the lead and suddenly i heard a little cry of exultation from him here is shelter for one at least john carter he said and glancing down i saw an opening in the base of the tree about three feet in diameter in with you tars tarkas i cried but he would not go saying that his bulk was too great for the little aperture while i might slip in easily we shall both die if we remain without john carter here is a slight chance for one of us take it and you may live to avenge me it is useless for me to attempt to worm my way into so small an opening with this horde of demons besetting us on all sides then we shall die together tars tarkas i replied for i shall not go first let me defend the opening while you get in then my smaller stature will permit me to slip in with you before they can prevent we still were fighting furiously as we talked in broken sentences punctured with vicious cuts and thrusts at our swarming enemy at length he yielded for it seemed the only way in which either of us might be saved from the ever increasing numbers of our assailants who were still swarming upon us from all directions across the broad valley it was ever your way john carter to think last of your own life he said but still more your way to command the lives and actions of others even to the greatest of jeddaks who rule upon barsoom there was a grim smile upon his cruel hard face as he the greatest jeddak of them all turned to obey the dictates of a creature of another world of a man whose stature was less than half his own if you fail john carter he said know that the cruel and heartless thark to whom you taught the meaning of friendship will come out to die beside you as you will my friend i replied but quickly now head first while i cover your retreat he hesitated a little at that word for never before in his whole life of continual strife had he turned his back upon aught than a dead or defeated enemy haste tars tarkas i urged or we shall both go down to profitless defeat i cannot hold them for ever alone as he dropped to the ground to force his way into the tree the whole howling pack of hideous devils hurled themselves upon me to right and left flew my shimmering blade now green with the sticky juice of a plant man now red with the crimson blood of a great white ape but always flying from one opponent to another hesitating but the barest fraction of a second to drink the lifeblood in the centre of some savage heart and thus i fought as i never had fought before against such frightful odds that i cannot realize even now that human muscles could have withstood that awful onslaught that terrific weight of hurtling tons of ferocious battling flesh with the fear that we would escape them the creatures redoubled their efforts to pull me down and though the ground about me was piled high with their dead and dying comrades they succeeded at last in overwhelming me and i went down beneath them for the second time that day and once again felt those awful sucking lips against my flesh but scarce had i fallen ere i felt powerful hands grip my ankles and in another second i was being drawn within the shelter of the tree's interior for a moment it was a tug of war between tars tarkas and a great plant man who clung tenaciously to my breast but presently i got the point of my long sword beneath him and with a mighty thrust pierced his vitals torn and bleeding from many cruel wounds i lay panting upon the ground within the hollow of the tree while tars tarkas defended the opening from the furious mob without for an hour they howled about the tree but after a few attempts to reach us they confined their efforts to terrorizing shrieks and screams to horrid growling on the part of the great white apes and the fearsome and indescribable purring by the plant men at length all but a score who had apparently been left to prevent our escape had left us and our adventure seemed destined to result in a siege the only outcome of which could be our death by starvation for even should we be able to slip out after dark whither in this unknown and hostile valley could we hope to turn our steps toward possible escape as the attacks of our enemies ceased and our eyes became accustomed to the semi darkness of the interior of our strange retreat i took the opportunity to explore our shelter the tree was hollow to an extent of about fifty feet in diameter and from its flat hard floor i judged that it had often been used to domicile others before our occupancy as i raised my eyes toward its roof to note the height i saw far above me a faint glow of light there was an opening above if we could but reach it we might still hope to make the shelter of the cliff caves my eyes had now become quite used to the subdued light of the interior and as i pursued my investigation i presently came upon a rough ladder at the far side of the cave quickly i mounted it only to find that it connected at the top with the lower of a series of horizontal wooden bars that spanned the now narrow and shaft like interior of the tree's stem these bars were set one above another about three feet apart and formed a perfect ladder as far above me as i could see dropping to the floor once more i detailed my discovery to tars tarkas who suggested that i explore aloft as far as i could go in safety while he guarded the entrance against a possible attack as i hastened above to explore the strange shaft i found that the ladder of horizontal bars mounted always as far above me as my eyes could reach and as i ascended the light from above grew brighter and brighter for fully five hundred feet i continued to climb until at length i reached the opening in the stem which admitted the light it was of about the same diameter as the entrance at the foot of the tree and opened directly upon a large flat limb the well worn surface of which testified to its long continued use as an avenue for some creature to and from this remarkable shaft i did not venture out upon the limb for fear that i might be discovered and our retreat in this direction cut off but instead hurried to retrace my steps to tars tarkas i soon reached him and presently we were both ascending the long ladder toward the opening above tars tarkas went in advance and as i reached the first of the horizontal bars i drew the ladder up after me and handing it to him he carried it a hundred feet further aloft where he wedged it safely between one of the bars and the side of the shaft in like manner i dislodged the lower bars as i passed them so that we soon had the interior of the tree denuded of all possible means of ascent for a distance of a hundred feet from the base thus precluding possible pursuit and attack from the rear as we were to learn later this precaution saved us from dire predicament and was eventually the means of our salvation when we reached the opening at the top tars tarkas drew to one side that i might pass out and investigate as owing to my lesser weight and greater agility i was better fitted for the perilous threading of this dizzy hanging pathway the limb upon which i found myself ascended at a slight angle toward the cliff and as i followed it i found that it terminated a few feet above a narrow ledge which protruded from the cliff's face at the entrance to a narrow cave as i approached the slightly more slender extremity of the branch it bent beneath my weight until as i balanced perilously upon its outer tip it swayed gently on a level with the ledge at a distance of a couple of feet five hundred feet below me lay the vivid scarlet carpet of the valley nearly five thousand feet above towered the mighty gleaming face of the gorgeous cliffs the cave that i faced was not one of those that i had seen from the ground and which lay much higher possibly a thousand feet but so far as i might know it was as good for our purpose as another and so i returned to the tree for tars tarkas together we wormed our way along the waving pathway but when we reached the end of the branch we found that our combined weight so depressed the limb that the cave's mouth was now too far above us to be reached we finally agreed that tars tarkas should return along the branch leaving his longest leather harness strap with me and that when the limb had risen to a height that would permit me to enter the cave i was to do so and on tars tarkas return i could then lower the strap and haul him up to the safety of the ledge this we did without mishap and soon found ourselves together upon the verge of a dizzy little balcony with a magnificent view of the valley spreading out below us as far as the eye could reach gorgeous forest and crimson sward skirted a silent sea and about all towered the brilliant monster guardian cliffs once we thought we discerned a gilded minaret gleaming in the sun amidst the waving tops of far distant trees but we soon abandoned the idea in the belief that it was but an hallucination born of our great desire to discover the haunts of civilized men in this beautiful yet forbidding spot below us upon the river's bank the great white apes were devouring the last remnants of tars tarkas former companions while great herds of plant men grazed in ever widening circles about the sward which they kept as close clipped as the smoothest of lawns knowing that attack from the tree was now improbable we determined to explore the cave which we had every reason to believe was but a continuation of the path we had already traversed leading the gods alone knew where but quite evidently away from this valley of grim ferocity as we advanced we found a well proportioned tunnel cut from the solid cliff its walls rose some twenty feet above the floor which was about five feet in width the roof was arched we had no means of making a light and so groped our way slowly into the ever increasing darkness tars tarkas keeping in touch with one wall while i felt along the other while to prevent our wandering into diverging branches and becoming separated or lost in some intricate and labyrinthine maze we clasped hands how far we traversed the tunnel in this manner i do not know but presently we came to an obstruction which blocked our further progress it seemed more like a partition than a sudden ending of the cave for it was constructed not of the material of the cliff but of something which felt like very hard wood silently i groped over its surface with my hands and presently was rewarded by the feel of the button which as commonly denotes a door on mars as does a door knob on earth gently pressing it i had the satisfaction of feeling the door slowly give before me and in another instant we were looking into a dimly lighted apartment which so far as we could see was unoccupied without more ado i swung the door wide open and followed by the huge thark stepped into the chamber as we stood for a moment in silence gazing about the room a slight noise behind caused me to turn quickly when to my astonishment i saw the door close with a sharp click as though by an unseen hand instantly i sprang toward it to wrench it open again for something in the uncanny movement of the thing and the tense and almost palpable silence of the chamber seemed to portend a lurking evil lying hidden in this rock bound chamber within the bowels of the golden cliffs my fingers clawed futilely at the unyielding portal while my eyes sought in vain for a duplicate of the button which had given us ingress and then from unseen lips a cruel and mocking peal of laughter rang through the desolate place chapter iii the chamber of mystery for moments after that awful laugh had ceased reverberating through the rocky room tars tarkas and i stood in tense and expectant silence but no further sound broke the stillness nor within the range of our vision did aught move at length tars tarkas laughed softly after the manner of his strange kind when in the presence of the horrible or terrifying it is not an hysterical laugh but rather the genuine expression of the pleasure they derive from the things that move earth men to loathing or to tears often and again have i seen them roll upon the ground in mad fits of uncontrollable mirth when witnessing the death agonies of women and little children beneath the torture of that hellish green martian fete the great games i looked up at the thark a smile upon my own lips for here in truth was greater need for a smiling face than a trembling chin what do you make of it all i asked where in the deuce are we he looked at me in surprise where are we he repeated do you tell me john carter that you know not where you be that i am upon barsoom is all that i can guess and but for you and the great white apes i should not even guess that for the sights i have seen this day are as unlike
x 1 are able to go for incredible periods without nourishment nor did i suffer the water of the river was sweet and cold for it was unpolluted by decaying bodies like the iss and as for food why the mere thought that i was nearing my beloved princess raised me above every material want as i proceeded the river became narrower and the current swift and turbulent so swift in fact that it was with difficulty that i forced my craft upward at all i could not have been making to exceed a hundred yards an hour when at a bend i was confronted by a series of rapids through which the river foamed and boiled at a terrific rate my heart sank within me the sorapus nutshell had proved a false prophet and after all my intuition had been correct it was the left hand channel that i should have followed had i been a woman i should have wept at my right was a great slow moving eddy that circled far beneath the cliff's overhanging side and to rest my tired muscles before turning back i let my boat drift into its embrace i was almost prostrated by disappointment it would mean another half day's loss of time to retrace my way and take the only passage that yet remained unexplored what hellish fate had led me to select from three possible avenues the two that were wrong as the lazy current of the eddy carried me slowly about the periphery of the watery circle my boat twice touched the rocky side of the river in the dark recess beneath the cliff a third time it struck gently as it had before but the contact resulted in a different sound the sound of wood scraping upon wood in an instant i was on the alert for there could be no wood within that buried river that had not been man brought almost coincidentally with my first apprehension of the noise my hand shot out across the boat's side and a second later i felt my fingers gripping the gunwale of another craft as though turned to stone i sat in tense and rigid silence straining my eyes into the utter darkness before me in an effort to discover if the boat were occupied it was entirely possible that there might be men on board it who were still ignorant of my presence for the boat was scraping gently against the rocks upon one side so that the gentle touch of my boat upon the other easily could have gone unnoticed peer as i would i could not penetrate the darkness and then i listened intently for the sound of breathing near me but except for the noise of the rapids the soft scraping of the boats and the lapping of the water at their sides i could distinguish no sound as usual i thought rapidly a rope lay coiled in the bottom of my own craft very softly i gathered it up and making one end fast to the bronze ring in the prow i stepped gingerly into the boat beside me in one hand i grasped the rope in the other my keen long sword for a full minute perhaps i stood motionless after entering the strange craft it had rocked a trifle beneath my weight but it had been the scraping of its side against the side of my own boat that had seemed most likely to alarm its occupants if there were any but there was no answering sound and a moment later i had felt from stem to stern and found the boat deserted groping with my hands along the face of the rocks to which the craft was moored i discovered a narrow ledge which i knew must be the avenue taken by those who had come before me that they could be none other than thurid and his party i was convinced by the size and build of the boat i had found calling to woola to follow me i stepped out upon the ledge the great savage brute agile as a cat crept after me as he passed through the boat that had been occupied by thurid and the therns he emitted a single low growl and when he came beside me upon the ledge and my hand rested upon his neck i felt his short mane bristling with anger i think he sensed telepathically the recent presence of an enemy for i had made no effort to impart to him the nature of our quest or the status of those we tracked this omission i now made haste to correct and after the manner of green martians with their beasts i let him know partially by the weird and uncanny telepathy of barsoom and partly by word of mouth that we were upon the trail of those who had recently occupied the boat through which we had just passed a soft purr like that of a great cat indicated that woola understood and then with a word to him to follow i turned to the right along the ledge but scarcely had i done so than i felt his mighty fangs tugging at my leathern harness as i turned to discover the cause of his act he continued to pull me steadily in the opposite direction nor would he desist until i had turned about and indicated that i would follow him voluntarily never had i known him to be in error in a matter of tracking so it was with a feeling of entire security that i moved cautiously in the huge beast's wake through cimmerian darkness he moved along the narrow ledge beside the boiling rapids as we advanced the way led from beneath the overhanging cliffs out into a dim light and then it was that i saw that the trail had been cut from the living rock and that it ran up along the river's side beyond the rapids for hours we followed the dark and gloomy river farther and farther into the bowels of mars from the direction and distance i knew that we must be well beneath the valley dor and possibly beneath the sea of omean as well it could not be much farther now to the temple of the sun even as my mind framed the thought woola halted suddenly before a narrow arched doorway in the cliff by the trail's side quickly he crouched back away from the entrance at the same time turning his eyes toward me words could not have more plainly told me that danger of some sort lay near by and so i pressed quietly forward to his side and passing him looked into the aperture at our right before me was a fair sized chamber that from its appointments i knew must have at one time been a guardroom there were racks for weapons and slightly raised platforms for the sleeping silks and furs of the warriors but now its only occupants were two of the therns who had been of the party with thurid and matai shang the men were in earnest conversation and from their tones it was apparent that they were entirely unaware that they had listeners i tell you one of them was saying i do not trust the black one there was no necessity for leaving us here to guard the way against what pray should we guard this long forgotten abysmal path it was but a ruse to divide our numbers he will have matai shang leave others elsewhere on some pretext or other and then at last he will fall upon us with his confederates and slay us all i believe you lakor replied the other there can never be aught else than deadly hatred between thern and first born and what think you of the ridiculous matter of the light let the light shine with the intensity of three radium units for fifty tals and for one xat let it shine with the intensity of one radium unit and then for twenty five tals with nine units those were his very words and to think that wise old matai shang should listen to such foolishness indeed it is silly replied lakor it will open nothing other than the way to a quick death for us all he had to make some answer when matai shang asked him flatly what he should do when he came to the temple of the sun and so he made his answer quickly from his imagination i would wager a hekkador's diadem that he could not now repeat it himself let us not remain here longer lakor spoke the other thern perchance if we hasten after them we may come in time to rescue matai shang and wreak our own vengeance upon the black dator what say you never in a long life answered lakor have i disobeyed a single command of the father of therns i shall stay here until i rot if he does not return to bid me elsewhere lakor's companion shook his head you are my superior he said i cannot do other than you sanction though i still believe that we are foolish to remain i too thought that they were foolish to remain for i saw from woola's actions that the trail led through the room where the two therns held guard i had no reason to harbor any considerable love for this race of self deified demons yet i would have passed them by were it possible without molesting them it was worth trying anyway for a fight might delay us considerably or even put an end entirely to my search better men than i have gone down before fighters of meaner ability than that possessed by the fierce thern warriors signaling woola to heel i stepped suddenly into the room before the two men at sight of me their long swords flashed from the harness at their sides but i raised my hand in a gesture of restraint i seek thurid the black dator i said my quarrel is with him not with you let me pass then in peace for if i mistake not he is as much your enemy as mine and you can have no cause to protect him they lowered their swords and lakor spoke i know not whom you may be with the white skin of a thern and the black hair of a red man but were it only thurid whose safety were at stake you might pass and welcome in so far as we be concerned tell us who you be and what mission calls you to this unknown world beneath the valley dor then maybe we can see our way to let you pass upon the errand which we should like to undertake would our orders permit i was surprised that neither of them had recognized me for i thought that i was quite sufficiently well known either by personal experience or reputation to every thern upon barsoom as to make my identity immediately apparent in any part of the planet in fact i was the only white man upon mars whose hair was black and whose eyes were gray with the exception of my son carthoris to reveal my identity might be to precipitate an attack for every thern upon barsoom knew that to me they owed the fall of their age old spiritual supremacy on the other hand my reputation as a fighting man might be sufficient to pass me by these two were their livers not of the right complexion to welcome a battle to the death to be quite candid i did not attempt to delude myself with any such sophistry since i knew well that upon war like mars there are few cowards and that every man whether prince priest or peasant glories in deadly strife and so i gripped my long sword the tighter as i replied to lakor i believe that you will see the wisdom of permitting me to pass unmolested i said for it would avail you nothing to die uselessly in the rocky bowels of barsoom merely to protect a hereditary enemy such as thurid dator of the first born that you shall die should you elect to oppose me is evidenced by the moldering corpses of all the many great barsoomian warriors who have gone down beneath this blade i am john carter prince of helium for a moment that name seemed to paralyze the two men but only for a moment and then the younger of them with a vile name upon his lips rushed toward me with ready sword he had been standing a little behind his companion lakor during our parley and now ere he could engage me the older man grasped his harness and drew him back hold commanded lakor there will be plenty of time to fight if we find it wise to fight at all there be good reasons why every thern upon barsoom should yearn to spill the blood of the blasphemer the sacrilegist but let us mix wisdom with our righteous hate the prince of helium is bound upon an errand which we ourselves but a moment since were wishing that we might undertake let him go then and slay the black when he returns we shall still be here to bar his way to the outer world and thus we shall have rid ourselves of two enemies nor have incurred the displeasure of the father of therns as he spoke i could not but note the crafty glint in his evil eyes and while i saw the apparent logic of his reasoning i felt subconsciously perhaps that his words did but veil some sinister intent the other thern turned toward him in evident surprise but when lakor had whispered a few brief words into his ear he too drew back and nodded acquiescence to his superior's suggestion proceed john carter said lakor but know that if thurid does not lay you low there will be those awaiting your return who will see that you never pass again into the sunlight of the upper world go during our conversation woola had been growling and bristling close to my side occasionally he would look up into my face with a low pleading whine as though begging for the word that would send him headlong at the bare throats before him he too sensed the villainy behind the smooth words beyond the therns several doorways opened off the guardroom and toward the one upon the extreme right lakor motioned that way leads to thurid he said but when i would have called woola to follow me there the beast whined and held back and at last ran quickly to the first opening at the left where he stood emitting his coughing bark as though urging me to follow him upon the right way i turned a questioning look upon lakor the brute is seldom wrong i said and while i do not doubt your superior knowledge thern i think that i shall do well to listen to the voice of instinct that is backed by love and loyalty as i spoke i smiled grimly that he might know without words that i distrusted him as you will the fellow replied with a shrug in the end it shall be all the same i turned and followed woola into the left hand passage and though my back was toward my enemies my ears were on the alert yet i heard no sound of pursuit the passageway was dimly lighted by occasional radium bulbs the universal lighting medium of barsoom these same lamps may have been doing continuous duty in these subterranean chambers for ages since they require no attention and are so compounded that they give off but the minutest of their substance in the generation of years of luminosity we had proceeded for but a short distance when we commenced to pass the mouths of diverging corridors but not once did woola hesitate it was at the opening to one of these corridors upon my right that i presently heard a sound that spoke more plainly to john carter fighting man than could the words of my mother tongue it was the clank of metal the metal of a warrior's harness and it came from a little distance up the corridor upon my right woola heard it too and like a flash he had wheeled and stood facing the threatened danger his mane all abristle and all his rows of glistening fangs bared by snarling backdrawn lips with a gesture i silenced him and together we drew aside into another corridor a few paces farther on here we waited nor did we have long to wait for presently we saw the shadows of two men fall upon the floor of the main corridor athwart the doorway of our hiding place very cautiously they were moving now the accidental clank that had alarmed me was not repeated presently they came opposite our station nor was i surprised to see that the two were lakor and his companion of the guardroom they walked very softly and in the right hand of each gleamed a keen long sword they halted quite close to the entrance of our retreat whispering to each other can it be that we have distanced them already said lakor either that or the beast has led the man upon a wrong trail replied the other for the way which we took is by far the shorter to this point for him who knows it john carter would have found it a short road to death had he taken it as you suggested to him yes said lakor no amount of fighting ability would have saved him from the pivoted flagstone he surely would have stepped upon it and by now if the pit beneath it has a bottom which thurid denies he should have been rapidly approaching it curses on that calot of his that warned him toward the safer avenue there be other dangers ahead of him though spoke lakor's fellow which he may not so easily escape should he succeed in escaping our two good swords consider for example what chance he will have coming unexpectedly into the chamber of i would have given much to have heard the balance of that conversation that i might have been warned of the perils that lay ahead but fate intervened and just at the very instant of all other instants that i would not have elected to do it i sneezed the temple of the sun there was nothing for it now other than to fight nor did i have any advantage as i sprang sword in hand into the corridor before the two therns for my untimely sneeze had warned them of my presence and they were ready for me there were no words for they would have been a waste of breath the very presence of the two proclaimed their treachery that they were following to fall upon me unawares was all too plain and they of course must have known that i understood their plan in an instant i was engaged with both and though i loathe the very name of thern i must in all fairness admit that they are mighty swordsmen and these two were no exception unless it were that they were even more skilled and fearless than the average among their race while it lasted it was indeed as joyous a conflict as i ever had experienced twice at least i saved my breast from the mortal thrust of piercing steel only by the wondrous agility with which my earthly muscles endow me under the conditions of lesser gravity and air pressure upon mars yet even so i came near to tasting death that day in the gloomy corridor beneath mars's southern pole for lakor played a trick upon me that in all my experience of fighting upon two planets i never before had witnessed the like of the other thern was engaging me at the time and i was forcing him back touching him here and there with my point until he was bleeding from a dozen wounds yet not being able to penetrate his marvelous guard to reach a vulnerable spot for the brief instant that would have been sufficient to send him to his ancestors it was then that lakor quickly unslung a belt from his harness and as i stepped back to parry a wicked thrust he lashed one end of it about my left ankle so that it wound there for an instant while he jerked suddenly upon the other end throwing me heavily upon my back then like leaping panthers they were upon me but they had reckoned without woola and before ever a blade touched me a roaring embodiment of a thousand demons hurtled above my prostrate form and my loyal martian calot was upon them imagine if you can a huge grizzly with ten legs armed with mighty talons and an enormous froglike mouth splitting his head from ear to ear exposing three rows of long white tusks then endow this creature of your imagination with the agility and ferocity of a half starved bengal tiger and the strength of a span of bulls and you will have some faint conception of woola in action before i could call him off he had crushed lakor into a jelly with a single blow of one mighty paw and had literally torn the other thern to ribbons yet when i spoke to him sharply he cowed sheepishly as though he had done a thing to deserve censure and chastisement never had i had the heart to punish woola during the long years that had passed since that first day upon mars when the green jed of the tharks had placed him on guard over me and i had won his love and loyalty from the cruel and loveless masters of his former life yet i believe he would have submitted to any cruelty that i might have inflicted upon him so wondrous was his affection for me the diadem in the center of the circlet of gold upon the brow of lakor proclaimed him a holy thern while his companion not thus adorned was a lesser thern though from his harness i gleaned that he had reached the ninth cycle which is but one below that of the holy therns as i stood for a moment looking at the gruesome havoc woola had wrought there recurred to me the memory of that other occasion upon which i had masqueraded in the wig diadem and harness of sator throg the holy thern whom thuvia of ptarth had slain and now it occurred to me that it might prove of worth to utilize lakor's trappings for the same purpose a moment later i had torn his yellow wig from his bald pate and transferred it and the circlet as well as all his harness to my own person woola did not approve of the metamorphosis he sniffed at me and growled ominously but when i spoke to him and patted his huge head he at length became reconciled to the change and at my command trotted off along the corridor in the direction we had been going when our progress had been interrupted by the therns we moved cautiously now warned by the fragment of conversation i had overheard i kept abreast of woola that we might have the benefit of all our eyes for what might appear suddenly ahead to menace us and well it was that we were forewarned at the bottom of a flight of narrow steps the corridor turned sharply back upon itself immediately making another turn in the original direction so that at that point it formed a perfect letter s the top leg of which debouched suddenly into a large chamber illy lighted and the floor of which was completely covered by venomous snakes and loathsome reptiles to have attempted to cross that floor would have been to court instant death and for a moment i was almost completely discouraged then it occurred to me that thurid and matai shang with their party must have crossed it and so there was a way had it not been for the fortunate accident by which i overheard even so small a portion of the therns conversation we should have blundered at least a step or two into that wriggling mass of destruction and a single step would have been all sufficient to have sealed our doom these were the only reptiles i had ever seen upon barsoom but i knew from their similarity to the fossilized remains of supposedly extinct species i had seen in the museums of helium that they comprised many of the known prehistoric reptilian genera as well as others undiscovered a more hideous aggregation of monsters had never before assailed my vision it would be futile to attempt to describe them to earth men since substance is the only thing which they possess in common with any creature of the past or present with which you are familiar even their venom is of an unearthly virulence that by comparison would make the cobra de capello seem quite as harmless as an angleworm as they spied me there was a concerted rush by those nearest the entrance where we stood but a line of radium bulbs inset along the threshold of their chamber brought them to a sudden halt evidently they dared not cross that line of light i had been quite sure that they would not venture beyond the room in which i had discovered them though i had not guessed at what deterred them the simple fact that we had found no reptiles in the corridor through which we had just come was sufficient assurance that they did not venture there i drew woola out of harm's way and then began a careful survey of as much of the chamber of reptiles as i could see from where i stood as my eyes became accustomed to the dim light of its interior i gradually made out a low gallery at the far end of the apartment from which opened several exits coming as close to the threshold as i dared i followed this gallery with my eyes discovering that it circled the room as far as i could see then i glanced above me along the upper edge of the entrance to which we had come and there to my delight i saw an end of the gallery not a foot above my head in an instant i had leaped to it and called woola after me here there were no reptiles the way was clear to the opposite side of the hideous chamber and a moment later woola and i dropped down to safety in the corridor beyond not ten minutes later we came into a vast circular apartment of white marble the walls of which were inlaid with gold in the strange hieroglyphics of the first born from the high dome of this mighty apartment a huge circular column extended to the floor and as i watched i saw that it slowly revolved i had reached the base of the temple of the sun somewhere above me lay dejah thoris and with her were phaidor daughter of matai shang and thuvia of ptarth but how to reach them now that i had found the only vulnerable spot in their mighty prison was still a baffling riddle slowly i circled the great shaft looking for a means of ingress part way around i found a tiny radium flash torch and as i examined it in mild curiosity as to its presence there in this almost inaccessible and unknown spot i came suddenly upon the insignia of the house of thurid jewel inset in its metal case i am upon the right trail i thought as i slipped the bauble into the pocket pouch which hung from my harness then i continued my search for the entrance which i knew must be somewhere about nor had i long to search for almost immediately thereafter i came upon a small door so cunningly inlaid in the shaft's base that it might have passed unnoticed by a less keen or careful observer there was the door that would lead me within the prison but where was the means to open it no button or lock were visible again and again i went carefully over every square inch of its surface but the most that i could find was a tiny pinhole a little above and to the right of the door's center a pinhole that seemed only an accident of manufacture or an imperfection of material into this minute aperture i attempted to peer but whether it was but a fraction of an inch deep or passed completely through the door i could not tell at least no light showed beyond it i put my ear to it next and listened but again my efforts brought negligible results during these experiments woola had been standing at my side gazing intently at the door and as my glance fell upon him it occurred to me to test the correctness of my hypothesis that this portal had been the means of ingress to the temple used by thurid the black dator and matai shang father of therns turning away abruptly i called to him to follow me for a moment he hesitated and then leaped after me whining and tugging at my harness to draw me back i walked on however some distance from the door before i let him have his way that i might see precisely what he would do then i permitted
x 1 thuvia of ptarth saw only strangers warriors in the harness of dusar now she took fright but too late before she could voice but a single cry rough hands seized her a heavy silken scarf was wound about her head she was lifted in strong arms and borne to the deck of the flier there was the sudden whirl of propellers the rushing of air against her body and from far beneath the shouting and the challenge from the guard racing toward the south another flier sped toward helium in its cabin a tall red man bent over the soft sole of an upturned sandal with delicate instruments he measured the faint imprint of a small object which appeared there upon a pad beside him was the outline of a key and here he noted the results of his measurements a smile played upon his lips as he completed his task and turned to one who waited at the opposite side of the table the man is a genius he remarked only a genius could have evolved such a lock as this is designed to spring here take the sketch larok and give all thine own genius full and unfettered freedom in reproducing it in metal the warrior artificer bowed man builds naught he said that man may not destroy then he left the cabin with the sketch as dawn broke upon the lofty towers which mark the twin cities of helium the scarlet tower of one and the yellow tower of its sister a flier floated lazily out of the north upon its bow was emblazoned the signia of a lesser noble of a far city of the empire of helium its leisurely approach and the evident confidence with which it moved across the city aroused no suspicion in the minds of the sleepy guard their round of duty nearly done they had little thought beyond the coming of those who were to relieve them peace reigned throughout helium stagnant emasculating peace helium had no enemies there was naught to fear without haste the nearest air patrol swung sluggishly about and approached the stranger at easy speaking distance the officer upon her deck hailed the incoming craft the cheery kaor and the plausible explanation that the owner had come from distant parts for a few days of pleasure in gay helium sufficed the air patrol boat sheered off passing again upon its way the stranger continued toward a public landing stage where she dropped into the ways and came to rest at about the same time a warrior entered her cabin it is done vas kor he said handing a small metal key to the tall noble who had just risen from his sleeping silks and furs good exclaimed the latter you must have worked upon it all during the night larok the warrior nodded now fetch me the heliumetic metal you wrought some days since commanded vas kor this done the warrior assisted his master to replace the handsome jewelled metal of his harness with the plainer ornaments of an ordinary fighting man of helium and with the insignia of the same house that appeared upon the bow of the flier vas kor breakfasted on board then he emerged upon the aerial dock entered an elevator and was borne quickly to the street below where he was soon engulfed by the early morning throng of workers hastening to their daily duties among them his warrior trappings were no more remarkable than is a pair of trousers upon broadway all martian men are warriors save those physically unable to bear arms the tradesman and his clerk clank with their martial trappings as they pursue their vocations the schoolboy coming into the world as he does almost adult from the snowy shell that has encompassed his development for five long years knows so little of life without a sword at his hip that he would feel the same discomfiture at going abroad unarmed that an earth boy would experience in walking the streets knicker bockerless vas kor's destination lay in greater helium which lies some seventy five miles across the level plain from lesser helium he had landed at the latter city because the air patrol is less suspicious and alert than that above the larger metropolis where lies the palace of the jeddak as he moved with the throng in the parklike canyon of the thoroughfare the life of an awakening martian city was in evidence about him houses raised high upon their slender metal columns for the night were dropping gently toward the ground among the flowers upon the scarlet sward which lies about the buildings children were already playing and comely women laughing and chatting with their neighbours as they culled gorgeous blossoms for the vases within doors the pleasant kaor of the barsoomian greeting fell continually upon the ears of the stranger as friends and neighbours took up the duties of a new day the district in which he had landed was residential a district of merchants of the more prosperous sort everywhere were evidences of luxury and wealth slaves appeared upon every housetop with gorgeous silks and costly furs laying them in the sun for airing jewel encrusted women lolled even thus early upon the carven balconies before their sleeping apartments later in the day they would repair to the roofs when the slaves had arranged couches and pitched silken canopies to shade them from the sun strains of inspiring music broke pleasantly from open windows for the martians have solved the problem of attuning the nerves pleasantly to the sudden transition from sleep to waking that proves so difficult a thing for most earth folk above him raced the long light passenger fliers plying each in its proper plane between the numerous landing stages for internal passenger traffic landing stages that tower high into the heavens are for the great international passenger liners freighters have other landing stages at various lower levels to within a couple of hundred feet of the ground nor dare any flier rise or drop from one plane to another except in certain restricted districts where horizontal traffic is forbidden along the close cropped sward which paves the avenue ground fliers were moving in continuous lines in opposite directions for the greater part they skimmed along the surface of the sward soaring gracefully into the air at times to pass over a slower going driver ahead or at intersections where the north and south traffic has the right of way and the east and west must rise above it from private hangars upon many a roof top fliers were darting into the line of traffic gay farewells and parting admonitions mingled with the whirring of motors and the subdued noises of the city yet with all the swift movement and the countless thousands rushing hither and thither the predominant suggestion was that of luxurious ease and soft noiselessness martians dislike harsh discordant clamour the only loud noises they can abide are the martial sounds of war the clash of arms the collision of two mighty dreadnoughts of the air to them there is no sweeter music than this at the intersection of two broad avenues vas kor descended from the street level to one of the great pneumatic stations of the city here he paid before a little wicket the fare to his destination with a couple of the dull oval coins of helium beyond the gatekeeper he came to a slowly moving line of what to earthly eyes would have appeared to be conical nosed eight foot projectiles for some giant gun in slow procession the things moved in single file along a grooved track a half dozen attendants assisted passengers to enter or directed these carriers to their proper destination vas kor approached one that was empty upon its nose was a dial and a pointer he set the pointer for a certain station in greater helium raised the arched lid of the thing stepped in and lay down upon the upholstered bottom an attendant closed the lid which locked with a little click and the carrier continued its slow way presently it switched itself automatically to another track to enter a moment later one of the series of dark mouthed tubes the instant that its entire length was within the black aperture it sprang forward with the speed of a rifle ball there was an instant of whizzing a soft though sudden stop and slowly the carrier emerged upon another platform another attendant raised the lid and vas kor stepped out at the station beneath the centre of greater helium seventy five miles from the point at which he had embarked here he sought the street level stepping immediately into a waiting ground flier he spoke no word to the slave sitting in the driver's seat it was evident that he had been expected and that the fellow had received his instructions before his coming scarcely had vas kor taken his seat when the flier went quickly into the fast moving procession turning presently from the broad and crowded avenue into a less congested street presently it left the thronged district behind to enter a section of small shops where it stopped before the entrance to one which bore the sign of a dealer in foreign silks vas kor entered the low ceiling room a man at the far end motioned him toward an inner apartment giving no further sign of recognition until he had passed in after the caller and closed the door then he faced his visitor saluting deferentially most noble he commenced but vas kor silenced him with a gesture no formalities he said we must forget that i am aught other than your slave if all has been as carefully carried out as it has been planned we have no time to waste instead we should be upon our way to the slave market are you ready the merchant nodded and turning to a great chest produced the unemblazoned trappings of a slave these vas kor immediately donned then the two passed from the shop through a rear door traversed a winding alley to an avenue beyond where they entered a flier which awaited them five minutes later the merchant was leading his slave to the public market where a great concourse of people filled the great open space in the centre of which stood the slave block the crowds were enormous to day for carthoris prince of helium was to be the principal bidder one by one the masters mounted the rostrum beside the slave block upon which stood their chattels briefly and clearly each recounted the virtues of his particular offering when all were done the major domo of the prince of helium recalled to the block such as had favourably impressed him for such he had made a fair offer there was little haggling as to price and none at all when vas kor was placed upon the block his merchant master accepted the first offer that was made for him and thus a dusarian noble entered the household of carthoris chapter iii treachery the day following the coming of vas kor to the palace of the prince of helium great excitement reigned throughout the twin cities reaching its climax in the palace of carthoris word had come of the abduction of thuvia of ptarth from her father's court and with it the veiled hint that the prince of helium might be suspected of considerable knowledge of the act and the whereabouts of the princess in the council chamber of john carter warlord of mars was tardos mors jeddak of helium mors kajak his son jed of lesser helium carthoris and a score of the great nobles of the empire there must be no war between ptarth and helium my son said john carter that you are innocent of the charge that has been placed against you by insinuation we well know but thuvan dihn must know it well too there is but one who may convince him and that one be you you must hasten at once to the court of ptarth and by your presence there as well as by your words assure him that his suspicions are groundless bear with you the authority of the warlord of barsoom and of the jeddak of helium to offer every resource of the allied powers to assist thuvan dihn to recover his daughter and punish her abductors whomsoever they may be go i know that i do not need to urge upon you the necessity for haste carthoris left the council chamber and hastened to his palace here slaves were busy in a moment setting things to rights for the departure of their master several worked about the swift flier that would bear the prince of helium rapidly toward ptarth at last all was done but two armed slaves remained on guard the setting sun hung low above the horizon in a moment darkness would envelop all one of the guardsmen a giant of a fellow across whose right cheek there ran a thin scar from temple to mouth approached his companion his gaze was directed beyond and above his comrade when he had come quite close he spoke what strange craft is that he asked the other turned about quickly to gaze heavenward scarce was his back turned toward the giant than the short sword of the latter was plunged beneath his left shoulder blade straight through his heart voiceless the soldier sank in his tracks stone dead quickly the murderer dragged the corpse into the black shadows within the hangar then he returned to the flier drawing a cunningly wrought key from his pocket pouch he removed the cover of the right hand dial of the controlling destination compass for a moment he studied the construction of the mechanism beneath then he returned the dial to its place set the pointer and removed it again to note the resultant change in the position of the parts affected by the act a smile crossed his lips with a pair of cutters he snipped off the projection which extended through the dial from the external pointer now the latter might be moved to any point upon the dial without affecting the mechanism below in other words the eastern hemisphere dial was useless now he turned his attention to the western dial this he set upon a certain point afterward he removed the cover of this dial also and with keen tool cut the steel finger from the under side of the pointer as quickly as possible he replaced the second dial cover and resumed his place on guard to all intents and purposes the compass was as efficient as before but as a matter of fact the moving of the pointers upon the dials resulted now in no corresponding shift of the mechanism beneath and the device was set immovably upon a destination of the slave's own choosing presently came carthoris accompanied by but a handful of his gentlemen he cast but a casual glance upon the single slave who stood guard the fellow's thin cruel lips and the sword cut that ran from temple to mouth aroused the suggestion of an unpleasant memory within him he wondered where saran tal had found the man then the matter faded from his thoughts and in another moment the prince of helium was laughing and chatting with his companions though below the surface his heart was cold with dread for what contingencies confronted thuvia of ptarth he could not even guess first to his mind naturally had sprung the thought that astok of dusar had stolen the fair ptarthian but almost simultaneously with the report of the abduction had come news of the great fetes at dusar in honour of the return of the jeddak's son to the court of his father it could not have been he thought carthoris for on the very night that thuvia was taken astok had been in dusar and yet he entered the flier exchanging casual remarks with his companions as he unlocked the mechanism of the compass and set the pointer upon the capital city of ptarth with a word of farewell he touched the button which controlled the repulsive rays and as the flier rose lightly into the air the engine purred in answer to the touch of his finger upon a second button the propellers whirred as his hand drew back the speed lever and carthoris prince of helium was off into the gorgeous martian night beneath the hurtling moons and the million stars scarce had the flier found its speed ere the man wrapping his sleeping silks and furs about him stretched at full length upon the narrow deck to sleep but sleep did not come at once at his bidding instead his thoughts ran riot in his brain driving sleep away he recalled the words of thuvia of ptarth words that had half assured him that she loved him for when he had asked her if she loved kulan tith she had answered only that she was promised to him now he saw that her reply was open to more than a single construction it might of course mean that she did not love kulan tith and so by inference be taken to mean that she loved another but what assurance was there that the other was carthoris of helium the more he thought upon it the more positive he became that not only was there no assurance in her words that she loved him but none either in any act of hers no the fact was she did not love him she loved another she had not been abducted she had fled willingly with her lover with such pleasant thoughts filling him alternately with despair and rage carthoris at last dropped into the sleep of utter mental exhaustion the breaking of the sudden dawn found him still asleep his flier was rushing swiftly above a barren ochre plain the world old bottom of a long dead martian sea in the distance rose low hills toward these the craft was headed as it approached them a great promontory might have been seen from its deck stretching out into what had once been a mighty ocean and circling back once more to enclose the forgotten harbour of a forgotten city which still stretched back from its deserted quays an imposing pile of wondrous architecture of a long dead past the countless dismal windows vacant and forlorn stared sightless from their marble walls the whole sad city taking on the semblance of scattered mounds of dead men's sun bleached skulls the casements having the appearance of eyeless sockets the portals grinning jaws closer came the flier but now its speed was diminishing yet this was not ptarth above the central plaza it stopped slowly settling marsward within a hundred yards of the ground it came to rest floating gently in the light air and at the same instant an alarm sounded at the sleeper's ear carthoris sprang to his feet below him he looked to see the teeming metropolis of ptarth beside him already there should have been an air patrol he gazed about in bewildered astonishment there indeed was a great city but it was not ptarth no multitudes surged through its broad avenues no signs of life broke the dead monotony of its deserted roof tops no gorgeous silks no priceless furs lent life and colour to the cold marble and the gleaming ersite no patrol boat lay ready with its familiar challenge silent and empty lay the great city empty and silent the surrounding air what had happened carthoris examined the dial of his compass the pointer was set upon ptarth could the creature of his genius have thus betrayed him he would not believe it quickly he unlocked the cover turning it back upon its hinge a single glance showed him the truth or at least a part of it the steel projection that communicated the movement of the pointer upon the dial to the heart of the mechanism beneath had been severed who could have done the thing and why carthoris could not hazard even a faint guess but the thing now was to learn in what portion of the world he was and then take up his interrupted journey once more if it had been the purpose of some enemy to delay him he had succeeded well thought carthoris as he unlocked the cover of the second dial the first having shown that its pointer had not been set at all beneath the second dial he found the steel pin severed as in the other but the controlling mechanism had first been set for a point upon the western hemisphere he had just time to judge his location roughly at some place south west of helium and at a considerable distance from the twin cities when he was startled by a woman's scream beneath him leaning over the side of the flier he saw what appeared to be a red woman being dragged across the plaza by a huge green warrior one of those fierce cruel denizens of the dead sea bottoms and deserted cities of dying mars carthoris waited to see no more reaching for the control board he sent his craft racing plummet like toward the ground the green man was hurrying his captive toward a huge thoat that browsed upon the ochre vegetation of the once scarlet gorgeous plaza at the same instant a dozen red warriors leaped from the entrance of a nearby ersite palace pursuing the abductor with naked swords and shouts of rageful warning once the woman turned her face upward toward the falling flier and in the single swift glance carthoris saw that it was thuvia of ptarth chapter iv a green man's captive when the light of day broke upon the little craft to whose deck the princess of ptarth had been snatched from her father's garden thuvia saw that the night had wrought a change in her abductors no longer did their trappings gleam with the metal of dusar but instead there was emblazoned there the insignia of the prince of helium the girl felt renewed hope for she could not believe that in the heart of carthoris could lie intent to harm her she spoke to the warrior squatting before the control board last night you wore the trappings of a dusarian she said now your metal is that of helium what means it the man looked at her with a grin the prince of helium is no fool he said just then an officer emerged from the tiny cabin he reprimanded the warrior for conversing with the prisoner nor would he himself reply to any of her inquiries no harm was offered her during the journey and so they came at last to their destination with the girl no wiser as to her abductors or their purpose than at first here the flier settled slowly into the plaza of one of those mute monuments of mars dead and forgotten past the deserted cities that fringe the sad ochre sea bottoms where once rolled the mighty floods upon whose bosoms moved the maritime commerce of the peoples that are gone for ever thuvia of ptarth was no stranger to such places during her wanderings in search of the river iss that time she had set out upon what for countless ages had been the last long pilgrimage of martians toward the valley dor where lies the lost sea of korus she had encountered several of these sad reminders of the greatness and the glory of ancient barsoom and again during her flight from the temples of the holy therns with tars tarkas jeddak of thark she had seen them with their weird and ghostly inmates the great white apes of barsoom she knew too that many of them were used now by the nomadic tribes of green men but that among them all was no city that the red men did not shun for without exception they stood amidst vast waterless tracts unsuited for the continued sustenance of the dominant race of martians why then should they be bringing her to such a place there was but a single answer such was the nature of their work that they must needs seek the seclusion that a dead city afforded the girl trembled at thought of her plight for two days her captors kept her within a huge palace that even in decay reflected the splendour of the age which its youth had known just before dawn on the third day she had been aroused by the voices of two of her abductors he should be here by dawn one was saying have her in readiness upon the plaza else he will never land the moment he finds that he is in a strange country he will turn about methinks the prince's plan is weak in this one spot there was no other way replied the other it is wondrous work to get them both here at all and even if we do not succeed in luring him to the ground we shall have accomplished much just then the speaker caught the eyes of thuvia upon him revealed by the quick moving patch of light cast by thuria in her mad race through the heavens with a quick sign to the other he ceased speaking and advancing toward the girl motioned her to rise then he led her out into the night toward the centre of the great plaza stand here he commanded until we come for you we shall be watching and should you attempt to escape it will go ill with you much worse than death such are the prince's orders then he turned and retraced his steps toward the palace leaving her alone in the midst of the unseen terrors of the haunted city for in truth these places are haunted in the belief of many martians who still cling to an ancient superstition which teaches that the spirits of holy therns who die before their allotted one thousand years pass on occasions into the bodies of the great white apes to thuvia however the real danger of attack by one of these ferocious manlike beasts was quite sufficient she no longer believed in the weird soul transmigration that the therns had taught her before she was rescued from their clutches by john carter but she well knew the horrid fate that awaited her should one of the terrible beasts chance to spy her during its nocturnal prowlings what was that surely she could not be mistaken something had moved stealthily in the shadow of one of the great monoliths that line the avenue where it entered the plaza opposite her thar ban jed among the hordes of torquas rode swiftly across the ochre vegetation of the dead sea bottom toward the ruins of ancient aaanthor he had ridden far that night and fast for he had but come from the despoiling of the incubator of a neighbouring green horde with which the hordes of torquas were perpetually warring his giant thoat was far from jaded yet it would be well thought thar ban to permit him to graze upon the ochre moss which grows to greater height within the protected courtyards of deserted cities where the soil is richer than on the sea bottoms and the plants partly shaded from the sun during the cloudless martian day within the tiny stems of this dry seeming plant is sufficient moisture for the needs of the huge bodies of the mighty thoats which can exist for months without water and for days without even the slight moisture which the ochre moss contains as thar ban rode noiselessly up the broad avenue which leads from the quays of aaanthor to the great central plaza he and his mount might have been mistaken for spectres from a world of dreams so grotesque the man and beast so soundless the great thoat's padded nailless feet upon the moss grown flagging of the ancient pavement the man was a splendid specimen of his race fully fifteen feet towered his great height from sole to pate the moonlight glistened against his glossy green hide sparkling the jewels of his heavy harness and the ornaments that weighted his four muscular arms while the upcurving tusks that protruded from his lower jaw gleamed white and terrible at the side of his thoat were slung his long radium rifle and his great forty foot metal shod spear while from his own harness depended his long sword and his short sword as well as his lesser weapons his protruding eyes and antennae like ears were turning constantly hither and thither for thar ban was yet in the country of the enemy and too there was always the menace of the great white apes which john carter was wont to say are the only creatures that can arouse in the breasts of these fierce denizens of the dead sea bottoms even the remotest semblance of fear as the rider neared the plaza he reined suddenly in his slender tubular ears pointed rigidly forward an unwonted sound had reached them voices and where there were voices outside of torquas there too were enemies all the world of wide barsoom contained naught but enemies for the fierce torquasians thar ban dismounted keeping in the shadows of the great monoliths that line the avenue of quays of sleeping aaanthor he approached the plaza directly behind him as a hound at heel came the slate grey thoat his white belly shadowed by his barrel his vivid yellow feet merging into the yellow of the moss beneath them in the centre of the plaza thar ban saw the figure of a red
x 1 the tall one's companions cried with emphasis that they too had evolved the same thing and they congratulated themselves upon it but there were others who said that the tall one's plan was not the true one at all they persisted with other theories there was a vigorous discussion the youth took no part in them as he walked along in careless line he was engaged with his own eternal debate he could not hinder himself from dwelling upon it he was despondent and sullen and threw shifting glances about him he looked ahead often expecting to hear from the advance the rattle of firing but the long serpents crawled slowly from hill to hill without bluster of smoke a dun colored cloud of dust floated away to the right the sky overhead was of a fairy blue the youth studied the faces of his companions ever on the watch to detect kindred emotions he suffered disappointment some ardor of the air which was causing the veteran commands to move with glee almost with song had infected the new regiment the men began to speak of victory as of a thing they knew also the tall soldier received his vindication they were certainly going to come around in behind the enemy they expressed commiseration for that part of the army which had been left upon the river bank felicitating themselves upon being a part of a blasting host the youth considering himself as separated from the others was saddened by the blithe and merry speeches that went from rank to rank the company wags all made their best endeavors the regiment tramped to the tune of laughter the blatant soldier often convulsed whole files by his biting sarcasms aimed at the tall one and it was not long before all the men seemed to forget their mission whole brigades grinned in unison and regiments laughed a rather fat soldier attempted to pilfer a horse from a dooryard he planned to load his knapsack upon it he was escaping with his prize when a young girl rushed from the house and grabbed the animal's mane there followed a wrangle the young girl with pink cheeks and shining eyes stood like a dauntless statue the observant regiment standing at rest in the roadway whooped at once and entered whole souled upon the side of the maiden the men became so engrossed in this affair that they entirely ceased to remember their own large war they jeered the piratical private and called attention to various defects in his personal appearance and they were wildly enthusiastic in support of the young girl to her from some distance came bold advice hit him with a stick there were crows and catcalls showered upon him when he retreated without the horse the regiment rejoiced at his downfall loud and vociferous congratulations were showered upon the maiden who stood panting and regarding the troops with defiance at nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces and the fragments went into the fields to camp tents sprang up like strange plants camp fires like red peculiar blossoms dotted the night the youth kept from intercourse with his companions as much as circumstances would allow him in the evening he wandered a few paces into the gloom from this little distance the many fires with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays made weird and satanic effects he lay down in the grass the blades pressed tenderly against his cheek the moon had been lighted and was hung in a treetop the liquid stillness of the night enveloping him made him feel vast pity for himself there was a caress in the soft winds and the whole mood of the darkness he thought was one of sympathy for himself in his distress he wished without reserve that he was at home again making the endless rounds from the house to the barn from the barn to the fields from the fields to the barn from the barn to the house he remembered he had so often cursed the brindle cow and her mates and had sometimes flung milking stools but from his present point of view there was a halo of happiness about each of their heads and he would have sacrificed all the brass buttons on the continent to have been enabled to return to them he told himself that he was not formed for a soldier and he mused seriously upon the radical differences between himself and those men who were dodging implike around the fires as he mused thus he heard the rustle of grass and upon turning his head discovered the loud soldier he called out oh wilson the latter approached and looked down why hello henry is it you what are you doing here oh thinking said the youth the other sat down and carefully lighted his pipe you're getting blue my boy you're looking thundering peek ed what the dickens is wrong with you oh nothing said the youth the loud soldier launched then into the subject of the anticipated fight oh we've got em now as he spoke his boyish face was wreathed in a gleeful smile and his voice had an exultant ring we've got em now at last by the eternal thunders we'll like em good if the truth was known he added more soberly they've licked _us_ about every clip up to now but this time this time we'll lick em good i thought you was objecting to this march a little while ago said the youth coldly oh it wasn't that explained the other i don't mind marching if there's going to be fighting at the end of it what i hate is this getting moved here and moved there with no good coming of it as far as i can see excepting sore feet and damned short rations well jim conklin says we'll get plenty of fighting this time he's right for once i guess though i can't see how it come this time we're in for a big battle and we've got the best end of it certain sure gee rod how we will thump em he arose and began to pace to and fro excitedly the thrill of his enthusiasm made him walk with an elastic step he was sprightly vigorous fiery in his belief in success he looked into the future with clear proud eye and he swore with the air of an old soldier the youth watched him for a moment in silence when he finally spoke his voice was as bitter as dregs oh you're going to do great things i s'pose the loud soldier blew a thoughtful cloud of smoke from his pipe oh i don't know he remarked with dignity i don't know i s'pose i'll do as well as the rest i'm going to try like thunder he evidently complimented himself upon the modesty of this statement how do you know you won't run when the time comes asked the youth run said the loud one run of course not he laughed well continued the youth lots of good a nough men have thought they was going to do great things before the fight but when the time come they skedaddled oh that's all true i s'pose replied the other but i'm not going to skedaddle the man that bets on my running will lose his money that's all he nodded confidently oh shucks said the youth you ain't the bravest man in the world are you no i ain't exclaimed the loud soldier indignantly and i didn't say i was the bravest man in the world neither i said i was going to do my share of fighting that's what i said and i am too who are you anyhow you talk as if you thought you was napoleon bonaparte he glared at the youth for a moment and then strode away the youth called in a savage voice after his comrade well you needn't git mad about it but the other continued on his way and made no reply he felt alone in space when his injured comrade had disappeared his failure to discover any mite of resemblance in their viewpoints made him more miserable than before no one seemed to be wrestling with such a terrific personal problem he was a mental outcast he went slowly to his tent and stretched himself on a blanket by the side of the snoring tall soldier in the darkness he saw visions of a thousand tongued fear that would babble at his back and cause him to flee while others were going coolly about their country's business he admitted that he would not be able to cope with this monster he felt that every nerve in his body would be an ear to hear the voices while other men would remain stolid and deaf and as he sweated with the pain of these thoughts he could hear low serene sentences i'll bid five make it six seven seven goes he stared at the red shivering reflection of a fire on the white wall of his tent until exhausted and ill from the monotony of his suffering he fell asleep chapter 3 when another night came the columns changed to purple streaks filed across two pontoon bridges a glaring fire wine tinted the waters of the river its rays shining upon the moving masses of troops brought forth here and there sudden gleams of silver or gold upon the other shore a dark and mysterious range of hills was curved against the sky the insect voices of the night sang solemnly after this crossing the youth assured himself that at any moment they might be suddenly and fearfully assaulted from the caves of the lowering woods he kept his eyes watchfully upon the darkness but his regiment went unmolested to a camping place and its soldiers slept the brave sleep of wearied men in the morning they were routed out with early energy and hustled along a narrow road that led deep into the forest it was during this rapid march that the regiment lost many of the marks of a new command the men had begun to count the miles upon their fingers and they grew tired sore feet an damned short rations that's all said the loud soldier there was perspiration and grumblings after a time they began to shed their knapsacks some tossed them unconcernedly down others hid them carefully asserting their plans to return for them at some convenient time men extricated themselves from thick shirts presently few carried anything but their necessary clothing blankets haversacks canteens and arms and ammunition you can now eat and shoot said the tall soldier to the youth that's all you want to do there was sudden change from the ponderous infantry of theory to the light and speedy infantry of practice the regiment relieved of a burden received a new impetus but there was much loss of valuable knapsacks and on the whole very good shirts but the regiment was not yet veteranlike in appearance veteran regiments in the army were likely to be very small aggregations of men once when the command had first come to the field some perambulating veterans noting the length of their column had accosted them thus hey fellers what brigade is that and when the men had replied that they formed a regiment and not a brigade the older soldiers had laughed and said o gawd also there was too great a similarity in the hats the hats of a regiment should properly represent the history of headgear for a period of years and moreover there were no letters of faded gold speaking from the colors they were new and beautiful and the color bearer habitually oiled the pole presently the army again sat down to think the odor of the peaceful pines was in the men's nostrils the sound of monotonous axe blows rang through the forest and the insects nodding upon their perches crooned like old women the youth returned to his theory of a blue demonstration one gray dawn however he was kicked in the leg by the tall soldier and then before he was entirely awake he found himself running down a wood road in the midst of men who were panting from the first effects of speed his canteen banged rythmically upon his thigh and his haversack bobbed softly his musket bounced a trifle from his shoulder at each stride and made his cap feel uncertain upon his head he could hear the men whisper jerky sentences say what's all this about what th thunder we skedaddlin this way fer billie keep off m feet yeh run like a cow and the loud soldier's shrill voice could be heard what th'devil they in sich a hurry for the youth thought the damp fog of early morning moved from the rush of a great body of troops from the distance came a sudden spatter of firing he was bewildered as he ran with his comrades he strenuously tried to think but all he knew was that if he fell down those coming behind would tread upon him all his faculties seemed to be needed to guide him over and past obstructions he felt carried along by a mob the sun spread disclosing rays and one by one regiments burst into view like armed men just born of the earth the youth perceived that the time had come he was about to be measured for a moment he felt in the face of his great trial like a babe and the flesh over his heart seemed very thin he seized time to look about him calculatingly but he instantly saw that it would be impossible for him to escape from the regiment it inclosed him and there were iron laws of tradition and law on four sides he was in a moving box as he perceived this fact it occurred to him that he had never wished to come to the war he had not enlisted of his free will he had been dragged by the merciless government and now they were taking him out to be slaughtered the regiment slid down a bank and wallowed across a little stream the mournful current moved slowly on and from the water shaded black some white bubble eyes looked at the men as they climbed the hill on the farther side artillery began to boom here the youth forgot many things as he felt a sudden impulse of curiosity he scrambled up the bank with a speed that could not be exceeded by a bloodthirsty man he expected a battle scene there were some little fields girted and squeezed by a forest spread over the grass and in among the tree trunks he could see knots and waving lines of skirmishers who were running hither and thither and firing at the landscape a dark battle line lay upon a sunstruck clearing that gleamed orange color a flag fluttered other regiments floundered up the bank the brigade was formed in line of battle and after a pause started slowly through the woods in the rear of the receding skirmishers who were continually melting into the scene to appear again farther on they were always busy as bees deeply absorbed in their little combats the youth tried to observe everything he did not use care to avoid trees and branches and his forgotten feet were constantly knocking against stones or getting entangled in briers he was aware that these battalions with their commotions were woven red and startling into the gentle fabric of softened greens and browns it looked to be a wrong place for a battle field the skirmishers in advance fascinated him their shots into thickets and at distant and prominent trees spoke to him of tragedies hidden mysterious solemn once the line encountered the body of a dead soldier he lay upon his back staring at the sky he was dressed in an awkward suit of yellowish brown the youth could see that the soles of his shoes had been worn to the thinness of writing paper and from a great rent in one the dead foot projected piteously and it was as if fate had betrayed the soldier in death it exposed to his enemies that poverty which in life he had perhaps concealed from his friends the ranks opened covertly to avoid the corpse the invulnerable dead man forced a way for himself the youth looked keenly at the ashen face the wind raised the tawny beard it moved as if a hand were stroking it he vaguely desired to walk around and around the body and stare the impulse of the living to try to read in dead eyes the answer to the question during the march the ardor which the youth had acquired when out of view of the field rapidly faded to nothing his curiosity was quite easily satisfied if an intense scene had caught him with its wild swing as he came to the top of the bank he might have gone gone roaring on this advance upon nature was too calm he had opportunity to reflect he had time in which to wonder about himself and to attempt to probe his sensations absurd ideas took hold upon him he thought that he did not relish the landscape it threatened him a coldness swept over his back and it is true that his trousers felt to him that they were no fit for his legs at all a house standing placidly in distant fields had to him an ominous look the shadows of the woods were formidable he was certain that in this vista there lurked fierce eyed hosts the swift thought came to him that the generals did not know what they were about it was all a trap suddenly those close forests would bristle with rifle barrels ironlike brigades would appear in the rear they were all going to be sacrificed the generals were stupids the enemy would presently swallow the whole command he glared about him expecting to see the stealthy approach of his death he thought that he must break from the ranks and harangue his comrades they must not all be killed like pigs and he was sure it would come to pass unless they were informed of these dangers the generals were idiots to send them marching into a regular pen there was but one pair of eyes in the corps he would step forth and make a speech shrill and passionate words came to his lips the line broken into moving fragments by the ground went calmly on through fields and woods the youth looked at the men nearest him and saw for the most part expressions of deep interest as if they were investigating something that had fascinated them one or two stepped with overvaliant airs as if they were already plunged into war others walked as upon thin ice the greater part of the untested men appeared quiet and absorbed they were going to look at war the red animal war the blood swollen god and they were deeply engrossed in this march as he looked the youth gripped his outcry at his throat he saw that even if the men were tottering with fear they would laugh at his warning they would jeer him and if practicable pelt him with missiles admitting that he might be wrong a frenzied declamation of the kind would turn him into a worm he assumed then the demeanor of one who knows that he is doomed alone to unwritten responsibilities he lagged with tragic glances at the sky he was surprised presently by the young lieutenant of his company who began heartily to beat him with a sword calling out in a loud and insolent voice come young man get up into ranks there no skulking ll do here he mended his pace with suitable haste and he hated the lieutenant who had no appreciation of fine minds he was a mere brute after a time the brigade was halted in the cathedral light of a forest the busy skirmishers were still popping through the aisles of the wood could be seen the floating smoke from their rifles sometimes it went up in little balls white and compact during this halt many men in the regiment began erecting tiny hills in front of them they used stones sticks earth and anything they thought might turn a bullet some built comparatively large ones while others seems content with little ones this procedure caused a discussion among the men some wished to fight like duelists believing it to be correct to stand erect and be from their feet to their foreheads a mark they said they scorned the devices of the cautious but the others scoffed in reply and pointed to the veterans on the flanks who were digging at the ground like terriers in a short time there was quite a barricade along the regimental fronts directly however they were ordered to withdraw from that place this astounded the youth he forgot his stewing over the advance movement well then what did they march us out here for he demanded of the tall soldier the latter with calm faith began a heavy explanation although he had been compelled to leave a little protection of stones and dirt to which he had devoted much care and skill when the regiment was aligned in another position each man's regard for his safety caused another line of small intrenchments they ate their noon meal behind a third one they were moved from this one also they were marched from place to place with apparent aimlessness the youth had been taught that a man became another thing in battle he saw his salvation in such a change hence this waiting was an ordeal to him he was in a fever of impatience he considered that there was denoted a lack of purpose on the part of the generals he began to complain to the tall soldier i can't stand this much longer he cried i don't see what good it does to make us wear out our legs for nothin he wished to return to camp knowing that this affair was a blue demonstration or else to go into a battle and discover that he had been a fool in his doubts and was in truth a man of traditional courage the strain of present circumstances he felt to be intolerable the philosophical tall soldier measured a sandwich of cracker and pork and swallowed it in a nonchalant manner oh i suppose we must go reconnoitering around the country jest to keep em from getting too close or to develop em or something huh said the loud soldier well cried the youth still fidgeting i'd rather do anything most than go tramping round the country all day doing no good to nobody and jest tiring ourselves out so would i said the loud soldier it ain't right i tell you if anybody with any sense was a runnin this army it oh shut up roared the tall private you little fool you little damn cuss you ain't had that there coat and them pants on for six months and yet you talk as if well i wanta do some fighting anyway interrupted the other i didn't come here to walk i could ave walked to home round an round the barn if i jest wanted to walk the tall one red faced swallowed another sandwich as if taking poison in despair but gradually as he chewed his face became again quiet and contented he could not rage in fierce argument in the presence of such sandwiches during his meals he always wore an air of blissful contemplation of the food he had swallowed his spirit seemed then to be communing with the viands he accepted new environment and circumstance with great coolness eating from his haversack at every opportunity on the march he went along with the stride of a hunter objecting to neither gait nor distance and he had not raised his voice when he had been ordered away from three little protective piles of earth and stone each of which had been an engineering feat worthy of being made sacred to the name of his grandmother in the afternoon the regiment went out over the same ground it had taken in the morning the landscape then ceased to threaten the youth he had been close to it and become familiar with it when however they began to pass into a new region his old fears of stupidity and incompetence reassailed him but this time he doggedly let them babble he was occupied with his problem and in his desperation he concluded that the stupidity did not greatly matter once he thought he had concluded that it would be better to get killed directly and end his troubles regarding death thus out of the corner of his eye he conceived it to be nothing but rest and he was filled with a momentary astonishment that he should have made an extraordinary commotion over the mere matter of getting killed he would die he would go to some place where he would be understood it was useless to expect appreciation of his profound and fine sense from such men as the lieutenant he must look to the grave for comprehension the skirmish fire increased to a long clattering sound with it was mingled far away cheering a battery spoke directly the youth could see the skirmishers running they were pursued by the sound of musketry fire after a time the hot dangerous flashes of the rifles were visible smoke clouds went slowly and insolently across the fields like observant phantoms the din became crescendo like the roar of an oncoming train a brigade ahead of them and on the right went into action with a rending roar it was as if it had exploded and thereafter it lay stretched in the distance behind a long gray wall that one was obliged to look twice at to make sure that it was smoke the youth forgetting his neat plan of getting killed gazed spell bound his eyes grew wide and busy with the action of the scene his mouth was a little ways open of a sudden he felt a heavy and sad hand laid upon his shoulder awakening from his trance of observation he turned and beheld the loud soldier it's my first and last battle old boy said the latter with intense gloom he was quite pale and his girlish lip was trembling eh murmured the youth in great astonishment it's my first and last battle old boy continued the loud soldier something tells me what i'm a gone coon this first time and and i w want you to take these here things to my folks he ended in a quavering sob of pity for himself he handed the youth a little packet done up in a yellow envelope why what the devil began the youth again but the other gave him a glance as from the depths of a tomb and raised his limp hand in a prophetic manner and turned away chapter 4 the brigade was halted in the fringe of a grove the men crouched among the trees and pointed their restless guns out at the fields they tried to look beyond the smoke out of this haze they could see running men some shouted information and gestured as the hurried the men of the new regiment watched and listened eagerly while their tongues ran on in gossip of the battle they mouthed rumors that had flown like birds out of the unknown they say perry has been driven in with big loss yes carrott went t th hospital he said he was sick that smart lieutenant is commanding g company th boys say they won't be under carrott no more if they all have t desert they allus knew he was a hannises batt'ry is took it ain't either i saw hannises batt'ry off on th left not more'n

of th fight three fingers was crunched th dern doctor wanted t amputate m an bill he raised a heluva row i hear he's a funny feller the din in front swelled to a tremendous chorus the youth and his fellows were frozen to silence they could see a flag that tossed in the smoke angrily near it were the blurred and agitated forms of troops there
x 1 heart and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in the sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by dangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of more innocents there was no lack of material boys happened along every little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash by the time ben was fagged out tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for a kite in good repair and when he played out johnny miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with and so on and so on hour after hour and when the middle of the afternoon came from being a poor poverty stricken boy in the morning tom was literally rolling in wealth he had besides the things before mentioned twelve marbles part of a jews harp a piece of blue bottle glass to look through a spool cannon a key that wouldn't unlock anything a fragment of chalk a glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles six fire crackers a kitten with only one eye a brass door knob a dog collar but no dog the handle of a knife four pieces of orange peel and a dilapidated old window sash he had had a nice good idle time all the while plenty of company and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it if he hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all he had discovered a great law of human action without knowing it namely that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain if he had been a great and wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do and this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread mill is work while rolling ten pins or climbing mont blanc is only amusement there are wealthy gentlemen in england who drive four horse passenger coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable money but if they were offered wages for the service that would turn it into work and then they would resign the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters to report chapter iii tom presented himself before aunt polly who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroom breakfast room dining room and library combined the balmy summer air the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her knitting for she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her lap her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety she had thought that of course tom had deserted long ago and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way he said mayn't i go and play now aunt what a'ready how much have you done it's all done aunt tom don't lie to me i can't bear it i ain't aunt it _is_ all done aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence she went out to see for herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent of tom's statement true when she found the entire fence white washed and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and even a streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable she said well i never there's no getting round it you can work when you're a mind to tom and then she diluted the compliment by adding but it's powerful seldom you're a mind to i'm bound to say well go long and play but mind you get back some time in a week or i'll tan you she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish he hooked a doughnut then he skipped out and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling they raged around sid like a hail storm and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect and tom was over the fence and gone there was a gate but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it his soul was at peace now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt's cow stable he presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square of the village where two military companies of boys had met for conflict according to previous appointment tom was general of one of these armies joe harper a bosom friend general of the other these two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person that being better suited to the still smaller fry but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides de camp tom's army won a great victory after a long and hard fought battle then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and marched away and tom turned homeward alone as he was passing by the house where jeff thatcher lived he saw a new girl in the garden a lovely little blue eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long tails white summer frock and embroidered pan talettes the fresh crowned hero fell without firing a shot a certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind he had thought he loved her to distraction he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality he had been months winning her she had confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that she had discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present and began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order to win her admiration he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time but by and by while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house tom came up to the fence and leaned on it grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer she halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold but his face lit up right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to side in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finally his bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner but only for a minute only while he could button the flower inside his jacket next his heart or next his stomach possibly for he was not much posted in anatomy and not hypercritical anyway he returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window meantime and been aware of his attentions finally he strode home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered what had got into the child he took a good scolding about clodding sid and did not seem to mind it in the least he tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it he said aunt you don't whack sid when he takes it well sid don't torment a body the way you do you'd be always into that sugar if i warn't watching you presently she stepped into the kitchen and sid happy in his immunity reached for the sugar bowl a sort of glorying over tom which was wellnigh unbearable but sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke tom was in ecstasies in such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent he said to himself that he would not speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model catch it he was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles he said to himself now it's coming and the next instant he was sprawling on the floor the potent palm was uplifted to strike again when tom cried out hold on now what er you belting _me_ for sid broke it aunt polly paused perplexed and tom looked for healing pity but when she got her tongue again she only said umf well you didn't get a lick amiss i reckon you been into some other audacious mischief when i wasn't around like enough then her conscience reproached her and she yearned to say something kind and loving but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong and discipline forbade that so she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes he knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it he would hang out no signals he would take notice of none he knew that a yearning glance fell upon him now and then through a film of tears but he refused recognition of it he pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word but he would turn his face to the wall and die with that word unsaid ah how would she feel then and he pictured himself brought home from the river dead with his curls all wet and his sore heart at rest how she would throw herself upon him and how her tears would fall like rain and her lips pray god to give her back her boy and she would never never abuse him any more but he would lie there cold and white and make no sign a poor little sufferer whose griefs were at an end he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams that he had to keep swallowing he was so like to choke and his eyes swam in a blur of water which overflowed when he winked and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose and such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it it was too sacred for such contact and so presently when his cousin mary danced in all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age long visit of one week to the country he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit a log raft in the river invited him and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream wishing the while that he could only be drowned all at once and unconsciously without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature then he thought of his flower he got it out rumpled and wilted and it mightily increased his dismal felicity he wondered if she would pity him if she knew would she cry and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights till he wore it threadbare at last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness about half past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to where the adored unknown lived he paused a moment no sound fell upon his listening ear a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second story window was the sacred presence there he climbed the fence threaded his stealthy way through the plants till he stood under that window he looked up at it long and with emotion then he laid him down on the ground under it disposing himself upon his back with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower and thus he would die out in the cold world with no shelter over his homeless head no friendly hand to wipe the death damps from his brow no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came and thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning and oh would she drop one little tear upon his poor lifeless form would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted so untimely cut down the window went up a maid servant's discordant voice profaned the holy calm and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort there was a whiz as of a missile in the air mingled with the murmur of a curse a sound as of shivering glass followed and a small vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom not long after as tom all undressed for bed was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip sid woke up but if he had any dim idea of making any references to allusions he thought better of it and held his peace for there was danger in tom's eye tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers and sid made mental note of the omission chapter iv the sun rose upon a tranquil world and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction breakfast over aunt polly had family worship it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of scriptural quotations welded together with a thin mortar of originality and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the mosaic law as from sinai then tom girded up his loins so to speak and went to work to get his verses sid had learned his lesson days before tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses and he chose part of the sermon on the mount because he could find no verses that were shorter at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson but no more for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought and his hands were busy with distracting recreations mary took his book to hear him recite and he tried to find his way through the fog blessed are the a a poor yes poor blessed are the poor a a in spirit in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for they they _theirs_ for _theirs_ blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they they sh for they a s h a for they s h oh i don't know what it is _shall_ oh _shall_ for they shall for they shall a a shall mourn a a blessed are they that shall they that a they that shall mourn for they shall a shall _what_ why don't you tell me mary what do you want to be so mean for oh tom you poor thick headed thing i'm not teasing you i wouldn't do that you must go and learn it again don't you be discouraged tom you'll manage it and if you do i'll give you something ever so nice there now that's a good boy all right what is it mary tell me what it is never you mind tom you know if i say it's nice it is nice you bet you that's so mary all right i'll tackle it again and he did tackle it again and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success mary gave him a brand new barlow knife worth twelve and a half cents and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations true the knife would not cut anything but it was a sure enough barlow and there was inconceivable grandeur in that though where the western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so perhaps tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it and was arranging to begin on the bureau when he was called off to dress for sunday school mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleeves poured out the water on the ground gently and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door but mary removed the towel and said now ain't you ashamed tom you mustn't be so bad water won't hurt you tom was a trifle disconcerted the basin was refilled and this time he stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a big breath and began when he entered the kitchen presently with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face but when he emerged from the towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck mary took him in hand and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother without distinction of color and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect he privately smoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered his hair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate and his own filled his life with bitterness then mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years they were simply called his other clothes and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe the girl put him to rights after he had dressed himself she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat he now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him he hoped that mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted she coated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought them out he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn't want to do but mary said persuasively please tom that's a good boy so he got into the shoes snarling mary was soon ready and the three children set out for sunday school a place that tom hated with his whole heart but sid and mary were fond of it sabbath school hours were from nine to half past ten and then church service two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily and the other always remained too for stronger reasons the church's high backed uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sort of pine board tree box on top of it for a steeple at the door tom dropped back a step and accosted a sunday dressed comrade say billy got a yaller ticket yes what'll you take for her what'll you give piece of lickrish and a fish hook less see em tom exhibited they were satisfactory and the property changed hands then tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones he waylaid other boys as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer he entered the church now with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy the teacher a grave elderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and tom pulled a boy's hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hear him say ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher tom's whole class were of a pattern restless noisy and troublesome when they came to recite their lessons not one of them knew his verses perfectly but had to be prompted all along however they worried through and each got his reward in small blue tickets each with a passage of scripture on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation ten blue tickets equalled a red one and could be exchanged for it ten red tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound bible worth forty cents in those easy times to the pupil how many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses even for a dore bible and yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way it was the patient work of two years and a boy of german parentage had won four or five he once recited three thousand verses without stopping but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth a grievous misfortune for the school for on great occasions before company the superintendent as tom expressed it had always made this boy come out and spread himself only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a bible and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks it is possible that tom's mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit with a closed hymn book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves and commanded attention when a sunday school superintendent makes his customary little speech a hymn book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert though why is a mystery for neither the hymn book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer this superintendent was a slim creature of thirty five with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair he wore a stiff standing collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank note and had fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in the fashion of the day like sleigh runners an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together mr walters was very earnest of mien and very sincere and honest at heart and he held sacred things and places in such reverence and so separated them from worldly matters that unconsciously to himself his sunday school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week days he began after this fashion now children i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two there that is it that is the way good little boys and girls should do i see one little girl who is looking out of the window i am afraid she thinks i am out there somewhere perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds applausive titter i want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright clean little faces assembled in a place like this learning to do right and be good and so forth and so on it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration it was of a pattern which does not vary and so it is familiar to us all the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary but now every sound ceased suddenly with the subsidence of mr walters voice and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare the entrance of visitors lawyer thatcher accompanied by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middle aged gentleman with iron gray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife the lady was leading a child tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings conscience smitten too he could not meet amy lawrence's eye he could not brook her loving gaze but when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment the next moment he was showing off with all his might cuffing boys pulling hair making faces in a word using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause his exaltation had but one alloy the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden and that record in sand was fast washing out under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now the visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as mr walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school the middle aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage no less a one than the county judge altogether the
x 1 cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didn't want to be a robber any more so they all made fun of him and called him cry baby and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets but tom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people ben rogers said he couldn't get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was dog tired chapter iii well i got a good going over in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes but the widow she didn't scold but only cleaned off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed but nothing come of it she told me to pray every day and whatever i asked for i would get it but it warn't so i tried it once i got a fish line but no hooks it warn't any good to me without hooks i tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow i couldn't make it work by and by one day i asked miss watson to try for me but she said i was a fool she never told me why and i couldn't make it out no way i set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it i says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why don't deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole why can't miss watson fat up no says i to my self there ain't nothing in it i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts this was too many for me but she told me what she meant i must help other people and do everything i could for other people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself this was including miss watson as i took it i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldn't see no advantage about it except for the other people so at last i reckoned i wouldn't worry about it any more but just let it go sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a body's mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again i judged i could see that there was two providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's providence but if miss watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more i thought it all out and reckoned i would belong to the widow's if he wanted me though i couldn't make out how he was a going to be any better off then than what he was before seeing i was so ignorant and so kind of low down and ornery pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable for me i didn't want to see him no more he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around well about this time he was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people said they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like pap but they couldn't make nothing out of the face because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all they said he was floating on his back in the water they took him and buried him on the bank but i warn't comfortable long because i happened to think of something i knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back but on his face so i knowed then that this warn't pap but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes so i was uncomfortable again i judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished he wouldn't we played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned all the boys did we hadn't robbed nobody hadn't killed any people but only just pretended we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but we never hived any of them tom sawyer called the hogs ingots and he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked but i couldn't see no profit in it one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich a rabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter mules all loaded down with di'monds and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called it and kill the lot and scoop the things he said we must slick up our swords and guns and get ready he never could go after even a turnip cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them till you rotted and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before i didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and a rabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephants so i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill but there warn't no spaniards and a rabs and there warn't no camels nor no elephants it warn't anything but a sunday school picnic and only a primer class at that we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymn book and a tract and then the teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut i didn't see no di'monds and i told tom sawyer so he said there was loads of them there anyway and he said there was a rabs there too and elephants and things i said why couldn't we see them then he said if i warn't so ignorant but had read a book called don quixote i would know without asking he said it was all done by enchantment he said there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sunday school just out of spite i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians tom sawyer said i was a numskull why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well i says s'pose we got some genies to help _us_ can't we lick the other crowd then how you going to get them i don't know how do _they_ get them why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come tearing in with the thunder and lightning a ripping around and the smoke a rolling and everything they're told to do they up and do it they don't think nothing of pulling a shot tower up by the roots and belting a sunday school superintendent over the head with it or any other man who makes them tear around so why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring and they've got to do whatever he says if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds and fill it full of chewing gum or whatever you want and fetch an emperor's daughter from china for you to marry they've got to do it and they've got to do it before sun up next morning too and more they've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand well says i i think they are a pack of flat heads for not keeping the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that and what's more if i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp how you talk huck finn why you'd _have_ to come when he rubbed it whether you wanted to or not what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church all right then i _would_ come but i lay i'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country shucks it ain't no use to talk to you huck finn you don't seem to know anything somehow perfect saphead i thought all this over for two or three days and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warn't no use none of the genies come so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of tom sawyer's lies i reckoned he believed in the a rabs and the elephants but as for me i think different it had all the marks of a sunday school chapter iv well three or four months run along and it was well into the winter now i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty five and i don't reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever i don't take no stock in mathematics anyway at first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand it whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be i was getting sort of used to the widow's ways too and they warn't so raspy on me living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to me i liked the old ways best but i was getting so i liked the new ones too a little bit the widow said i was coming along slow but sure and doing very satisfactory she said she warn't ashamed of me one morning i happened to turn over the salt cellar at breakfast i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of me and crossed me off she says take your hands away huckleberry what a mess you are always making the widow put in a good word for me but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough i started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasn't one of them kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked along low spirited and on the watch out i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence there was an inch of new snow on the ground and i seen somebody's tracks they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden fence it was funny they hadn't come in after standing around so i couldn't make it out it was very curious somehow i was going to follow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first i didn't notice anything at first but next i did there was a cross in the left boot heel made with big nails to keep off the devil i was up in a second and shinning down the hill i looked over my shoulder every now and then but i didn't see nobody i was at judge thatcher's as quick as i could get there he said why my boy you are all out of breath did you come for your interest no sir i says is there some for me oh yes a half yearly is in last night over a hundred and fifty dollars quite a fortune for you you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand because if you take it you'll spend it no sir i says i don't want to spend it i don't want it at all nor the six thousand nuther i want you to take it i want to give it to you the six thousand and all he looked surprised he couldn't seem to make it out he says why what can you mean my boy i says don't you ask me no questions about it please you'll take it won't you he says well i'm puzzled is something the matter please take it says i and don't ask me nothing then i won't have to tell no lies he studied a while and then he says oho o i think i see you want to _sell_ all your property to me not give it that's the correct idea then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says there you see it says for a consideration that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it here's a dollar for you now you sign it so i signed it and left miss watson's nigger jim had a hair ball as big as your fist which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic with it he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed everything so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again for i found his tracks in the snow what i wanted to know was what he was going to do and was he going to stay jim got out his hair ball and said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch jim tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened but it warn't no use he said it wouldn't talk he said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little and it wouldn't pass nohow even if the brass didn't show because it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time i reckoned i wouldn't say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge i said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hair ball would take it because maybe it wouldn't know the difference jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hair ball would think it was good he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you couldn't see no brass and it wouldn't feel greasy no more and so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hair ball well i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot it jim put the quarter under the hair ball and got down and listened again this time he said the hair ball was all right he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to i says go on so the hair ball talked to jim and jim told it to me he says yo ole father doan know yit what he's a gwyne to do sometimes he spec he'll go way en den agin he spec he'll stay de bes way is to res easy en let de ole man take his own way dey's two angels hoverin roun bout him one uv em is white en shiny en t'other one is black de

it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung when i lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self chapter v i had shut the door to then i turned around and there he was i used to be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much i reckoned i was scared now too but in a minute i see i was mistaken that is after the first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so unexpected but right away after i see i warn't scared of him worth bothring about he was most fifty and he looked it his hair was long and tangled and greasy and hung down and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines it was all black no gray so was his long mixed up whiskers there warn't no color in his face where his face showed it was white not like another man's white but a white to make a body sick a white to make a body's flesh crawl a tree toad white a fish belly white as for his clothes just rags that was all he had one ankle resting on t'other knee the boot on that foot was busted and two of his toes stuck through and he worked them now and then his hat was laying on the floor an old black slouch with the top caved in like a lid i stood a looking at him he set there a looking at me with his chair tilted back a little i set the candle down i noticed the window was up so he had clumb in by the shed he kept a looking me all over by and by he says starchy clothes very you think you're a good deal of a big bug _don't_ you maybe i am maybe i ain't i says don't you give me none o your lip says he you've put on considerable many

general washington and the wars when i'd read about a half a minute he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house he says it's so you can do it i had my doubts when you told me now looky here you stop that putting on frills i won't have it i'll lay for you my smarty and if i catch you about that school i'll tan you good first you know you'll get religion too i never see such a son he took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy and says what's this it's something they give me for learning my lessons good he tore it up and says i'll give you something better i'll give you a cowhide he set there a mumbling and a growling a minute and then he says _ain't_ you a sweet scented dandy though a bed and bedclothes and a look'n glass and a piece of carpet on the floor and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard i never see such a son i bet i'll take some o these frills out o you before i'm done with you why there ain't no end to your airs they say you're rich hey how's that they lie that's how looky here mind how you talk to me i'm a standing about all i can stand now so don't gimme no sass i've been in town two days

say how much you got in your pocket i want it i hain't got only a dollar and i want that to it don't make no difference what you want it for you just shell it out he took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky said he hadn't had a drink all day when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when i reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told me to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i didn't drop that next day he was drunk and he went to judge thatcher's and bullyragged him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldn't and then he swore he'd make the law force him the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had just come and he didn't know the old man so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it said he'd druther not take a child away from its father so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business that pleased the old man till he couldn't rest he said he'd cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didn't raise some money for him i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher and pap took it and got drunk and went a blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed him again for a week but he said _he_ was satisfied said he was boss of his son and he'd make it warm for _him_ when he got out the new judge said he was a going to make a man of him so he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just old pie to him so to speak and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried and said he'd been a fool and fooled away his life but now he was a going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him the judge said he could hug him for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said he believed it the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says look at it gentlemen and ladies all take a hold of it shake it there's a hand that was the hand of a hog but it ain't so no more it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life and'll die before he'll go back you mark them words don't forget i said them it's a clean hand now shake it don't be afeard so they shook it one after the other all around and cried the judge's wife she kissed it then the old man he signed a pledge made his mark the judge said it was the holiest time on record or something like that then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty rod and clumb back again and had a good old time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun up and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it the judge he felt kind of sore he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didn't know no other way chapter vi well pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he went for me too for not stopping school he catched
x 1 gables pointed sharply towards the sky and presented the aspect of a whole sisterhood of edifices breathing through the spiracles of one great chimney the many lattices with their small diamond shaped panes admitted the sunlight into hall and chamber while nevertheless the second story projecting far over the base and itself retiring beneath the third threw a shadowy and thoughtful gloom into the lower rooms carved globes of wood were affixed under the jutting stories little spiral rods of iron beautified each of the seven peaks on the triangular portion of the gable that fronted next the street was a dial put up that very morning and on which the sun was still marking the passage of the first bright hour in a history that was not destined to be all so bright all around were scattered shavings chips shingles and broken halves of bricks these together with the lately turned earth on which the grass had not begun to grow contributed to the impression of strangeness and novelty proper to a house that had yet its place to make among men's daily interests the principal entrance which had almost the breadth of a church door was in the angle between the two front gables and was covered by an open porch with benches beneath its shelter under this arched doorway scraping their feet on the unworn threshold now trod the clergymen the elders the magistrates the deacons and whatever of aristocracy there was in town or county thither too thronged the plebeian classes as freely as their betters and in larger number just within the entrance however stood two serving men pointing some of the guests to the neighborhood of the kitchen and ushering others into the statelier rooms hospitable alike to all but still with a scrutinizing regard to the high or low degree of each velvet garments sombre but rich stiffly plaited ruffs and bands embroidered gloves venerable beards the mien and countenance of authority made it easy to distinguish the gentleman of worship at that period from the tradesman with his plodding air or the laborer in his leathern jerkin stealing awe stricken into the house which he had perhaps helped to build one inauspicious circumstance there was which awakened a hardly concealed displeasure in the breasts of a few of the more punctilious visitors the founder of this stately mansion a gentleman noted for the square and ponderous courtesy of his demeanor ought surely to have stood in his own hall and to have offered the first welcome to so many eminent personages as here presented themselves in honor of his solemn festival he was as yet invisible the most favored of the guests had not beheld him this sluggishness on colonel pyncheon's part became still more unaccountable when the second dignitary of the province made his appearance and found no more ceremonious a reception the lieutenant governor although his visit was one of the anticipated glories of the day had alighted from his horse and assisted his lady from her side saddle and crossed the colonel's threshold without other greeting than that of the principal domestic this person a gray headed man of quiet and most respectful deportment found it necessary to explain that his master still remained in his study or private apartment on entering which an hour before he had expressed a wish on no account to be disturbed do not you see fellow said the high sheriff of the county taking the servant aside that this is no less a man than the lieutenant governor summon colonel pyncheon at once i know that he received letters from england this morning and in the perusal and consideration of them an hour may have passed away without his noticing it but he will be ill pleased i judge if you suffer him to neglect the courtesy due to one of our chief rulers and who may be said to represent king william in the absence of the governor himself call your master instantly nay please your worship answered the man in much perplexity but with a backwardness that strikingly indicated the hard and severe character of colonel pyncheon's domestic rule my master's orders were exceeding strict and as your worship knows he permits of no discretion in the obedience of those who owe him service let who list open yonder door i dare not though the governor's own voice should bid me do it pooh pooh master high sheriff cried the lieutenant governor who had overheard the foregoing discussion and felt himself high enough in station to play a little with his dignity i will take the matter into my own hands it is time that the good colonel came forth to greet his friends else we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken a sip too much of his canary wine in his extreme deliberation which cask it were best to broach in honor of the day but since he is so much behindhand i will give him a remembrancer myself accordingly with such a tramp of his ponderous riding boots as might of itself have been audible in the remotest of the seven gables he advanced to the door which the servant pointed out and made its new panels reecho with a loud free knock then looking round with a smile to the spectators he awaited a response as none came however he knocked again but with the same unsatisfactory result as at first and now being a trifle choleric in his temperament the lieutenant governor uplifted the heavy hilt of his sword wherewith he so beat and banged upon the door that as some of the bystanders whispered the racket might have disturbed the dead be that as it might it seemed to produce no awakening effect on colonel pyncheon when the sound subsided the silence through the house was deep dreary and oppressive notwithstanding that the tongues of many of the guests had already been loosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine or spirits strange forsooth very strange cried the lieutenant governor whose smile was changed to a frown but seeing that our host sets us the good example of forgetting ceremony i shall likewise throw it aside and make free to intrude on his privacy he tried the door which yielded to his hand and was flung wide open by a sudden gust of wind that passed as with a loud sigh from the outermost portal through all the passages and apartments of the new house it rustled the silken garments of the ladies and waved the long curls of the gentlemen's wigs and shook the window hangings and the curtains of the bedchambers causing everywhere a singular stir which yet was more like a hush a shadow of awe and half fearful anticipation nobody knew wherefore nor of what had all at once fallen over the company they thronged however to the now open door pressing the lieutenant governor in the eagerness of their curiosity into the room in advance of them at the first glimpse they beheld nothing extraordinary a handsomely furnished room of moderate size somewhat darkened by curtains books arranged on shelves a large map on the wall and likewise a portrait of colonel pyncheon beneath which sat the original colonel himself in an oaken elbow chair with a pen in his hand letters parchments and blank sheets of paper were on the table before him he appeared to gaze at the curious crowd in front of which stood the lieutenant governor and there was a frown on his dark and massive countenance as if sternly resentful of the boldness that had impelled them into his private retirement a little boy the colonel's grandchild and the only human being that ever dared to be familiar with him now made his way among the guests and ran towards the seated figure then pausing halfway he began to shriek with terror the company tremulous as the leaves of a tree when all are shaking together drew nearer and perceived that there was an unnatural distortion in the fixedness of colonel pyncheon's stare that there was blood on his ruff and that his hoary beard was saturated with it it was too late to give assistance the iron hearted puritan the relentless persecutor the grasping and strong willed man was dead dead in his new house there is a tradition only worth alluding to as lending a tinge of superstitious awe to a scene perhaps gloomy enough without it that a voice spoke loudly among the guests the tones of which were like those of old matthew maule the executed wizard god hath given him blood to drink thus early had that one guest the only guest who is certain at one time or another to find his way into every human dwelling thus early had death stepped across the threshold of the house of the seven gables colonel pyncheon's sudden and mysterious end made a vast deal of noise in its day there were many rumors some of which have vaguely drifted down to the present time how that appearances indicated violence that there were the marks of fingers on his throat and the print of a bloody hand on his plaited ruff and that his peaked beard was dishevelled as if it had been fiercely clutched and pulled it was averred likewise that the lattice window near the colonel's chair was open and that only a few minutes before the fatal occurrence the figure of a man had been seen clambering over the garden fence in the rear of the house but it were folly to lay any stress on stories of this kind which are sure to spring up around such an event as that now related and which as in the present case sometimes prolong themselves for ages afterwards like the toadstools that indicate where the fallen and buried trunk of a tree has long since mouldered into the earth for our own part we allow them just as little credence as to that other fable of the skeleton hand which the lieutenant governor was said to have seen at the colonel's throat but which vanished away as he advanced farther into the room certain it is however that there was a great consultation and dispute of doctors over the dead body one john swinnerton by name who appears to have been a man of eminence upheld it if we have rightly understood his terms of art to be a case of apoplexy his professional brethren each for himself adopted various hypotheses more or less plausible but all dressed out in a perplexing mystery of phrase which if it do not show a bewilderment of mind in these erudite physicians certainly causes it in the unlearned peruser of their opinions the coroner's jury sat upon the corpse and like sensible men returned an unassailable verdict of sudden death it is indeed difficult to imagine that there could have been a serious suspicion of murder or the slightest grounds for implicating any particular individual as the perpetrator the rank wealth and eminent character of the deceased must have insured the strictest scrutiny into every ambiguous circumstance as none such is on record it is safe to assume that none existed tradition which sometimes brings down truth that history has let slip but is oftener the wild babble of the time such as was formerly spoken at the fireside and now congeals in newspapers tradition is responsible for all contrary averments in colonel pyncheon's funeral sermon which was printed and is still extant the rev mr higginson enumerates among the many felicities of his distinguished parishioner's earthly career the happy seasonableness of his death his duties all performed the highest prosperity attained his race and future generations fixed on a stable basis and with a stately roof to shelter them for centuries to come what other upward step remained for this good man to take save the final step from earth to the golden gate of heaven the pious clergyman surely would not have uttered words like these had he in the least suspected that the colonel had been thrust into the other world with the clutch of violence upon his throat the family of colonel pyncheon at the epoch of his death seemed destined to as fortunate a permanence as can anywise consist with the inherent instability of human affairs it might fairly be anticipated that the progress of time would rather increase and ripen their prosperity than wear away and destroy it for not only had his son and heir come into immediate enjoyment of a rich estate but there was a claim through an indian deed confirmed by a subsequent grant of the general court to a vast and as yet unexplored and unmeasured tract of eastern lands these possessions for as such they might almost certainly be reckoned comprised the greater part of what is now known as waldo county in the state of maine and were more extensive than many a dukedom or even a reigning prince's territory on european soil when the pathless forest that still covered this wild principality should give place as it inevitably must though perhaps not till ages hence to the golden fertility of human culture it would be the source of incalculable wealth to the pyncheon blood had the colonel survived only a few weeks longer it is probable that his great political influence and powerful connections at home and abroad would have consummated all that was necessary to render the claim available but in spite of good mr higginson's congratulatory eloquence this appeared to be the one thing which colonel pyncheon provident and sagacious as he was had allowed to go at loose ends so far as the prospective territory was concerned he unquestionably died too soon his son lacked not merely the father's eminent position but the talent and force of character to achieve it he could therefore effect nothing by dint of political interest and the bare justice or legality of the claim was not so apparent after the colonel's decease as it had been pronounced in his lifetime some connecting link had slipped out of the evidence and could not anywhere be found efforts it is true were made by the pyncheons not only then but at various periods for nearly a hundred years afterwards to obtain what they stubbornly persisted in deeming their right but in course of time the territory was partly regranted to more favored individuals and partly cleared and occupied by actual settlers these last if they ever heard of the pyncheon title would have laughed at the idea of any man's asserting a right on the strength of mouldy parchments signed with the faded autographs of governors and legislators long dead and forgotten to the lands which they or their fathers had wrested from the wild hand of nature by their own sturdy toil this impalpable claim therefore resulted in nothing more solid than to cherish from generation to generation an absurd delusion of family importance which all along characterized the pyncheons it caused the poorest member of the race to feel as if he inherited a kind of nobility and might yet come into the possession of princely wealth to support it in the better specimens of the breed this peculiarity threw an ideal grace over the hard material of human life without stealing away any truly valuable quality in the baser sort its effect was to increase the liability to sluggishness and dependence and induce the victim of a shadowy hope to remit all self effort while awaiting the realization of his dreams years and years after their claim had passed out of the public memory the pyncheons were accustomed to consult the colonel's ancient map which had been projected while waldo county was still an unbroken wilderness where the old land surveyor had put down woods lakes and rivers they marked out the cleared spaces and dotted the villages and towns and calculated the progressively increasing value of the territory as if there were yet a prospect of its ultimately forming a princedom for themselves in almost every generation nevertheless there happened to be some one descendant of the family gifted with a portion of the hard keen sense and practical energy that had so remarkably distinguished the original founder his character indeed might be traced all the way down as distinctly as if the colonel himself a little diluted had been gifted with a sort of intermittent immortality on earth at two or three epochs when the fortunes of the family were low this representative of hereditary qualities had made his appearance and caused the traditionary gossips of the town to whisper among themselves here is the old pyncheon come again now the seven gables will be new shingled from father to son they clung to the ancestral house with singular tenacity of home attachment for various reasons however and from impressions often too vaguely founded to be put on paper the writer cherishes the belief that many if not most of the successive proprietors of this estate were troubled with doubts as to their moral right to hold it of their legal tenure there could be no question but old matthew maule it is to be feared trode downward from his own age to a far later one planting a heavy footstep all the way on the conscience of a pyncheon if so we are left to dispose of the awful query whether each inheritor of the property conscious of wrong and failing to rectify it did not commit anew the great guilt of his ancestor and incur all its original responsibilities and supposing such to be the case would it not be a far truer mode of expression to say of the pyncheon family that they inherited a great misfortune than the reverse we have already hinted that it is not our purpose to trace down the history of the pyncheon family in its unbroken connection with the house of the seven gables nor to show as in a magic picture how the rustiness and infirmity of age gathered over the venerable house itself as regards its interior life a large dim looking glass used to hang in one of the rooms and was fabled to contain within its depths all the shapes that had ever been reflected there the old colonel himself and his many descendants some in the garb of antique babyhood and others in the bloom of feminine beauty or manly prime or saddened with the wrinkles of frosty age had we the secret of that mirror we would gladly sit down before it and transfer its revelations to our page but there was a story for which it is difficult to conceive any foundation that the posterity of matthew maule had some connection with the mystery of the looking glass and that by what appears to have been a sort of mesmeric process they could make its inner region all alive with the departed pyncheons not as they had shown themselves to the world nor in their better and happier hours but as doing over again some deed of sin or in the crisis of life's bitterest sorrow the popular imagination indeed long kept itself busy with the affair of the old puritan pyncheon and the wizard maule the curse which the latter flung from his scaffold was remembered with the very important addition that it had become a part of the pyncheon inheritance if one of the family did but gurgle in his throat a bystander would be likely enough to whisper between jest and earnest he has maule's blood to drink the sudden death of a pyncheon about a hundred years ago with circumstances very similar to what have been related of the colonel's exit was held as giving additional probability to the received opinion on this topic it was considered moreover an ugly and ominous circumstance that colonel pyncheon's picture in obedience it was said to a provision of his will remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died those stern immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil influence and so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the sunshine of the passing hour that no good thoughts or purposes could ever spring up and blossom there to the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of superstition in what we figuratively express by affirming that the ghost of a dead progenitor perhaps as a portion of his own punishment is often doomed to become the evil genius of his family the pyncheons in brief lived along for the better part of two centuries with perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended most other new england families during the same period of time possessing very distinctive traits of their own they nevertheless took the general characteristics of the little community in which they dwelt a town noted for its frugal discreet well ordered and home loving inhabitants as well as for the somewhat confined scope of its sympathies but in which be it said there are odder individuals and now and then stranger occurrences than one meets with almost anywhere else during the revolution the pyncheon of that epoch adopting the royal side became a refugee but repented and made his reappearance just at the point of time to preserve the house of the seven gables from confiscation for the last seventy years the most noted event in the pyncheon annals had been likewise the heaviest calamity that ever befell the race no less than the violent death for so it was adjudged of one member of the family by the criminal act of another certain circumstances attending this fatal occurrence had brought the deed irresistibly home to a nephew of the deceased pyncheon the young man was tried and convicted of the crime but either the circumstantial nature of the evidence and possibly some lurking doubts in the breast of the executive or lastly an argument of greater weight in a republic than it could have been under a monarchy the high respectability and political influence of the criminal's connections had availed to mitigate his doom from death to perpetual imprisonment this sad affair had chanced about thirty years before the action of our story commences latterly there were rumors which few believed and only one or two felt greatly interested in that this long buried man was likely for some reason or other to be summoned forth from his living tomb it is essential to say a few words respecting the victim of this now almost forgotten murder he was an old bachelor and possessed of great wealth in addition to the house and real estate which constituted what remained of the ancient pyncheon property being of an eccentric and melancholy turn of mind and greatly given to rummaging old records and hearkening to old traditions he had brought himself it is averred to the conclusion that matthew maule the wizard had been foully wronged out of his homestead if not out of his life such being the case and he the old bachelor in possession of the ill gotten spoil with the black stain of blood sunken deep into it and still to be scented by conscientious nostrils the question occurred whether it were not imperative upon him even at this late hour to make restitution to maule's posterity to a man living so much in the past and so little in the present as the secluded and antiquarian old bachelor a century and a half seemed not so vast a period as to obviate the propriety of substituting right for wrong it was the belief of those who knew him best that he would positively have taken the very singular step of giving up the house of the seven gables to the representative of matthew maule but for the unspeakable tumult which a suspicion of the old gentleman's project awakened among his pyncheon relatives their exertions had the effect of suspending his purpose but it was feared that he would perform after death by the operation of his last will what he had so hardly been prevented from doing in his proper lifetime but there is no one thing which men so rarely do whatever the provocation or inducement as to bequeath patrimonial property away from their own blood they may love other individuals far better than their relatives they may even cherish dislike or positive hatred to the latter but yet in view of death the strong prejudice of propinquity revives and impels the testator to send down his estate in the line marked out by custom so immemorial that it looks like nature in all the pyncheons this feeling had the energy of disease it was too powerful for the conscientious scruples of the old bachelor at whose death accordingly the mansion house together with most of his other riches passed into the possession of his next legal representative this was a nephew the cousin of the miserable young man who had been convicted of the uncle's murder the new heir up to the period of his accession was reckoned rather a dissipated youth but had at once reformed and made himself an exceedingly respectable member of society in fact he showed more of the pyncheon quality and had won higher eminence in the world than any of his race since the time of the original puritan applying himself in earlier manhood to the study of the law and having a natural tendency towards office he had attained many years ago to a judicial situation in some inferior court which gave him for life the very desirable and imposing title of judge later he had engaged in politics and served a part of two terms in congress besides making a considerable figure in both branches of the state legislature judge pyncheon was unquestionably an honor to his race he had built himself a country seat within a few miles of his native town and there spent such portions of his time as could be spared from public service in the display of every grace and virtue as a newspaper phrased it on the eve of an election befitting the christian the good citizen the horticulturist and the gentleman there were few of the pyncheons left to sun themselves in the glow of the judge's prosperity in respect to natural increase the breed had not thriven it appeared rather to be dying out the only members of the family known to be extant were first the judge himself and a single surviving son who was now travelling in europe next the thirty years prisoner already alluded to and a sister of the latter who occupied in an extremely retired manner the house of the seven gables in which she had a life estate by the will of the old bachelor she was understood to be wretchedly poor and seemed to make it her choice to remain so inasmuch as her affluent cousin the judge had repeatedly offered her all the comforts of life either in the old mansion or his own modern residence the last and youngest pyncheon was a little country girl of seventeen the daughter of another of the judge's cousins who had married a young woman of no family or property and died early and in poor circumstances his widow had recently taken another husband as for matthew maule's posterity it was supposed now to be extinct for a very long period after the witchcraft delusion however the maules had continued to inhabit the town where their progenitor had suffered so unjust a death to all appearance they were a quiet honest well meaning race of people cherishing no malice against individuals or the public for the wrong which had been done them or if at their own fireside they transmitted from father to child any hostile recollection of the wizard's fate and their lost patrimony it was never acted upon nor openly expressed nor would it have been singular had they ceased to remember that the house of the seven gables was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that was rightfully their own there is something so massive stable and almost irresistibly imposing in the exterior presentment of established rank and great possessions that their very existence seems to give them a right to exist at least so excellent a counterfeit of right that few poor and humble men have moral force enough to question it even in their secret minds such is the case now after so many ancient prejudices have been overthrown and it was far more so in ante revolutionary days when the aristocracy could venture to be proud and the low were content to be abased thus the maules at all events kept their resentments within their own breasts they were generally poverty stricken always plebeian and obscure working with unsuccessful diligence at handicrafts laboring on the wharves or following the sea as sailors before the mast living here and there about the town in hired tenements and coming finally to the almshouse as the natural home of their old age at last after creeping as it were for such a length of time along the utmost verge of the opaque puddle of obscurity they had taken that downright plunge which sooner or later is the destiny of all families whether princely or plebeian for thirty years past neither town record nor gravestone nor the directory nor the knowledge or memory of man bore any trace of matthew maule's descendants his blood might possibly exist elsewhere here where its lowly current could be traced so far back it had ceased to keep an onward course so long as any of the race were to be found they
